Business

General
      Development of Business

Thermo
      Electron Corporation (also referred to in this document as “Thermo Electron,”
“we,” the “company,” or the “registrant”) is a world-wide provider of analytical
      instruments that enable customers to make the world a healthier, cleaner and
      safer place. We provide analytical instruments, scientific equipment, services
      and software solutions for life science, drug discovery, clinical, environmental
      and industrial laboratories, as well as for use in a variety of manufacturing
      processes and in-the-field applications including those associated with safety
      and homeland security.

In
      the
      late 1980s, Thermo Electron adopted a strategy of spinning out certain
      businesses into separate public subsidiaries in which we kept a majority
      ownership. By 1997, we had spun out 22 public entities serving many diverse
      markets. To simplify our structure, we announced in January 2000 a major
      reorganization that ultimately resulted in taking private all of our public
      subsidiaries, selling non-core businesses and spinning off our paper recycling
      and medical products businesses. As part of the reorganization, we divested
      of
      businesses with aggregate annual revenues of over $2 billion. This
      reorganization was substantially completed in February 2002, when we took
      private our last publicly traded subsidiary. In July 2004, we sold
      Spectra-Physics, Inc., our optical technologies segment (Note 16).

The
      businesses spun off and sold have been accounted for as discontinued operations.
      The company’s continuing operations are comprised solely of its instrument
      businesses.

Except
      where indicated, the information presented in this report pertains to our
      continuing operations.

Our
      current strategy is to drive internal growth by developing for our customers
      those products, services and solutions with the highest growth potential. In
      addition, we plan to augment that growth with strategic acquisitions that expand
      the reach of our technology and services by either rounding out our product
      lines or bringing them to new markets. Our strategy for growth also includes
      expanding our presence in developing geographic markets such as Asia, in
      particular China and India, where economic development is contributing to demand
      for our products. Our strategy is also to continue to improve productivity,
      enabling us to better serve our customers with improved products, technologies
      and complete integrated systems and services.

Thermo
      Electron is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 1956. The company
      completed its initial public offering in 1967 and was listed on the New York
      Stock Exchange in 1980.

Mass
      spectrometry is a technique for analyzing chemical compounds, individually
      or in
      complex mixtures, by forming gas phase charged ions that are then analyzed
      according to mass-to-charge ratios. In addition to molecular information, each
      discrete chemical compound generates a fragmentation pattern that provides
      structurally diagnostic information. Chromatography is a technique for
      separating, identifying and quantifying individual chemical components of
      substances based on physical and chemical characteristics specific to each
      component. Optical spectroscopy is a technique for analyzing individual chemical
      components of substances based on the absorption or emission of electromagnetic
      radiation of a specific wavelength of light, for example, visible (light),
      ultraviolet or infra-red.

      are important in both segments of our business. No particular patent, or related
      group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly
      affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection
      for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into
      our
      products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest. Patent rights
      resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue
      exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or
      contracts.

We
      protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we
      use
      trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We also
      enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to
      patents and know-how.

Seasonal
      Influences

Revenues
      in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in the other
      quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and
      government customers.

Working
      Capital Requirements

There
      are
      no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that
      would have a material adverse effect on our working capital.

Dependency
      on a Single Customer

There
      is
      no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on
      our
      business. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in
      any
      of the past three years.

Backlog

Our
      backlog of firm orders at year-end 2005 and 2004 was as follows:

We believe that
        virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2005 will be filled during 2006.
        The
        increase in backlog in 2005 in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment is
        due
        to acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased demand, offset in part
        by the
        impact of currency translation.

Government
      Contracts

Although
      the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government
      contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination
      of
      the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material
      adverse effect on the company’s financial results.

Competition

General

The
      company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the
      markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we
      face
      many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors range
      from
      large organizations that produce a comprehensive array of products and services
      for a variety of markets to small organizations producing a limited number
      of

      in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer
      demands that require continuing research and development. Our success in these
      markets primarily depends on five factors:

Risk
                  Factors

Set
      forth
      below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section
      contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of
      the
      qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page
      3.

We
      must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change
      and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive.

Our
      growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product
      development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized
      by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service
      introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Without the
      timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products
      and
      services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case
      our revenue and operating results would suffer.

Development
      of our products requires significant investment; our products and technologies
      could become uncompetitive or obsolete.

Our
      customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own
      products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products
      in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to
      adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest
      heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead
      to
      significant revenue.

Many
      of
      our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative
      and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the
      technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. These activities
      require us to make significant investments.

Products
      in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of
      quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and
      technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or
      obsolete. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes
      in customers’ requirements than we can. The products that we are currently
      developing, or those we will develop in the future, may not be technologically
      feasible or accepted by the marketplace, and our products or technologies could
      become uncompetitive or obsolete.

It
      may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal
      growth.

Some
      of
      the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past
      several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies
      to
      improve our internal growth, including:

·

finding
                new markets for our products;

·

developing
                new applications for our technologies;

·

combining
                sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete
                more
                effectively;

·

allocating
                research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;

·

continuing
                key customer initiatives;

·

expanding
                our service offerings;

·

strengthening
                our presence in selected geographic markets; and

·

continuing
                the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase
                and
                support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take
                advantage of our breadth in product
                offerings.

We
      may
      not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies
      may
      not result in the growth of our business.

Our
      inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse
      effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe
      their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or
      licensing expense as a result.

We place
      considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for
      significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length
      of
      time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development
      process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability
      to
      develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our
      products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous
      U.S.
      and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as
      appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for
      any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the
      claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect
      our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged,
      invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide
      us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around
      our
      technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights
      may
      also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make
      it
      easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur
      substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits
      in
      which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome
      of
      any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results
      of operations.

We
      also
      rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect
      our
      products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators,
      employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not
      have
      adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise
      become known or be independently developed by our competitors.

          Statement Index

          of Contents

Third
      parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on
      their intellectual property rights. For example, in September 2004 Applied
      Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments and related parties brought a lawsuit
      against us alleging our mass spectrometer systems infringe a patent held by
      the
      plaintiffs. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management
      resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect
      on

our
      business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, parties
      making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as
      well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block
      our
      ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services
      in
      the United States or abroad. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual
      property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold
      pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may
      seek
      licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However,
      we
      may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if
      at
      all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain
      the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture,
      or
      distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse
      effect on our business, financial condition and results of
      operations.

Demand
      for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers
      and on government funding policies.

Our
      customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories,
      universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private
      research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending
      priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a
      significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. These
      policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our
      products.

Our
      results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future benefits
      from new productivity initiatives.

We
      continue to pursue practical process improvement (PPI) programs and other cost
      saving initiatives at our locations which are designed to further enhance our
      productivity, efficiency and customer satisfaction. While we anticipate
      continued benefits from these initiatives, future benefits are expected to
      be
      fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve.

Our
      Measurement and Control segment sells products and services to a number of
      companies that operate in cyclical industries; downturns in those industries
      would adversely affect our results of operations.

The
      growth and profitability of some of our businesses in the Measurement and
      Control segment depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to
      cyclical downturns. For example, certain businesses in this segment depend
      in
      part on sales to the steel, cement and semiconductor industries. Slowdowns
      in
      these industries would adversely affect sales by these businesses, which in
      turn
      would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.

Our
      business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties
      affecting markets in which we operate.

Adverse
      economic conditions could adversely impact our business in 2006 and beyond,
      resulting in:

·

reduced
                demand for some of our products;

·

increased
                rate of order cancellations or
                delays;

·

increased
                risk of excess and obsolete
                inventories;

·

increased
                pressure on the prices for our products and services;
                and

·

greater
                difficulty in collecting accounts
                receivable.

Changes
      in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase
      our
      expenses.

We
      compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal,
      state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and
      safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our
      products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant
      change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our
      expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the
      pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes
      in
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and
      development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these
      products.

If
      any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could
      be
      exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have
      adequate insurance coverage.

The
      products sold by our environmental instruments division include a comprehensive
      range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace
      explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo
      facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection
      and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction,
      it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the
      product undetected, which could lead to product liability claims. There are
      also
      many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims,
      such
      as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training
      of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could
      be
      significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess
      of
      our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot
      be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims
      or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.

Our
      branding strategy could be unsuccessful.

We
      historically operated our business largely as autonomous, unaffiliated
      companies, and as a result, each of our businesses independently created and
      developed its own brand names. Our marketing and branding strategy transitions
      multiple, unrelated brands to one brand, Thermo Electron. Several of our former
      brands such as Finnigan and Nicolet commanded strong market recognition and
      customer loyalty. We believe the transition to the one brand enhances and
      strengthens our collective brand image and brand awareness across the entire
      company. Our success in promoting our brand depends on many factors, including
      effective communication of the transition to our customers, acceptance and
      recognition by customers of this brand and successful execution of the branding
      campaign by our marketing and sales teams. If we are not successful with this
      strategy, we may experience erosion in our product recognition, brand image
      and
      customer loyalty and a decrease in demand for our products.

Our
      inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully
      integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect
      on our business.

Our
      business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that
      complement or augment our existing products and services. Promising acquisitions
      are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including
      competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including
      antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete
      transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial
      premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. Further,
      we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our
      existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated
      cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could
      adversely affect our business. For example, we will need to integrate the Kendro
      business that we recently acquired in order to realize its anticipated cost
      savings and synergies.

Moreover,
      we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these
      acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet, which
      amounts to approximately $1.97 billion as of December 31, 2005. We assess the
      realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever
      events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired.
      These events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a
      significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset.
      Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future
      cash
      flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well
      we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value
      of
      the goodwill, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the
      impairment of those assets.

We
      have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold.

From
      through 2004, we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues
      in
      excess of $2 billion. As part of these transactions, we retained responsibility
      for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses, such as
      lawsuits, product liability and environmental claims and potential claims by
      buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were
      inaccurate. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse
      effect on our results of operations or financial condition; however, we can
      not
      be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.

As
      a
      multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange
      rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of
      operations.

International revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and
      we
      intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets. In 2005,
      our
      international revenues from continuing operations, including export revenues
      from the United States, accounted for approximately 58% of our total revenues.
      The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different
      forms. International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in
      exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability
      in
      U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets,
      where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency.
      As a
      multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party
      customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business
      (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the
      functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of
      operations. In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by our
      international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial
      reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Should our
      international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
      could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2005, currency
      translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations
      of $4.5 million due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other
      currencies in which the company sells products and services. In 2004, currency
      translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations
      of
      $92.1 million due to weakening of the U.S. dollar.

We
      are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure
      to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could
      harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these
      customers.

We
      have
      agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and,
      as a
      result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to
      companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government
      contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government
      contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable
      to
      private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with
      the
      regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these
      regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil
      and
      administrative penalties or debarment.

Unforeseen
      problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems
      could interfere with our operations.

As
      a part
      of the effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing
      new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to
      manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add
      functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems
      could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner:
      provide quotes, take customer orders, ship products, provide services and
      support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual
      obligations and otherwise run our business. In addition, if our new systems
      fail
      to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures,
      it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As a result,
      our
      results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Our
      debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment
      opportunities or limit our activities.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had approximately $598.8 million in outstanding
      indebtedness.

We
      have
      $250 million in additional borrowing capacity available to us under our
      revolving credit facility and $83 million available under our euro facility.
      We
      may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future
      financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total
      leverage.

Our
      leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our
      vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability
      to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products
      and technologies through strategic acquisitions.

Financial
          Statement Index


Table
          of Contents

Our
      ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance
      and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
      Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations.
      If
      we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing, we may be
      forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and
      development expenditures. We may not be able to obtain additional financing
      on
      terms acceptable to us or at all.

Additionally,
      the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial
      ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our
      activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional
      indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into
      transactions with affiliates. The financial covenants in our U.S. dollar
      revolving credit facility and euro facility include interest coverage and
      debt-to-capital ratios. Specifically, the company agrees that, so long as the
      commitments remain in effect or any loan or other amount is outstanding under
      the loan agreements, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined
      in
      the loan agreements):

·

the
                Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA
                to
                Consolidated Interest Expense) for any period of four consecutive
                fiscal
                quarters to be less than 3.25:1.00;
                or

·

the
                Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated Total Capitalization ratio
                at the
                end of any fiscal quarter to be greater than
                0.50:1.00.

Our
      ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent
      on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions
      and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign
      exchange rates and interest rates.

Our
      failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in
      an
      event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit
      acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that
      debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under
      one
      of our debt instruments

would
      trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.

Earthquakes
      could disrupt our operations in California.

One
      of
      the company’s principal operations, which manufactures analytical instruments,
      is located in San Jose, a region near major California earthquake faults. Our
      operating results could be materially affected in the event of a major
      earthquake.

Legal
                Proceedings

On
      September 3, 2004, Applera Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS
      Scientific Instruments filed a complaint against the company in U.S. District
      Court for the District of Delaware, Civil Action No. 04-1230-GMS. These
      plaintiffs allege that the company’s mass spectrometer systems, including its
      triple quadrupole and certain of its ion trap systems, infringe U.S. patent
      number 4,963,736 entitled “Mass Spectrometer and Method and Improved Ion
      Transmission.” The plaintiffs seek damages, including treble damages for alleged
      willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest and injunctive
      relief. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on the
      company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

On
      December 8, 2004 and February 23, 2005, the company asserted in two lawsuits
      in
      the same Delaware court, that one or more of the plaintiffs in the above action
      infringe two patents of the company

(U.S.
      patent number 5,385,654 entitled “Controlled Temperature Anion Separation by
      Capillary Electrophoresis” and U.S. patent number 6,528,784 entitled “Mass
      Spectrometer System Including a Double Ion Guide Interface and Method of
      Operation”).

The
      lawsuits brought by the company seek relief similar to that being sought by
      the
      plaintiffs.

Management’s
                Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Reference
      is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
      Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.

Overview
      of Results of Operations and Liquidity

The
      company develops and manufactures a
      broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product
      lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core
      technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses.
      In 2004, the company sold Spectra-Physics, its optical technologies segment
      which has been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying
      financial statements. The company’s continuing operations fall into two
      principal business segments: Life and Laboratory Sciences and Measurement and
      Control. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other
      quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and
      government customers.

The
        company’s revenues grew by 19% during 2005. The increase was due in part to
        acquisitions, net of divestitures. The strengthening of the dollar relative
        to
        non-U.S. currencies caused a decrease in reported revenues. In addition to
        the
        change in revenues caused by acquisitions, net of divestitures and currency
        translation, which are discussed below, sales increased 4% in 2005, primarily
        due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher
        prices.

The
      company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with
      complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2005 and 2004. The
      principal acquisitions included Ionalytics Corporation, a provider of an
      ion-filtering device used with mass spectrometers, which was acquired in August
      2005; the Kendro Laboratory Products division of SPX Corporation, a provider
      of
      a wide range of laboratory equipment for sample preparation, processing and
      storage, which was acquired in May 2005; Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc.
      (R&P), a provider of continuous particulate monitoring instrumentation for
      the ambient air, emissions monitoring and industrial hygiene markets, which
      was
      acquired in April 2005; Niton LLC, a provider of portable X-ray analyzers to
      the
      metals, petrochemical and environmental markets, which was acquired in March
      2005; InnaPhase Corporation, a supplier of

laboratory
      information management systems for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets,
      which was acquired in September 2004; and US Counseling Services, Inc. (USCS),
      a
      supplier of equipment asset management services to the pharmaceutical,
      healthcare and related industries, which was acquired in April
      2004.

In
      2005,
      the company’s operating income and operating income margin were $263.5 million
      and 10.0%, respectively, compared with $237.5 million and 10.8%, respectively,
      in 2004. (Operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues.)
      The
      increase in operating income was due to higher revenues, productivity
      improvements including lower costs following restructuring actions and, to
      a
      lesser extent, price increases, offset in part by $54.8 million of higher
      amortization expense associated with acquisition-related intangible assets.
      Operating income margin decreased due to lower operating margins on revenue
      from
      acquisitions as a result of amortization of acquisition-related intangible
      assets. Restructuring and other costs, net, (including charges to cost of
      revenues principally associated with the sale of inventories revalued at the
      date of acquisition) reduced operating income by $30.3 million and $19.2 million
      in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The
      company’s effective tax rate was 30.6% and 15.8% in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
      The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4.2 million for the estimated
      effect of tax audits of prior years in a non-U.S. country. This charge increased
      the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. The provision for
      income taxes in 2004 includes a benefit of $33.8 million associated with the
      settlement of U.S. and state tax audits of prior years. This benefit reduced
      the
      company’s effective tax rate by 13.0 percentage points.

Income
      from continuing operations decreased to $198.3 million in 2005, from $218.4
      million in 2004, primarily due to the effect of tax audits in both years and
      higher amortization expense, discussed above, offset in part by higher operating
      income from increased revenues as well as an increase in other
      income.

During
      2005, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $270.9 million, compared
      with $264.5 million in 2004.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $598.8 million, of
      which 65% is due in 2008 and thereafter. The company expects that its existing
      cash and short-term investments of $295.0 million as of December 31, 2005,
      and
      the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured
      borrowings of up to $250 million under its existing 5-year revolving credit
      agreement and available unsecured borrowings under its 5-year euro facility
      are
      sufficient to meet its capital requirements for the foreseeable future,
      including at least the next 24 months.

Critical
      Accounting Policies

The
      company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of
      operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared
      in
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
      of
      America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company
      to
      make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
      liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
      liabilities. On an on-going basis, the company evaluates its estimates,
      including those related to equity investments, bad debts, inventories,
      intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs,
      contingencies and litigation, restructuring and sale of businesses. The company
      bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic
      conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The
      results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying
      value
      of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other
      sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
      assumptions or conditions.

          of Contents

The
      company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and
      estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:

(a)

The
                company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
                losses
                resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due.
                Such
                allowances totaled $21.8 million at December 31, 2005. The company
                estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible
                based
                on the age of the

receivable,
                the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that
                is
                relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s
                customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments,
                additional allowances would be
                required.

(b)

The
                company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for
                differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking
                into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand
                and
                any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate
                usage
                or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand, additional
                writedowns may be required.

(c)

The
                company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using forecasts
                of
                discounted future cash flows. Goodwill totaled $1.97 billion at December
                31, 2005. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related
                to
                revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures,
                working
                capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those
                made in
                the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and
                the company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment. Should the fair value
                of the company’s goodwill decline because of reduced operating
                performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment,
                or as a
                result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment of
                goodwill
                may be necessary.

(d)

The
                company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible
                assets
                principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from
                identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected
                cash
                flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets
                at the
                dates of acquisition. Actual cash flows arising from a particular
                intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could
                imply
                different carrying values and annual amortization expense from those
                established at the dates of
                acquisition.

(e)

The
                company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication
                of
                potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash
                flows
                associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $931.5
                million
                at December 31, 2005, including $280.7 million of fixed assets. In
                testing
                a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning
                projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future
                cash
                flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income
                growth
                and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed
                for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from
                estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets
                may
                be necessary.

(f)

In
                  instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation
                  obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to
                  the
                  equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related
                  to the
                  installation when it performs the installation. The allocation
                  of revenue
                  between the equipment and the installation is based on relative
                  fair value
                  at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment
                  or the
                  installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected.
                  If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue
                  for
                  all elements is deferred until delivery is
                  completed.

(g)

In
                  instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified
                  acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate
                  adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance
                  testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the
                  nature of
                  customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in
                  complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence,
                  the
                  company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment
                  of
                  its products until completion of customer acceptance
                  testing.

The
                company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products
                and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license
                revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either
                been
                delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value
                exists for

any
                undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any
                undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery
                is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts
                are
                recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
                VSOE of
                fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based
                on the
                price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately.
                Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as
                services
                are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to
                the
                price customers pay when the services are sold separately.

(i)

At
                  the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated
                  cost of product warranties and returns based primarily on historical
                  experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that
                  indicate
                  projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The
                  liability
                  for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled
                  $33.5 million at December 31, 2005. Should product failure rates
                  or the
                  actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates,
                  revisions
                  to the estimated warranty liability would be
                  necessary.

(j)

The
                  company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards
                  will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax
                  jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets
                  and loss
                  carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
                  If it
                  becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward
                  will be
                  used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance with
                  an offset
                  generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from
                  acquisitions. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $63.5 million
                  at December 31, 2005. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by
                  tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or
                  reversals
                  thereof may be necessary.

(k)

The
                company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the
                worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income
                taxes
                totaled $55.1 million at December 31, 2005. Should tax return positions
                that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit,
                the
                company could be required to record an incremental tax provision
                for such
                taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be
                sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would
                result.

(l)

The
                company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation for which
                a loss
                is probable and provides a reserve for losses that can be reasonably
                estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies and litigation
                vary
                from estimates, adjustments to those reserves may be
                required.

(m)

One
                of the company’s U.S. subsidiaries and several non-U.S. subsidiaries
                sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Major assumptions used in
                the
                accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount
                rate,
                expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee
                compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company
                data and
                appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries,
                and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net
                periodic pension costs for defined benefit plans totaled $16.1 million
                in
                2005 and the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $124 million at
                year-end 2005. Should any of these assumptions change, they would
                have an
                effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
                For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in
                an annual
                increase in pension expense of approximately $3 million and an increase
                in
                the benefit obligation of approximately $31 million.

                  these
                  assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated
                  proceeds, which would include post-closing purchase price adjustments,
                  vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected

Sales
      in
      2005 were $2.633 billion, an increase of $427.0 million (19%) from 2004. Sales
      increased $337.3 million (15%) due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The
      unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues
      of $4.5 million in 2005. Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of
      divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $94.2 million (4%)
      primarily due to increased demand, and to a lesser extent, price increases,
      as
      described by segment below. Growth was strong in Asia and moderate in North
      America and Europe.

Operating
                Income Margin



Consolidated

10.0%

10.8%

Operating
      income was $263.5 million in 2005, compared with $237.5 million in 2004.
      Operating income increased due to higher sales, including revenues from
      acquisitions, offset in part by the items discussed below. Operating income
      margin decreased to 10.0% in 2005 from 10.8% in 2004, primarily due to $54.8
      million of higher amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets
      and $10.0 million of higher charges to cost of revenues, primarily for the
      sale
      of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. These factors were offset
      in
      part by higher profitability from the increase in revenues and, to a lesser
      extent, price increases.

In
      response to a downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with
      the company’s overall reorganization, restructuring actions were initiated in
      2003 and, to a lesser extent, 2004 in a number of business units to reduce
      costs
      and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation
      of
      facilities. Restructuring and other costs recorded in 2005 were primarily for
      reductions in staffing levels at existing businesses resulting from the
      integration of Kendro and consolidation of two facilities in Texas. The
      restructuring actions undertaken prior to 2005 were substantially complete
      at
      the end of 2004. The 2005 costs include charges associated with actions
      initiated prior to 2005 that could not be recorded until incurred and
      adjustments to previously provided reserves due to changes in estimates of
      amounts due for abandoned facilities, net of expected sub-tenant rental income.
      The company is continuing to evaluate potential restructuring actions that
      may
      be undertaken at Kendro or within existing businesses with which Kendro is
      being
      integrated. Such actions may include rationalization of product lines,
      consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels. The cost of
      actions at Kendro businesses is being charged to the cost of the acquisition
      while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with Kendro
      are charged to expense. The company has not finalized its plans for integrating
      Kendro with its existing business but expects that charges to expense will
      ultimately total $15 - $20 million, of which approximately $8 million has been
      recorded as of December 31, 2005. The company expects to finalize its
      restructuring plans for Kendro no later than one year from the date of
      acquisition.

In
      2005,
      the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $30.3 million,
      including charges to cost of revenues of $13.4 million primarily for the sale
      of
      inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company incurred $23.2
      million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and
      relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro with existing
      businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8.0 million primarily
      from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $1.7 million
      principally for the writedown of a building held for sale. In 2004, the company
      recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19.2 million, including charges
      to cost of revenues of $3.4 million, consisting of $2.3 million for the sale
      of
      inventories revalued at the date of acquisition of Jouan and $1.1 million of
      accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility
      consolidations. The company incurred $17.4 million of cash costs, primarily
      for
      severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that
      have
      been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $2.6 million
      on
      the sale of a product line and a loss of $1.0 million from the writedown of
      abandoned equipment and the sale of two abandoned buildings (Note 15). The
      restructuring actions initiated in 2005 resulted in annual cost savings
      beginning in the second half of 2005 and early 2006 of approximately $13
      million, including $9 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and
      $4
      million in the Measurement and Control segment. The company expects to incur
      an
      additional $2 million of restructuring costs, primarily in 2006, for charges
      associated with these actions that cannot be recorded until
      incurred.

Segment
      Results

The
      company’s management evaluates operating segment performance based on measures
      that are not determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
      principles including adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income
      margin. Adjusted operating income is segment operating income before certain
      charges to cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting;
      restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility
      consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and
      losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of
      acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because
      they help management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating
      results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation.
      Adjusted operating income margin is adjusted operating income divided by
      revenues.

Sales
      in
      the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $386.7 million (25%) to
      $1,960.2 billion in 2005. Sales increased $334.8 million due to the acquisitions
      of Kendro in May 2005, Niton in March 2005, InnaPhase in September 2004 and
      USCS
      in April 2004, net of divestitures, principally the point of care and rapid
      diagnostics business in September 2005. The unfavorable effects of currency
      translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $5.0 million in 2005. In
      addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures
      and
      currency translation, revenues increased $56.9 million (4%) due to higher
      broad-based demand from life science and industrial customers combined with
      strong market response to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases.
      Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy
      instruments and, to a lesser extent, anatomical pathology products.

Adjusted
      operating income margin was 16.7% in 2005 and 16.2% in 2004. The increase
      resulted from higher revenues including the effect of acquisitions, and to
      a
      lesser extent, price increases and cost reduction measures following
      restructuring actions.

Charges
      to cost of revenues relate to the sale of inventories revalued at the date
      of
      acquisition and increased in 2005 due to the Kendro acquisition. The increase
      in

Sales
      in
      the Measurement and Control segment increased $40.3 million (6%) to $672.9
      million in 2005. Sales increased $2.4 million due to acquisitions, net of
      divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an
      increase in revenues of $0.6 million in 2005. In addition to the changes in
      revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation,
      revenues increased $37.3 million (6%). The increase was primarily the result
      of
      higher demand from industrial customers, particularly from commodity markets
      including steel, petroleum and cement and customers purchasing instruments
      for
      use in environmental and security applications. Growth was strong in Asia and,
      to a lesser extent, in North America. The increase in revenues was, to a lesser
      extent, due to price increases.

Adjusted
      operating income margin increased to 11.9% in 2005 from 9.9% in 2004. The
      increase resulted from higher sales volumes and cost reduction measures
      following restructuring actions.

The
      increase in restructuring costs in 2005 primarily related to the consolidation
      of two facilities in Texas. The increase in amortization of acquisition-related
      intangible assets was due primarily to the acquisition of R&P.

Other
      Income, Net

The
      company reported other income, net, of $22.4 million and $21.7 million in 2005
      and 2004, respectively (Note 4). Other income, net, includes interest income,
      interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated
      subsidiaries and other items, net. Interest income increased to $11.6 million
      in
      2005 from $9.0 million in 2004, primarily due to higher invested cash balances
      following the sale of Spectra-Physics in July 2004 and, to a lesser extent,
      increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to fund
      acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $26.7 million in 2005 from $11.0
      million in 2004, as a result of debt used to partially fund the Kendro
      acquisition and, to a lesser extent, higher rates associated with the company’s
      variable-rate debt.

During
      2005 and 2004, the company had gains on investments, net, of $35.3 million
      and
      $20.8 million, respectively. The gains included $28.9 million in 2005 and $9.6
      million in 2004 from the sale of shares of Thoratec Corporation and a loss
      of
      $1.3 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Newport Corporation, in addition
      to other gains from the company’s investment portfolio activity. The company
      obtained common shares of Thoratec as part of the sale of Thermo Cardiosystems
      Inc. in 2001 and obtained the shares of Newport as part of the sale of
      Spectra-Physics in 2004. The company no longer owns shares of Thoratec or
      Newport and does not expect to report material gains or losses from investments
      in 2006. Other income in 2005 and 2004 also includes net currency transaction
      gains and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries.

Provision
      for Income Taxes

The
      company’s effective tax rate was 30.6% and 15.8% in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
      The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4.2 million for the estimated
      effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non-U.S. country. The effect of this
      charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. The
      effective tax rate was lower in 2004 primarily due to $33.8 million of tax
      benefits associated with the completion of tax audits. The company’s federal tax
      returns and those of several subsidiaries were under audit for the period 1998
      to 2000. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final
      settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously
      unrecognized tax benefits were realizable. In addition, audits of state tax
      returns were also completed in 2004. This tax benefit reduced the company’s
      effective tax rate in 2004 by 13.0 percentage points.

Contingent
      Liabilities

At
      year-end 2005, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain
      lawsuits. An unfavorable outcome in either of the pending matters described
      under “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 11 could materially affect
      the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash
      flows.

Recent
      Accounting Pronouncements

In
      June
      2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 143-1, “Accounting for Electronic Equipment
      Waste Obligations” to address the accounting for obligations associated with EU
      Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. The directive
      requires EU member countries to adopt legislation to regulate the collection,
      treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and
      electronic waste equipment. Under the directive, the waste management obligation
      for historical equipment (products put on the market on or prior to August
      13,
      2005) remains with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced.
      Depending upon the law adopted by the particular country, upon replacement,
      the
      waste management obligation for that equipment may be transferred to the
      producer of the related equipment. The user retains the obligation if they
      do
      not replace the equipment. FSP No. FAS 143-1 requires a commercial user to
      apply
      the provisions of SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”
and related FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
      Retirement Obligations” to waste obligations associated with historical
      equipment. The rules require that a liability be established for the retirement
      obligation with an offsetting increase to the carrying amount of the related
      asset. FSP No. FAS 143-1 is effective the later of the first reporting period
      ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of adoption of the law by the applicable
      EU member country. The issuance of FSP No. FAS 143-1 is not expected to have
      a
      material impact on the company’s financial statements.

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No.
      123(R) amends SFAS No. 123 to require that companies record as expense the
      effect of equity-based compensation, including stock options over the applicable
      vesting period. The company currently discloses the effect on income that stock
      options would have were they recorded as expense. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires
      more extensive disclosures concerning stock options than required under current
      standards. The new rule applies to option grants made after adoption as well
      as
      options that are not vested at the date of adoption. SFAS No. 123(R) becomes
      effective in 2006. The company will apply the new standard using the modified
      prospective method in the first quarter of 2006. If the company had adopted
      this
      standard in 2005, the company’s net income for 2005 would have been $13.6
      million (or $.08 per diluted share) lower than reported in 2005. The company
      expects that adoption of this standard will result in a reduction in net income
      of approximately $16 million (or $.10 per diluted share) during
      2006.

In
      November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs - an amendment of
      ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” which is the result of its efforts to converge U.S.
      accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards.
      SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
      handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) to be recognized as current-period
      charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to
      the
      costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
      facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during
      2006. The company does not expect the new standard to have a material effect
      on
      its financial statements.

Discontinued
      Operations

The
      company had after-tax gains of $24.9 million in 2005 and $100.5 million in
      from the disposal of discontinued operations and $43.0 million of after-tax
      income in 2004 from discontinued operations.

An
      after-tax gain of $16.8 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the
      company’s point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53.1 million in
      cash. Revenues and pre-tax loss of the divested business totaled $29.7 million
      and $0.7 million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre-tax income totaled
      $26.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale.
      Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative
      to
      consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results
      and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In addition to the
      sale of this business, the company had after-tax gains aggregating $8.1 million
      in 2005 from the sale of abandoned real estate; additional proceeds from the
      sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned
      real
      estate and post-closing adjustments; and the settlement of litigation and an
      arbitration award related to a divested business.

In
      July
      2004, the company completed the sale of its Optical Technologies segment,
      Spectra-Physics, to Newport. The company has reclassified the results of
      Spectra-Physics as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the
      accompanying financial statements.

The
      company’s discontinued operations (Spectra-Physics) had revenues through the
      date of sale of $118.9 million in 2004. Net income of the discontinued
      operations through the date of sale in 2004 was $4.5 million, net of a tax
      provision of $2.2 million. As a result of the decision to sell Spectra-Physics,
      a previously unrecognized tax asset arising from the difference between the
      book
      and tax basis of Spectra-Physics became realizable and the company recorded
      a
      tax benefit as income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million in
      2004. In addition, the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra-Physics
      of
      $45.9 million, net of a tax provision of $15.9 million.

The
      tax
      returns of the company and its former Trex Medical and ThermoLase businesses
      were under audit by the IRS. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company
      reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that
      previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the divested businesses
      totaling $52.7 million were realizable. These tax benefits were recorded as
      a
      gain on the disposal of discontinued operations in 2004.

In
      addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1.3 million of
      after-tax gains and $0.6 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued
      operations.

      million in 2004. Sales increased $134.4 million due to acquisitions, net of
      divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency
      translation, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased $80.1 million,
      or

Restructuring
      actions were initiated in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, in 2004 in a number
      of
      business units to reduce costs and redundancies in response to a downturn in
      markets served by the company and in connection with the company’s overall
      reorganization, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation
      of
      facilities. The actions initiated in 2004 resulted in annual cost savings
      beginning in late 2004 and early 2005 of approximately $10 million, including
      $7
      million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and $3 million in the
      Measurement and Control segment. The actions initiated in 2003 resulted in
      annual cost reductions beginning in late 2003 and early 2004 of approximately
      $11 million, including $7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment
      and $4 million in the Measurement and Control segment.

In
      2004,
      the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19.2 million,
      including charges to cost of revenues of $3.4 million, consisting of $2.3
      million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition of
      Jouan
      and $1.1 million of accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned
      due
      to facility consolidations. The company incurred $17.4 million of cash costs,
      primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at
      businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a
      gain
      of $2.6 million on the sale of a product line and a loss of $1.0 million from
      the writedown of abandoned equipment and the sale of two abandoned buildings.
      In
      2003, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $45.3 million,
      including $37.4 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned
      facilities, employee retention and relocation expenses at businesses being
      consolidated. In addition, the company recorded net charges of $3.4 million,
      to
      write down the carrying value of fixed assets, primarily buildings held for
      sale, to expected disposal value, and $2.0 million, primarily for the writedown
      of goodwill in the test and measurement business to reduce the carrying value
      to
      disposal value, and for the writedown of assets at facilities being
      consolidated. These charges were offset by a gain of $2.1 million on the sale
      of
      a building and $0.4 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of a product
      line. The company also recorded charges to cost of revenues of $0.1 million
      for
      the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition
      (Note 15).

      acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $60.6
      million, or 5%, due to higher demand. The increase in demand resulted
      principally in higher sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments
      and, to a lesser extent, new anatomical pathology products and laboratory
      informatics. The combination of new products and a rebound in sales to
      industrial markets along with strength in pharmaceutical demand contributed
      to

the
      instrument sales growth, offset in part by lower revenues in Europe where the
      recovery of demand lagged the U.S. and Asia. The increase in revenues was offset
      in part by $5.6 million of lower revenue from rapid diagnostic tests due to
      a
      weak flu season in 2004 following a harsh season in 2003.

Adjusted
      operating income margin was 16.2% in 2004 and 16.4% in 2003. The inclusion
      of
      Jouan, USCS and LMSi, which have historically operated at lower profitability
      margins compared with the segment’s existing businesses contributed to the
      reduction and was offset in part by the impact of higher revenue.

The
      decrease in restructuring and other costs, net, was due to the completion of
      several significant facility consolidation actions undertaken in 2003. The
      increase in amortization expense resulted from 2003 and 2004
      acquisitions.

Sales
      in
      the Measurement and Control segment increased $31.4 million (5%) to $632.6
      million in 2004. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in
      an
      increase in revenues of $25.4 million (4%) in 2004. Sales decreased $13.5
      million (2%) due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. The principal divestiture
      was the segment’s test and measurement business, which it sold in October 2003.
      In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation,
      acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased $19.5 million (3%). The
      increase was primarily the result of a rebound in demand for precision
      temperature-control products from the semiconductor industry and other process
      applications and, to a lesser extent, process instruments used by the materials
      industry and equipment used in metal production, particularly in
      China.

Adjusted
      operating income margin increased to 9.9% in 2004 from 9.5% in 2003. The
      increase in operating income margin resulted from higher sales volumes and
      cost
      reduction measures following restructuring actions.

The
      decrease in restructuring and other costs, net, was due to the completion of
      several significant facility consolidation actions undertaken in
      2003.

Other
      Income, Net

The
      company reported other income, net, of $21.7 million and $35.2 million in 2004
      and 2003, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $9.0 million
      in
      2004 from $19.7 million in 2003, primarily due to lower invested cash balances
      following the acquisitions (net of divestitures) in late 2003 and 2004 and
      the
      use of cash for the repurchase and redemption of company securities. Interest
      expense decreased to $11.0 million in 2004 from $18.2 million in 2003, as a
      result of the repurchase and redemption of debentures.

During
      2004 and 2003, the company had gains on investments, net, of $20.8 million
      and
      $35.5 million, respectively. The gains included $9.6 million in 2004 and $16.3
      million in 2003 from the sale of shares of Thoratec and $13.7 million in 2003
      from the sale of shares of FLIR Systems, Inc. The company obtained an equity
      interest in FLIR as part of the acquisition of Spectra-Physics AB in 1999.
      Other
      income in 2004 and 2003 also includes currency transaction gains and losses
      and
      equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. In addition, the company
      repurchased and redeemed debentures, resulting in a charge of $1.0 million
      during 2003.

Provision
      for Income Taxes

The
      company’s effective tax rate was 15.8% and 21.3% in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
      The effective tax rate decreased in 2004 primarily due to $33.8 million of
      tax
      benefits associated with the completion of tax audits. The 2003 effective tax
      rate was favorably affected by $9.0 million of tax benefit from the reversal
      of
      a valuation allowance due to expected utilization of foreign tax credit
      carryforwards (Note 6) and $3.7 million of tax benefit from the sale of a
      business. These tax benefits reduced the company’s 2004 and 2003 effective tax
      rates by 13.0 percentage points and 5.7 percentage points, respectively. In
      addition, the company reduced its effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points
      in
      2003 through repatriation of cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, which resulted
      in
      foreign tax credits.

Income
      from Continuing Operations

Income
      from continuing operations was $218.4 million in 2004, compared with $175.2
      million in 2003. Results in both periods were affected by restructuring, gains
      on the sale of Thoratec shares and other items, discussed above.

Discontinued
      Operations

The
      company had after-tax gains of $100.5 million in 2004 and $27.3 million in
      from the disposal of discontinued operations.

The
      company’s discontinued operations (Spectra-Physics) had revenues through the
      date of sale of $118.9 million and $197.8 million in 2004 and 2003,
      respectively. Net income of the discontinued operations through the date of
      sale
      in 2004 was $4.5 million, net of a tax provision of $2.2 million. The company’s
      discontinued operations incurred a net loss in 2003 of $2.5 million, net of
      a
      tax benefit of $1.5 million. The improvement resulted from a rebound in the
      demand for lasers and photonics from microelectronics customers and other
      industrial markets served by Spectra-Physics. As a result of the decision to
      sell Spectra-Physics, a previously unrecognized tax asset arising from the
      difference between the book and tax basis of Spectra-Physics became realizable
      and the company recorded a tax benefit as income from discontinued operations
      totaling $38.5 million in 2004. In 2004, the company recorded a gain on the
      sale
      of Spectra-Physics of $45.9 million, net of a tax provision of $15.9
      million.

In
      2004,
      the company recorded a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $52.7
      million as a result of the settlement of tax audits of businesses previously
      sold.

In
      addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1.3 million of
      after-tax gains and $0.6 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued
      operations.

The
      gain consists of two pre-tax components and two tax components. In 2003, the
      company resolved several disputes and related claims that it had retained
      following the sale of businesses in its discontinued operations. In connection
      with the resolution of these matters on favorable terms relative to the damages
      estimated and amount of established reserves as well as the settlement of lease
      obligations, the company’s pre-tax gain recorded in prior years on disposal of
      the related businesses increased by $27.1 million. In 2003, the company also
      sold the last remaining business in discontinued operations, Peter Brotherhood
      Ltd., and received additional proceeds associated with businesses sold prior
      to
      2003, including post-closing purchase price adjustments. The company recorded
      pre-tax gains from the disposal of discontinued operations of $8.3 million,
      substantially as a result of these transactions. The company recorded a tax
      provision of $13.2 million on the above gains and realized $5.1 million of
      additional tax benefits from the disposal of businesses sold prior to 2003,
      principally foreign tax credits.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

Consolidated
      working capital was $562.2 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $890.9
      million at December 31, 2004. Included in working capital were cash, cash
      equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments of $295.0 million
      at
      December 31, 2005, compared with $512.3 million at December 31, 2004. The
      decreases result primarily from use of cash, cash equivalents, short-term
      available-for-sale investments and short-term debt to partially fund the Kendro
      acquisition.


Cash
      provided by operating activities was $270.9 million during 2005, including
      $272.8 million provided by continuing operations and $1.9 million used by
      discontinued operations. Cash of $24.3 million was provided by an increase
      in
      other current liabilities, primarily accrued payroll and benefits due to the
      timing of payments, and deferred revenue, pending completion of obligations
      to
      customers. Income tax payments of approximately $13 million arose from taxes
      on
      gains on the sale of investments. The company contributed $10.9 million of
      funding to a U.K. pension plan in June 2005 (Note 5). Payments for restructuring
      actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease
      costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $19.7
      million in 2005.

In
      connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations,
      the
      company had accrued $17.9 million for restructuring costs at December 31, 2005.
      The company expects to pay approximately $7.4 million of this amount for
      severance, primarily through 2006, and $1.3 million for other costs, primarily
      through 2006. The balance of $9.2 million will be paid for lease obligations
      over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 65% to be paid
      through 2006 and the remainder through 2011. In addition, at December 31, 2005,
      the company had accrued $6.3 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued
      acquisition expenses included $2.6 million of severance and relocation
      obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily through 2006. The
      remaining balance primarily represents abandoned-facility payments that will
      be
      paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2014.

During
      2005, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations,
      excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions and
      the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment. The company expended
      $933.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Niton, R&P,
      Kendro and Ionalytics (Note 2). The company expended $43.5 million for the
      purchases of property, plant and equipment and had proceeds from the sale of
      property, principally abandoned real estate, of $16.2 million. Investing
      activities of the company’s discontinued operations provided $65.6 million of
      cash in 2005, primarily from the sale of its point of care and rapid diagnostics
      business in September 2005 and the sale of a building of a previously divested
      business in August 2005.

The
      company’s financing activities provided $390.9 million of cash during 2005,
      principally from the issuance of $250 million senior notes due in 2015 and
      a net
      increase in short-term borrowings of $119.0 million. The company received net
      proceeds of $27.2 million from the exercise of employee stock options during
      2005. In February 2006, the company's Board of Directors authorized the
      repurchase of up to $100 million of the company's common stock through February
      28, 2007.

The
      company repaid in full $570 million of borrowings under its bridge loan with
      cash and proceeds of new debt issuances described below. In May 2005, the
      company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5% senior notes (the
      Notes) due 2015, with an effective interest rate of 5.27% after including the
      impact of an interest swap arrangement. Under the Notes’ Indenture, the company
      is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants.

Also
      in
      May 2005, the company entered into an arrangement that provides the company
      an
      uncommitted line of credit of up to $250 million through a series of short-term
      money market loans funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such
      money market loans have maturity periods of overnight to 364 days and bear
      varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate at the
      time
      of issuance. In May 2005, the company borrowed $250 million through three
      short-term loans under the money market arrangement with maturities of one
      week
      to three months. As of December 31, 2005, the company had repaid the borrowings
      under this arrangement.

In
      June
      2005, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a
      bank
      group that provides up to 175 million euros. The facility carries interest
      at a
      Euribor rate plus 35 basis points. Under the facility, borrowings of one to
      six
      months duration may be drawn. The agreement contains affirmative, negative
      and
      financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this
      type.
      The financial covenants include interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios.
      As
      of December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding borrowings under this facility
      of 105 million euros ($124 million) in two tranches with maturities in January
      2006 and with a weighted average interest rate of 2.47%. The company has
      refinanced the outstanding borrowings and intends to refinance future maturities
      with additional borrowings under the facility to the extent necessary for
      liquidity purposes.


Cash
      provided by operating activities was $264.5 million during 2004, including
      $250.0 million provided by continuing operations and $14.5 million provided
      by
      discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s
      continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses
      of
      real estate consolidation, used cash of $25.8 million in 2004. Accounts
      receivable increased $27.6 million due primarily to higher sales of mass
      spectrometry and informatics product offerings. Inventories increased $21.5
      million, due in part to increased production of mass spectrometry and
      spectroscopy instruments in response to higher demand for these products. Cash
      provided by discontinued operations of $14.5 million principally represents
      the
      positive cash flow of Spectra-Physics, offset in part by the payment of retained
      liabilities from businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of
      litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities.

During
      2004, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations,
      excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions for
      $143.0 million, net of cash acquired (Note 2) and the expenditure of $44.5
      million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, net of dispositions.
      Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $171.8 million of
      cash
      in 2004. In July 2004, the company sold Spectra-Physics to Newport Corporation
      for $300 million, including $200 million of initial cash proceeds. As a result
      of Newport assuming non-U.S. debt of Spectra-Physics that had earlier been
      expected to be retained by the company, and as a result of the post-closing
      adjustment process, the company refunded $25.1 million to Newport (Note
      16).

The
      company’s financing activities used $183.2 million of cash during 2004,
      including $183.7 million used by continuing operations. During 2004, the company
      expended $231.5 million to repurchase 8.4 million shares of the company’s common
      stock. The company received net proceeds of $57.6 million from the exercise
      of
      employee stock options during 2004.


Cash
      provided by operating activities was $214.7 million during 2003, including
      $200.3 million provided by continuing operations and $14.4 million provided
      by
      discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s
      continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses
      of
      real estate consolidation, used cash of $53.6 million in 2003. A decrease in
      inventories of $27.4 million resulted from efforts to improve working capital.
      Cash provided by discontinued operations of $14.4 million principally represents
      the positive cash flow of Spectra-Physics, offset in part by the payment of
      liabilities for businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of
      litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities.

During
      2003, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations,
      excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions,
      the
      purchase of property, plant and equipment and collection of a note receivable.
      The company expended $134.9 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions
      (Note 2). The company expended $37.4 million for purchases of property, plant
      and equipment, net of dispositions. In April and June 2003, the company received
      aggregate cash payments of $75.6 million, including $69.1 million of principal
      payments, plus interest, from Trimble Navigation Limited as complete and early
      payment of Trimble’s note to the company.

Quantitative
                  and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
                  Risk

The
      company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency
      exchange rates and equity prices, which could affect its future results of
      operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these
      risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally,
      the
      company uses short-term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to
      currencies. The company enters into forward currency-exchange contracts to
      hedge
      firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its
      subsidiaries’ local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive
      currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the company’s currency
      hedging activities is to protect the company’s local currency cash flows related
      to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The company’s
      forward currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated
      in euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling and Canadian dollars. Income
      and
      losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and
      income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does
      not
      enter into speculative currency agreements.

Interest
      Rates

Certain
      of the company’s short-term available-for-sale investments, long-term notes
      receivable and long-term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
      Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these
      financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate
      and
      the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A
      10%
      decrease in year-end 2005 and 2004 market interest rates would result in a
      net
      negative impact to the company of $9 million and $5 million, respectively,
      on the net fair value of its interest-sensitive financial
      instruments.

In
      addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s
      interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments. A 100-basis-point
      increase in 90-day LIBOR at December 31, 2005 and 2004, would increase the
      company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by $1 million. A 100-basis-point
      increase in 90 day Euribor at December 31, 2005 would increase the company’s
      annual pre-tax interest expense by $1 million.

Currency
      Exchange Rates

The
      company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional
      currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent. The company’s
      investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in
      currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s
      international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British pounds
      sterling and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates
      on
      the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the
“accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10%
      depreciation in year-end 2005 and 2004 functional currencies, relative to the
      U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $66 million
      and $106 million, respectively.

The
      fair
      value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency
      exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the
      estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of
      the
      contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10%
      appreciation in year-end 2005 and 2004 currency exchange rates related to the
      company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on
      forward currency-exchange contracts of $0.7 million and $5.9 million,
      respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange
      contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to
      approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.

Certain
      of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other
      than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes
      in
      currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2005 and
      2004 currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact of $2.7 million
      and $3.6 million, respectively, on the company’s net income.

Equity
      Prices

The
      company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes equity securities
      that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the company’s
      convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the
      company’s common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the
      fair value of the company’s available-for-sale investments and convertible
      obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the
      market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument.
      A
      10% decrease in year-end 2004 market equity prices would have resulted in a
      negative impact to the company of $10 million on the net fair value of its
      price-sensitive equity financial instruments, principally its available-for-sale
      investments. During 2005, the company sold substantially all of its
      available-for-sale equity investments (Note 4). A 10% increase in December
      31,
      2005 market equity prices would reduce the fair value of the company’s
      convertible obligations by $1 million.

Management’s
      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The
      company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive
      officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
      company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
      13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2005. Based on this evaluation,
      the
      company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as
      of December 31, 2005, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
      effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be
      disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the
      Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, reported and accumulated and
      communicated to the company’s management, including its chief executive officer
      and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
      required disclosure.

Management’s
      Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The
      company’s management, including the company’s chief executive officer and chief
      financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
      internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
      13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the company. Internal control over financial
      reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
      reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
      for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles. The company’s management conducted an assessment of the
      effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
      December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in “Internal Control -
      Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
      Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, the company’s management
      concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, the company’s internal control over
      financial reporting was effective.

REPORT
              OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
              FIRM

To
      the
      Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Thermo
      Electron Corporation:

We
      have
      completed integrated audits of Thermo Electron Corporation’s 2005 and 2004
      consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
      reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated
      financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits,
      are presented below.

Consolidated
      financial statements and financial statement schedule

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing
      under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
      position of Thermo Electron Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31,
      2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
      each
      of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
      addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
      appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
      information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
      consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial
      statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
      responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
      on
      our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
      the
      standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
      Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
      assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
      misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
      basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
      made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
      We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
      opinion.

Internal
      control over financial reporting

Also,
      in
      our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Annual Report on
      Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
      Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
      December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
      Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
      based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
      internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
      effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
      is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of
      the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
      conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
      with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
      States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
      reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
      reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control
      over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
      evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
      performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
      We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

REPORT

(Continued)

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
      to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
      (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
      necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
      of
      the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
      and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
      regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
      or
      disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
      financial statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

                  Policies

Nature
      of Operations

A
      world
      leader in high-tech instruments, Thermo Electron Corporation (the company)
      helps
      life science, laboratory and industrial customers advance scientific knowledge,
      enable drug discovery, improve manufacturing processes and protect people and
      the environment with instruments, scientific equipment, services and software
      solutions. The company’s powerful technologies help researchers make discoveries
      that will fight disease or prolong life. They automatically monitor and control
      online production to ensure the quality and safety of raw materials as well
      as
      the end products. And they are critical components embedded as enabling
      technologies within scientific and industrial devices.

Principles
      of Consolidation

The
      accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its
      wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
      transactions have been eliminated. The company accounts for investments in
      businesses in which it owns between 20% and 50% using the equity method.

Presentation

During
      2000 and 2001, the company completed the principal aspects of a major corporate
      reorganization. As part of this reorganization, the company spun off two
      businesses and sold a number of operating units which were treated as
      discontinued operations. In July 2004, the company sold Spectra-Physics, Inc.,
      its optical technologies segment. The results of operations and cash flows
      of
      Spectra-Physics have been classified as discontinued operations in the
      accompanying financial statements (Note 16). Certain reclassifications of prior
      year amounts have been made to conform to the current year
      presentation.

Revenue
      Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue
      is recognized after all significant obligations have been met, collectibility
      is
      probable and title has passed, which typically occurs upon shipment or
      completion of services. If customer-specific acceptance criteria exists, the
      company recognizes revenue after demonstrating adherence to the acceptance
      criteria. The company recognizes revenue and related costs for arrangements
      with
      multiple deliverables, such as equipment and installation, as each element
      is
      delivered or completed based upon its relative fair value. If fair value is
      not
      available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred
      until delivery is completed. When a portion of the customer’s payment is not due
      until installation or acceptance, the company defers that portion of the revenue
      until completion of installation or acceptance has been obtained. Revenues
      for
      training are deferred until the service is completed. Revenues for extended
      service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period.

The
      company’s informatics business recognizes revenue from the sale of software.
      License fee revenues relate primarily to sales of perpetual licenses to
      end-users and are recognized when a formal agreement exists, the license fee
      is
      fixed and determinable, delivery of the software has occurred and collection
      is
      probable. Software arrangements with customers often include multiple elements,
      including software products, maintenance and support. The company recognizes
      software license fees based on the residual method after all elements have
      either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair
      value
      exists for such undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for
      any
      undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is
      completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are
      recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, which is
      generally a period of one year. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance
      and
      support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support
      when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are
      recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by
      reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold
      separately.

Accounts
      receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The
      company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
      resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance
      for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable
      credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the
      allowance based on historical write-off experience. Past due balances are
      reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged off
      against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable
      will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit
      exposure related to customers.

Deferred
      revenue in the accompanying balance sheet consists primarily of unearned revenue
      on service contracts, which is recognized ratably over the terms of the
      contracts. Substantially all of the deferred revenue in the accompanying 2005
      balance sheet will be recognized within one year.

Warranty
      Obligations

The
      company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties, primarily from
      historical information, in cost of revenues at the time product revenue is
      recognized. While the company engages in extensive product quality programs
      and
      processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its
      component supplies, the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product
      failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs
      incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts
      delivered to the company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization
      levels, material usage, service delivery costs or supplier warranties on parts
      differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty
      liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included in other
      accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The changes in the carrying
      amount of warranty obligations are as follows (in thousands):

Stock-based
      Compensation Plans and Pro Forma Stock-based Compensation
      Expense

The
      company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting
      for Stock Issued to Employees” and related interpretations in accounting for its
      stock-based compensation plans (Note 5). Accordingly, no accounting recognition
      is given to stock options granted at fair market value until they are exercised.
      Upon exercise, net proceeds, including tax benefits realized, are credited
      to
      shareholders’ equity.

In
      October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation,” which sets forth a fair-value-based method of recognizing
      stock-based compensation expense. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the company
      has
      elected to continue to apply APB No. 25 to account for its stock-based
      compensation plans. Had compensation cost for awards granted after 1994 under
      the company’s stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair
      value at the grant dates consistent with the method set forth under SFAS No.
      123, and had the fair value of awards been amortized on a straight-line basis
      over the vesting period, the effect on certain financial information of the
      company would have been as follows:

                (continued)

The weighted average fair value per share of options granted was $9.04, $8.79
      and $6.73 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of each option
      grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
      model assuming an expected dividend yield of zero and with the following
      weighted-average assumptions:




Volatility

32%

31%

38%

Risk-free
                  Interest Rate

3.9%

4.6
                  years

4.4
                  years

The
      Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the
      fair
      value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
      transferable. In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly
      subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility. Because
      the
      company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different
      from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
      assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s
      opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
      measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

Income
      Taxes

In
      accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” the company
      recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences
      of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets
      and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
      in
      which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax
      return.

Earnings
      per Share

Basic
      earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted
      average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result
      would be antidilutive to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings
      per
      share has been computed assuming the conversion of convertible obligations
      and
      the elimination of the related interest expense, and the exercise of stock
      options, as well as their related income tax effects (Note 7).

Cash
      and Cash Equivalents

Cash
      equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper and
      other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three months
      or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market
      value.

Available-for-sale
      Investments

The
      company’s marketable equity and debt securities are considered
      available-for-sale investments in the accompanying balance sheet and are carried
      at market value, with the difference between cost and market value, net of
      related tax effects, recorded in the “Accumulated other comprehensive items”
component of shareholders’ equity

(Notes
      and 9). Decreases in market values of individual securities below cost for
      a
      duration of six to nine months are deemed indicative of other than temporary
      impairment, and the company assesses the need to write down the carrying amount
      of the investments to market value through other income, net, in the
      accompanying statement of income.

Inventories

Inventories
      are stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates the first-in,
      first-out basis) or net realizable value and include materials, labor and
      manufacturing overhead. The components of inventories are as

The
      company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences
      between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration
      usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information
      that
      is relevant to the judgment. The company records as a charge to cost of revenues
      any amounts required to reduce the carrying value of inventories to net
      realizable value.

Property,
      Plant and Equipment

The
      costs
      of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs
      are
      charged to expense as incurred. The company provides for depreciation and
      amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
      of
      the property as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery
      and equipment, 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of
      the term of the lease or the life of the asset. Property, plant and equipment

Acquisition-related
      Intangible Assets and Other Assets

Other
      assets in the accompanying balance sheet include deferred tax assets, notes
      receivable, cash surrender value of life insurance, deferred debt expense,
      other
      assets and, in 2004, shares of Newport Corporation common stock subject to
      long-term resale restrictions (Note 16). Acquisition-related intangible assets
      include the costs of acquired product technology, patents, trademarks and other
      specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using
      the
      straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 2
      to 20
      years. The company has no intangible assets with indefinite lives. The company
      reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential
      impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated
      with
      the assets. Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows:

Goodwill

The
      company assesses the realizability of goodwill annually and whenever events
      or
      changes in circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Such events or
      circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a
      significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company’s
      reporting units. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units
      by
      using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. When an impairment is
      indicated, any excess of carrying value over fair value of goodwill is recorded
      as an operating loss.

The
      company completed annual tests for impairment at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      and
      determined that goodwill was not impaired.

The
      changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as

Forward
      Contracts

T

he
      company accounts for forward currency contracts under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133, as amended,
      requires that all derivatives, including forward currency-exchange contracts,
      be
      recognized in the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges
      must be recorded at fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge,
      depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
      derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
      item
      through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
      item is recognized in earnings. The company immediately records in earnings
      the
      extent to which a hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in
      fair
      value or cash flows.

The
      company uses forward currency-exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain
      operational (cash-flow hedges) and balance sheet (fair-value hedges) exposures
      resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from
      purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies
      other
      than the functional currencies of the respective operations. These contracts
      principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British
      pounds sterling and Canadian dollars. The company enters into these
      currency-exchange contracts to hedge anticipated product purchases and sales
      and
      assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business, principally
      accounts receivable and intercompany loans. Accordingly, the hedges are not
      speculative in nature. As part of the company’s overall strategy to manage the
      level of exposure to the risk of currency-exchange fluctuations, some operating
      units hedge a portion of their currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing
      12-month period, using exchange contracts that have maturities of 12 months
      or
      less. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative
      instruments for purposes other than risk management.

The
      company records its forward currency-exchange contracts at fair value in its
      balance sheet as other current assets or other accrued expenses and, for
      cash-flow hedges, the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred
      as
      a component of accumulated other comprehensive items in the accompanying balance
      sheet. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in earnings in the period
      in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. Unrealized gains and
      losses resulting from the impact of currency exchange rate movements on
      fair-value hedges are recognized in earnings in the period in which the exchange
      rates change and offset the currency losses and gains on the underlying exposure
      being hedged. Cash flows resulting from currency-exchange contracts qualifying
      as cash-flow hedges are recorded in the accompanying statement of cash flows
      in
      the same category as the item being hedged. At December 31, 2005, the company
      did not have any deferred gains or losses relating to forward currency-exchange
      contracts. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on derivative instruments
      is recorded in other income, net, in the accompanying statement of income and
      is
      not material for the three years presented.

The
      company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in 2005 in connection
      with
      debt issued for the Kendro acquisition (Note 10).

Recent
      Accounting Pronouncements

In
      June
      2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 143-1, “Accounting for Electronic Equipment
      Waste Obligations” to address the accounting for obligations associated with EU
      Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. The directive
      requires EU member countries to adopt legislation to regulate the collection,
      treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and
      electronic waste equipment. Under the directive, the waste management obligation
      for historical equipment (products put on the market on or prior to August
      13,
      2005) remains with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced.
      Depending upon the law adopted by the particular country, upon replacement,
      the
      waste management obligation for that equipment may be transferred to the
      producer of the related equipment. The user retains the obligation if they
      do
      not replace the equipment. FSP No. FAS 143-1 requires a commercial user to
      apply
      the provisions

of
      SFAS
      No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and related FASB
      Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”
to waste obligations associated with historical equipment. The rules require
      that a liability be established for the retirement obligation with an offsetting
      increase to the carrying amount of the related asset. FSP No. FAS 143-1 is
      effective the later of the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005
      or
      the date of adoption of the law by the applicable EU member country. The
      issuance of FSP No. FAS 143-1 is not expected to have a material impact on
      the
      company’s financial statements.

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No.
      123(R) amends SFAS No. 123 to require that companies record as expense the
      effect of equity-based compensation, including stock options, over the
      applicable vesting period. The company currently discloses the effect on income
      that stock options would have were they recorded as expense. SFAS No. 123(R)
      also requires more extensive disclosures concerning stock options than required
      under current standards. The new rule applies to option grants made after
      adoption as well as options that are not vested at the date of adoption. SFAS
      No. 123(R) becomes effective in 2006. The company will apply the new standard
      using the modified prospective method in the first quarter of 2006. If the
      company had adopted this standard in 2005, the company’s net income for 2005
      would have been $13.6 million (or $.08 per diluted share) lower than reported
      in
      2005.

In
      November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs - an amendment of
      ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” which is the result of its efforts to converge U.S.
      accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards.
      SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
      handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) to be recognized as current-period
      charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to
      the
      costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
      facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during
      2006. The company does not expect adoption of this standard will have a material
      effect on its financial statements.

Use
      of Estimates

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
      accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
      that
      affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
      assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
      amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In addition,
      significant estimates were made in estimating future cash flows to quantify
      impairment of assets, and in determining the ultimate loss from abandoning
      leases at facilities being exited (Note 15). Actual results could differ from
      those estimates.

Acquisitions

In
      August
      2005, the company’s Life and Laboratory Sciences segment acquired Ionalytics
      Corporation, a Canada-based provider of a dynamic ion-filtering device used
      with
      mass spectrometers in bioanalysis, proteomics and drug discovery for $24.7
      million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of Ionalytics enabled the segment
      to broaden its mass spectrometry product offerings. Ionalytics did not have
      material revenues in 2004 as its focus was on commercially introducing its
      principal product to market. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of
      the
      acquired net assets and, accordingly, $6.8 million was allocated to goodwill,
      all of which is tax deductible.

Acquisitions
                  and Dispositions
                  (continued)

In May 2005, the company’s Life and Laboratory Sciences segment acquired the
      Kendro Laboratory Products division of SPX Corporation for $836.6 million,
      net
      of cash acquired, including transaction costs. Kendro designs, manufactures,
      markets and services, on a global basis, a wide range of laboratory equipment
      for sample preparation, processing and storage, used primarily in life sciences
      and drug discovery laboratories as well as clinical laboratories. The
      acquisition of Kendro broadened the segment’s product offerings and access to
      customers. Kendro’s revenues were $371 million in 2004. The purchase price
      exceeded the fair value of the acquired assets and, accordingly, $465.0 million
      was allocated to goodwill, approximately $185 million of which is expected
      to be
      tax deductible.

The
      company obtained short-term bridge financing, which permitted it to borrow
      $570
      million to partially fund the purchase price of Kendro. The company used
      existing cash balances to fund the remainder of the purchase price.
      Subsequently, the company used a combination of short- and long-term debt
      instruments to refinance the bridge loan (Note 10).

In
      April
      2005, the company’s Measurement and Control segment completed the acquisition of
      Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P), a New York-based provider of
      continuous particulate monitoring instrumentation for the ambient air, emissions
      monitoring and industrial hygiene markets for $31.0 million in cash, net of
      cash
      acquired. The acquisition of R&P enabled the segment to broaden its air
      monitoring product offerings. R&P’s revenues totaled $17 million in 2004.
      The agreement calls for additional consideration of up to $3 million through
      2007 based on achieving targeted sales levels and payment of 7% of specified
      product sales thereafter through 2009. The purchase price exceeded the fair
      value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $15.5 million was allocated
      to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In
      March
      2005, the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment acquired Niton LLC, a
      Massachusetts-based provider of portable X-ray analyzers to the metals,
      petrochemical and environmental markets for $40.9 million in cash, net of cash
      acquired. Of the total purchase price, $40.0 million was paid on the closing
      date and the balance was paid in June 2005, following determination of the
      post-closing adjustment. The agreement under which the company acquired Niton
      calls for additional contingent consideration of up to $2.0 million through
      based on post-acquisition results, of which $1.0 million was earned and accrued
      at December 31, 2005, through an increase to goodwill. The acquisition of Niton
      enabled the segment to expand its X-ray products to include a portable line.
      Niton’s revenues in 2004 totaled $36 million. The purchase price exceeded the
      fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $16.4 million was
      allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.

In
      September 2004, the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment broadened its
      informatics offerings by acquiring InnaPhase Corporation, a Pennsylvania-based
      supplier of laboratory information management systems for the pharmaceutical
      and
      biotechnology markets, for $64.7 million, net of cash acquired. In February
      the company received a post-closing adjustment of $0.5 million as a refund
      of
      part of the purchase price. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the
      acquired net assets and, accordingly, $39.8 million was allocated to goodwill,
      none of which is tax deductible. InnaPhase had revenues of $17.7 million in
      2004, prior to it being acquired.

In
      April
      2004, the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment expanded its service capabilities
      by acquiring US Counseling Services, Inc. (USCS), a Wisconsin-based supplier
      of
      equipment asset management services to the pharmaceutical, healthcare and
      related industries, for $74.7 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price
      exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $54.2
      million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible. USCS reported
      revenues of $57 million in 2003.

In
      addition, in September 2004 the Measurement and Control segment acquired a
      manufacturer and distributor of air quality instruments in China for $3.7
      million in cash.

Acquisitions
                  and Dispositions
                  (continued)

On
      December 31, 2003, the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment acquired Jouan
      SA
      for 110.9 million euros in cash ($137.8 million, or $122.7 million, net of
      cash
      acquired) and the assumption of approximately 11.8 million euros of debt ($14.7
      million). Jouan is a global supplier of products used by life science
      researchers in academic, pharmaceutical, biotech and clinical markets to prepare
      and preserve laboratory samples and has broadened the company’s offerings in
      these markets. Having completed the acquisition of Jouan at the close of
      business on the last day of the company’s fiscal year, no results of operations
      or cash flows prior to 2004 have been included in the accompanying financial
      statements. During the first quarter of 2004, the company determined the fair
      value of Jouan’s identifiable intangible assets and completed the purchase price
      allocation. As a result, $34.9 million was reclassified from goodwill to
      acquired intangible assets in 2004. In addition, the company recorded a deferred
      tax liability of $12.1 million related to these assets, with a corresponding
      increase in goodwill. After these adjustments, goodwill arising from the Jouan
      acquisition totaled $77.1 million, none of which is tax deductible.

In
      2003,
      in addition to the acquisition of Jouan, the company made four other
      acquisitions for $12.3 million in cash, net of cash acquired.

In
      2004,
      the company recorded a reduction in goodwill of $40.5 million related to use
      or
      expected use of tax attributes of businesses acquired in 2002 and prior
      years.

The
      company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the fair
      value of the acquired assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of
      synergies of combining the businesses. These synergies include use of the
      company’s existing infrastructure such as sales force, distribution channels and
      customer relations to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; use of
      the infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost effectively expand sales
      of company products; and elimination of duplicative facilities, functions and
      staffing.

These
      acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting,
      and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying
      financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Allocation
      of
      the purchase price for acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value
      of
      the net assets acquired and, for acquisitions completed in 2005, is subject
      to
      adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The company
      has
      gathered no information that indicates the final purchase price allocations
      will
      differ materially from the preliminary estimates although for Kendro, the
      company expects to finalize an asset appraisal in Germany and complete its
      rationalization plans for certain product lines, headcount and facilities in
      the
      first quarter of 2006.

Had
      the
      acquisition of Kendro been completed as of the beginning of 2004, the company’s

      The

The
      company has undertaken restructuring activities at acquired businesses. These
      activities, which were accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue No. 95-3,
      “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination,”
have primarily included reductions in staffing levels and the abandonment of
      excess facilities. In connection with these restructuring activities, as part
      of
      the cost of acquisitions, the company established reserves as detailed below,
      primarily for severance and excess facilities. In accordance with EITF Issue
      No.
      95-3, the company finalizes its restructuring plans no later than one year
      from
      the respective dates of the acquisitions. Upon finalization of restructuring
      plans or settlement of obligations for less than the expected amount, any excess
      reserves are reversed with a corresponding decrease in goodwill or other
      intangible assets when no goodwill exists. Accrued acquisition expenses are
      included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet.

The
      principal acquisition expenses for pre-2005 acquisitions were for severance
      for
      approximately 1,038 employees across all functions and for abandoned facilities,
      primarily related to the company’s acquisitions of Life Sciences International
      PLC in 1997, the product-monitoring businesses of Graseby Limited in 1998,
      Spectra-Physics AB in 1999 and Jouan in 2003. The abandoned facilities for
      the
      1997 and 1998 acquisitions include three operating facilities in England with
      leases expiring through 2014. In some instances, the facilities are subleased
      but certain restoration obligations are payable at the end of the lease. The
      amounts accrued for abandoned facilities also include closure of a Jouan
      manufacturing facility in Denmark, with a lease expiring in 2007. In 2004 and
      2005, the company

reached
        favorable settlements of lease obligations for several abandoned sites and
        recorded the benefit as a reduction of goodwill. The amounts captioned as
        “other” primarily represent employee relocation, contract termination and other
        exit costs.

Acquisitions
                  and Dispositions
                  (continued)

Dispositions

The
      company sold its point of care and rapid diagnostics business in 2005 and
      Spectra-Physics in 2004 (Note 16). The company sold a non-core business for
      net
      cash proceeds of $5.7 million in 2005 and several non-core businesses for net
      cash proceeds of $16.4 million in 2003 and recorded $0.3 million of pre-tax
      gains in 2005 and $4.7 million of pre-tax losses in 2003, which are included
      in
      restructuring and other costs, net, in the accompanying statement of
      income.

In
      2000,
      the company’s Measurement and Control segment sold its Spectra Precision
      businesses to Trimble Navigation Limited. As part of the sale proceeds, the
      company obtained an $80.0 million note from Trimble, which carried interest
      at
      10%. Trimble and the company negotiated a change in the note’s terms in March
      2002. Under the revised terms, Trimble paid $11 million of principal, together
      with $10 million of accrued interest. The amended note carried an interest
      rate
      of 10.41% and under certain conditions allowed the interest to be added to
      the
      note’s principal. In addition, the company obtained warrants to purchase shares
      of Trimble, which became exercisable at various times and prices depending
      on
      the outstanding balance of the note. The warrants were recorded at their fair
      value. During 2003, Trimble repaid the note in full and the company sold all
      of
      the warrants that it had obtained from Trimble. The company recorded a gain
      of
      $1.2 million on the sale of the warrants as other income in the accompanying
      2003 statement of income.

Note
                3.

Business
                Segment and Geographical
                Information

The
      company’s businesses are managed in two segments:

The
      Life
      and Laboratory Sciences segment serves the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and
      other research and industrial laboratory markets, as well as scientists in
      government and academia, with advanced instrument systems and software that
      enable discovery, R&D and quality assurance. The segment also serves the
      healthcare market with equipment, laboratory-automation systems and consumables
      for pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government and clinical
      customers.

The
      Measurement and Control segment enables customers in key industrial markets,
      such as chemical, oil and gas, semiconductor, pharmaceutical, food and beverage,
      minerals and mining, and steel, to control and optimize their manufacturing
      processes. The segment provides analytical tools, online process instruments
      and
      precision temperature-control systems that are used to increase quality, improve
      productivity and meet environmental and other regulatory standards. The segment
      also offers a comprehensive range of chemical-, radiation- and
      explosives-detection instruments.

Business
      segment information captioned as Other in the following tables represents
      results of a unit that marketed and manufactured molecular beam epitaxy
      equipment. The unit was part of the company’s former Optical Technologies
      segment and was sold in 2003. Results after 2003 primarily represent revisions
      to estimates of abandoned lease obligations, net of subtenant
      rents.

The
      company’s management evaluates operating segment performance based on a measure
      that is not determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
      principles, adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is segment
      operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues, principally
      associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income
      including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and
      abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and
      product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The
      company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate
      the segment’s core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance
      for determining compensation.

In
      July
      2004, the company received 3,220,000 shares of Newport Corporation common stock
      upon the sale of Spectra-Physics to Newport. In June 2005, the company reached
      an agreement with Newport under which Newport purchased all of the 3,220,000
      shares of Newport common stock. Newport purchased the shares for $13.56 per
      share, which resulted in aggregate proceeds of $43.7 million. The company
      recorded a loss on the sale of $1.3 million. The Newport shares had been subject
      to resale restrictions that would have fully lapsed by January
      2006.

As
      a
      result of the divestiture of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001, the company
      acquired shares of Thoratec Corporation. The company sold 4,436,000, 1,250,000
      and 2,000,000 shares of Thoratec common stock during 2005, 2004 and 2003 and
      realized gains of $28.9 million, $9.6 million and $16.3 million, respectively.
      At December 31, 2005, the company no longer owned shares of
      Thoratec.

The
      company acquired 4,162,000 shares of FLIR Systems, Inc. common stock in
      connection with a business acquired in 1999. The company sold 334,175 shares
      of
      FLIR common stock during 2003 and realized gains of $13.7 million. These gains
      included $3.9 million from the recovery of amounts written down in prior years
      when the company deemed an impairment of its investment in FLIR to be other
      than
      temporary. At December 31, 2003, the company no longer owned shares of
      FLIR.

Gain
      on
      investments, net, also includes portfolio gains from the company’s day-to-day
      investing activities. In addition to gains from the sale of available-for-sale
      investments, $1.5 million of gains arose in 2005 from the sale of investments
      that had been classified as Other Assets.

Employee
                  Benefit Plans

Stock-based
      Compensation Plans

Stock
      Option Plans

The
      company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors
      and
      others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based
      awards, including restricted stock, stock options, stock bonus shares or
      performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the
      company’s Board of Directors (the Board Committee) or in limited circumstances,
      by the company’s option committee, which consists of its chief executive
      officer. Generally, options granted prior to July 2000 under these plans are
      exercisable immediately, but shares acquired upon exercise are subject to
      certain transfer restrictions and the right of the company to repurchase the
      shares at the exercise price upon certain events, primarily termination of
      employment. The restrictions and repurchase rights lapse over periods ranging
      from 0-10 years, depending on the term of the option, which may range from
      3-12
      years. Options granted in or after July 2000 under these plans generally vest
      over three to five years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions.
      Upon a change in control of the company, all options, regardless of grant date,
      become immediately exercisable and shares acquired upon exercise cease to be
      subject to transfer restrictions and the company’s repurchase rights.
      Nonqualified options are generally granted at fair market value. Incentive
      stock
      options must be granted at not less than the fair market value of the company’s
      stock on the date of grant. The company also has a directors’ stock option plan
      that provides for the annual grant of stock options of the company to outside
      directors. Options awarded under this plan prior to 2003 are immediately
      exercisable and expire three to seven years after the date of grant. Options
      awarded in 2003 and thereafter vest over three years, assuming continued service
      on the board, and expire seven years after the date of grant.

In
      2005,
      2004 and 2003, the company awarded to a number of key employees 146,000, 60,000
      and 75,000 shares, respectively, of restricted company common stock or
      restricted units that convert into an equivalent number of shares of common
      stock assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. The awards had an
      aggregate value of $4.1 million, $1.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively.
      The awards generally vest in equal annual installments over two to three years,
      assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. The company recorded $2.8
      million, $1.8 million and $2.6 million of compensation expense related to these
      awards in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

A
      summary
      of the status of the company’s stock options at December 31, 2005, is as
      follows:

Employee
      Stock Purchase Plans

Qualifying
      employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan
      sponsored by the company. Under this program, through 2005 shares of the
      company’s common stock could be purchased at 85% of the lower of the fair market
      value at the beginning or end of the purchase period, and the shares purchased
      were subject to a one-year resale restriction. Shares are purchased through
      payroll deductions of up to 10% of each participating employee’s gross wages. In
      early 2006, 2005 and 2004, the company issued 115,000, 136,000 and 185,000
      shares, respectively, of its common stock for the 2005, 2004 and 2003 plan
      years, which ended on December 31. Beginning in 2006, shares may be purchased
      under the program at 95% of the fair market value at the end of the purchase
      period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding
      period.

The
      company had a plan in England under which employees could purchase shares of
      the
      company’s common stock through payroll deductions. No material issuances
      occurred in 2003 or 2004 under the plan. Following the issuance of 30,000 shares
      under the plan in 2005, the plan was discontinued.

401(k)
      Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans

The
      company’s 401(k) savings plan covers the majority of the company’s eligible
      full-time U.S. employees. Contributions to the plan are made by both the
      employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of
      employee contributions.

Certain
      of the company’s subsidiaries offer retirement plans in lieu of participation in
      the company’s principal 401(k) savings plan. Company contributions to these
      plans are based on formulas determined by the company.

For
      these
      plans, the company contributed and charged to expense $22.2 million, $17.7
      million and $16.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Several

During
      the second quarter of 2005, the company merged two defined benefit plans in
      the
      U.K. and provided the participating employees with a defined contribution plan
      while limiting future benefits under the combined defined benefit plan. The
      transaction met the criteria of a plan curtailment although no gain or loss
      resulted. In connection with the transaction, the company contributed $10.9
      million to the combined U.K. defined benefit plan. Subsequently, the company
      modified a retirement benefit obligation under the merged plan to conform to
      U.K. law and recorded a charge of $4.1 million for the cost of the
      change.

In determining the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations, the
        company references indicies for long-term, high-quality corporate bonds and
        uses
        a discount rate that does not exceed the yield reported for those indicies
        after
        adjustment for the duration of the plans’ liabilities.

In
      determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company
      considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance
      of
      total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators

      $42.6 million of the company’s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax
      assets for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce goodwill
      of an acquired business.

Income
                Taxes (continued)

During
      2004 and early 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the company reached
      a final settlement of the audit of the company’s tax returns for the 1998
      through 2000 tax years. In addition, in 2004, audits of state tax returns were
      completed. In 2004, the company recorded tax benefits that had not previously
      been recognized of $33.8 million in continuing operations and $52.7 million
      in
      discontinued operations (Note 16) associated with the completion of the tax
      audits.

In
      addition to the tax benefit of $52.7 million, discussed above, the company’s tax
      benefit from discontinued operations in 2004 included amounts pertaining to
      Spectra-Physics (Note 16).

At
      December 31, 2005, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating
      loss carryforwards of $63 million, $1.3 billion and $188 million, respectively.
      Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain
      subsidiaries. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire
      in
      the years 2006 through 2021. Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards,
      $18 million expire in the years 2006 through 2014, and the remainder do not
      expire. The company also had $61 million of federal foreign tax credit
      carryforwards as of December 31, 2005, which expire in the years 2006 through
      2014.

A
      provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $711
      million of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could
      be
      subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because the company plans to keep
      these amounts permanently reinvested overseas except for instances where the
      company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax
      cost.

      2003, respectively, because the options’ exercise prices were greater than the
      average market price for the common stock and their effect would have been

      assuming the conversion of the company’s 4 3/8% subordinated convertible
      debentures convertible at $111.83 per share because the effect would be

The
      cost
      of available-for-sale investments that were sold was based on specific
      identification in determining realized gains and losses recorded in the
      accompanying statement of income. The net gain on the sale of available-for-sale
      investments resulted from gross realized gains of $35.1 million, $21.0 million
      and $38.2 million, and gross realized losses of $1.3 million, $0.2 million
      and
      $2.7 million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The sole investment with
      an
      unrealized loss at December 31, 2004, was the portion of the company’s
      investment in Newport common stock held as an available-for-sale security.
      The
      fair value of the Newport shares increased in early 2005 such that it
      approximated the company’s cost.

The
      company’s investments in auction rate securities are recorded at cost, which
      approximates fair value due to their variable interest rates. The interest
      rates
      generally reset every 7 to 28 days. Despite the long-term nature of their stated
      contractual maturities,

all
      of
      which are over 10 years, the company has the ability to quickly liquidate
      investments in auction rate securities. All income generated from these
      investments has been recorded as interest income.

See
      Note
      13 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term
      obligations.

Short-term
      obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying
      balance sheet included $128.5 million and $13.1 million at year-end 2005 and
      2004, respectively, of short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines
      of
      credit of certain of the company’s subsidiaries. The borrowings outstanding at
      year-end 2005 include amounts under the company’s euro facility, described
      below. The weighted average interest rate for these borrowings was 2.4% and
      1.4%
      at year-end 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition to available borrowings
      under the company’s five-year U.S. dollar and euro revolving credit agreements
      and a money market loan fund arrangement, all discussed below, the company
      had
      unused lines of credit of $188.4 million as of year-end 2005. These unused
      lines
      of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various
      interest rates.

In
      December 2002, the company entered into revolving credit agreements, as amended,
      with a bank group that provided for up to $250 million of unsecured borrowings.
      The arrangement was replaced in December 2004 with a 5-year revolving credit
      agreement. The agreement provides for a $250 million revolving credit facility
      that will expire in December 2009. The agreement calls for interest at either
      a
      LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate

of
      the
      agent bank, at the company’s option. The rate at December 31, 2005, was 5.10%
      under the more favorable of the two rates. The agreement contains affirmative,
      negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings
      of this type. The financial covenants include interest coverage and
      debt-to-capital ratios. At December 31, 2005, no borrowings were outstanding.
      The credit agreement permits the company to use the facility for working
      capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other
      securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate
      purposes.

Long-term
                  Obligations and Other Financing
                  Arrangements (continued)

In June 2005, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility
      with a bank group that provides up to 175 million euros. The facility carries
      interest at a Euribor rate plus 35 basis points. Under the facility, borrowings
      of one to six months duration may be drawn. The agreement contains affirmative,
      negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings
      of this type. The financial covenants include interest coverage and
      debt-to-capital ratios. As of December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding
      borrowings under this facility of 105 million euros ($124 million) in two
      tranches with maturities in January 2006. The company has refinanced the
      outstanding borrowings and intends to refinance future maturities with
      additional borrowings under the facility to the extent necessary for liquidity
      purposes.

In
      May
      2005, the company entered into an arrangement that provides the company an
      uncommitted line of credit of up to $250 million until May 26, 2006 through
      a
      series of short-term money market loans funded on an ongoing basis in the
      secondary market. Such money market loans have maturity periods of overnight
      to
      364 days and bear varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and
      market rate at the time of issuance. In May 2005, the company borrowed $250
      million through three short-term loans under the money market arrangement with
      maturities of one week to three months. As of December 31, 2005, the company
      had
      repaid these borrowings and had no balance outstanding.

During
      2002, the company entered into interest-rate swap arrangements for its $128.7
      million principal amount 7 5/8% senior notes, due in 2008, with the
      objective of reducing interest costs. The arrangements provide that the company
      will receive a fixed interest rate of 7 5/8%, and will pay a variable rate
      of 90-day LIBOR plus 2.19% (6.83%

as
      of
      December 31, 2005). The swaps have terms expiring at the maturity of the debt.
      The swaps are designated as fair-value hedges and as such, are carried at fair
      value, which resulted in an increase in both other long-term assets and
      long-term debt of $1.8 million and $6.5 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively. The swap arrangements are with different counterparties than
      the
      holders of the underlying debt. Management believes that any credit risk
      associated with the swaps is remote based on the creditworthiness of the
      financial institutions issuing the swaps.

In
      May
      2005, in connection with plans to refinance a portion of the amounts borrowed
      under the bridge facility for the Kendro acquisition (Note 2), the company
      entered into forward starting pay fixed swap agreements with several banks
      to
      mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt
      offering. Based on the company’s conclusion that a debt offering was probable
      and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year
      term, the swaps hedge the cash flow risk that exists on each of the semi-annual
      fixed-rate interest payments on $250 million of principal amount of the 10-year
      fixed-rate debt issue (or any subsequent refinancing of such debt). The change
      in the fair value of the hedge, $2.0 million, net of tax, was classified as
      a
      reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholders’ equity
      and is being amortized to interest costs over the term of the debt through
      2015.

The
      company repaid in full $570 million of borrowings under its bridge loan with
      cash and proceeds of new debt issuances described above. In May 2005, the
      company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5% senior notes (the
      Notes) due 2015, with an effective interest rate of 5.27% after including the
      impact of the swap arrangement. Under the Notes’ Indenture, the company is
      subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants.

In
      2003,
      the company redeemed the convertible debentures discussed below with the
      objective of reducing interest expense. The redemption price was 100% of the
      principal amount of the debentures plus accrued interest. In 2003, the company
      redeemed all of its outstanding 4 3/8% subordinated convertible debentures
      due
      2004 and 4% subordinated convertible debentures due 2005. The principal amounts
      redeemed for the 4 3/8% and 4% debentures were $70.9 million and $197.1 million,
      respectively. Redemptions and repurchases of subordinated convertible debentures
      resulted in a charge of $1.0 million in 2003 in the accompanying statement
      of
      income.

Commitments
                  and
                  Contingencies

Operating
      Leases

The
      company leases portions of its office and operating facilities under various
      operating lease arrangements. Income from continuing operations includes expense
      from operating leases of $4

6.5
      million, $40.3 million and $35.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
      Future minimum payments due under noncancellable operating leases at December
      31, 2005, are $39.5 million in 2006, $30.1 million in 2007, $22.6 million in
      2008, $16.7 million in 2009, $13.7 million in 2010 and $70.0 million in 2011
      and
      thereafter. Total future minimum lease payments are $192.6 million.

Purchase
      Obligations

At
      December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding noncancellable purchase
      obligations, principally for inventory purchases, totaling $82.8 million,
      substantially all of which will be settled in 2006.

Letters
      of Credit and Guarantees

Outstanding
      letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $38.2 million at December 31,
      2005, including $3.2 million for businesses that have been sold. The expiration
      of these credits and guarantees ranges through 2013.

Outstanding
      surety bonds totaled $14.2 million at December 31, 2005, including $10.8 million
      for businesses that have been sold. The expiration of these bonds ranges through
      2010 for existing businesses and primarily through 2011 for businesses that
      have
      been sold.

The
      letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure
      performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face
      amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable
      business unit does not perform as contractually required. With respect to
      letters of credit, guarantees and surety bonds that were issued for businesses
      that were sold, the buyer is obligated to indemnify the company in the event
      such letters of credit and/or surety bonds are drawn.

In
      connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed
      certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify
      the company with respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third
      party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations
      or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the
      company could be liable to the third party for such obligations. However, in
      such event, the company would be entitled to indemnification by the
      buyer.

Indemnifications

In
      conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company
      has
      agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities
      related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were
      abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product
      liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from
      transaction to transaction. Where appropriate, an obligation for such
      indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a maximum obligation
      cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities
      at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant
      payments for these indemnifications.

Commitments
                and Contingencies
                (continued)

In
      connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it
      occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them
      to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third party, it
      remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner
      of
      the facility. As a result, if a third party vacates the sublet facility, the
      company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master
      lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default by
      sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s
      financial position or results of operations.

In
      connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the
      company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its
      products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and
      agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement.
      The company has not been required to make material payments under such
      provisions.

Litigation
      and Related Contingencies

On
      September 3, 2004, Applera Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS
      Scientific Instruments filed a lawsuit against the company in U.S. federal
      court. These plaintiffs allege that the company’s mass spectrometer systems,
      including its triple quadrupole and certain of its ion trap systems, infringe
      a
      patent of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs seek damages, including treble damages
      for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest and
      injunctive relief.

Chromagen,
      Inc. has brought an arbitration proceeding against the company alleging that
      it
      owes Chromagen up to approximately $30 million for failure to timely develop
      and
      commercialize a new product utilizing Chromagen scanning fluorescence detection
      technology. The company has filed a counterclaim in the same proceeding
      alleging that, among other things, Chromagen breached its obligation to provide
      the company with the specified technology. The case is expected to be heard
      by a
      panel of arbitrators in March

2006.

In
      the
      opinion of management, an unfavorable outcome of either or both of these matters
      could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well
      as its results of operations and cash flows.

On
      December 8, 2004 and February 23, 2005, the company asserted in two lawsuits
      against a combination of Applera Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied
      Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments that one or more of these parties infringe
      two patents of the company.

The
      company’s continuing and discontinued operations are a defendant in a number of
      other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations.
      The
      company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually
      or
      in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position,
      results of operations, or cash flows.

Common
                  and Preferred Stock

At
      December 31, 2005, the company had reserved 25,350,285 unissued shares of its
      common stock for possible issuance under stock-based compensation plans and
      for
      possible conversion of the company’s convertible debentures.

The
      company has 50,000 shares of authorized but unissued $100 par value preferred
      stock.

The
      company has distributed rights under a shareholder rights plan adopted by the
      company’s Board of Directors to holders of outstanding shares of the company’s
      common stock. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one one
      hundred-thousandth of a share (a Unit) of Series B Junior Participating
      Preferred Stock, $100 par value, at a purchase price of $200 per Unit, subject
      to adjustment. The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i)
      business days following a public announcement that a person or group of
      affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person) has acquired, or obtained
      the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding
      shares of common stock (the Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii) 10 business days
      following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more
      of the outstanding shares of common stock.

In
      the
      event that a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the
      outstanding shares of common stock, except pursuant to an offer for all
      outstanding shares of common stock that at least 75% of the Board of Directors
      determines to be fair to, and otherwise in the best interests of, stockholders,
      each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) will thereafter have
      the right to receive, upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock
      (or,
      in certain circumstances, units of preferred stock, cash, property or other
      securities of the company) which equals the exercise price of the right divided
      by one-half of the current market price of the common stock. In the event that,
      at any time after any person has become an Acquiring Person, (i) the
      company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction in
      which the company is not the surviving corporation or its common stock is
      changed or exchanged (other than a merger that follows an offer approved by
      the
      Board of Directors), or (ii) 50% or more of the company’s assets or earning
      power is sold or transferred, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring
      Person) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, the number
      of
      shares of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the exercise price
      of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of such common
      stock.

At
      any
      time until the Stock Acquisition Date, the company may redeem the rights in
      whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right (payable in cash or stock).
      The rights expire on September 29, 2015, unless earlier redeemed or
      exchanged.

Fair
                  Value of Financial
                  Instruments

The company’s financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents,
      short-term available-for-sale investments, accounts receivable, notes
      receivable, short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term
      obligations, accounts payable, long-term obligations and forward
      currency-exchange contracts.

Available-for-sale
      investments are carried at fair value in the accompanying balance sheet. The
      fair values were determined based on quoted market prices (Note 9).

The
      carrying amount and fair value of the company’s notes receivable, long-term
      obligations and forward currency-exchange contracts are as follows:

The
      fair
      value of the notes receivable (principally the note receivable from Newport)
      was
      determined based on borrowing rates available to companies of comparable credit
      worthiness at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The
      fair
      value of the investment in Newport common stock subject to long-term resale
      restrictions was determined using a quoted fair market value.

The
      fair
      value of long-term obligations was determined based on quoted market prices
      and
      on borrowing rates available to the company at the respective year ends.

The
      notional amounts of forward currency-exchange contracts outstanding totaled
      $94.8 million and $60.4 million at year-end 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
      fair value of such contracts is the estimated amount that the company would
      receive upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in
      currency exchange rates.

Restructuring
                  and Other Costs, Net

In
      response to a downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with
      the company’s overall reorganization, restructuring actions were initiated in
      2003, and to a lesser extent, 2004 in a number of business units to reduce
      costs
      and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation
      of
      facilities. Restructuring and other costs recorded in 2005 are primarily for
      reductions in staffing levels at existing businesses resulting from the
      integration of Kendro and the consolidation of two facilities in Texas. The
      costs also include charges associated with actions initiated prior to 2005
      that
      could not be recorded until incurred and adjustments to previously provided
      reserves due to changes in estimates of sub-tenant rentals from abandoned
      facilities. The company expects to incur an additional $2 million of costs
      that
      cannot be recorded until incurred, primarily in 2006. The restructuring actions
      undertaken in 2003 and 2004 were substantially complete at the end of 2004.
      The
      company is continuing to evaluate potential restructuring actions that may
      be
      undertaken at Kendro or within existing businesses with which Kendro is being
      integrated. Such actions may include rationalization of product lines,
      consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels. The cost of
      actions at Kendro businesses is being charged to the cost of the acquisition
      while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with Kendro
      is
      charged to expense. While the company has not finalized its plans for
      integrating Kendro with its existing business, it expects that charges to
      expense will ultimately total $15 - $20 million, of which approximately $8
      million has been recorded as of December 31, 2005.

      company recorded net restructuring and other costs by segment for 2005 as

Restructuring
                  and Other Costs, Net
                  (continued)

The
      components of net restructuring and other costs by segment are as
      follows:

Life
      and Laboratory Sciences

The
      Life
      and Laboratory Sciences segment recorded $17.9 million of net restructuring
      and
      other charges in 2005. The segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of
      $12.4
      million, for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and
      $5.5 million of other costs, net. These other costs consisted of $11.6 million
      of

cash
      costs, principally associated with the integration of Kendro with existing
      businesses, including $9.2 million of severance for 151 employees across all
      functions

;
      $1.6
      million of abandoned-facility costs, primarily for charges associated with
      facilities vacated in prior periods where estimates of sub-tenant rental income
      have changed; and $0.8 million of other cash costs, primarily retention and
      relocation expenses associated with facility consolidations. These severance
      and
      other cash costs were net of reversals of $0.1 million, principally due to
      lower
      costs resulting from employee attrition. In addition, the segment recorded
      charges of $1.7 million primarily for the writedown to estimated disposal value
      of a building in France held for sale. These costs were offset by gains of
      $7.8
      million from the sale of six abandoned buildings.

Measurement
      and Control

The
      Measurement and Control segment recorded $10.9 million of net restructuring
      and
      other charges in 2005. The segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of
      $1.0
      million, consisting of $0.5 million for accelerated depreciation at facilities
      closing due to real estate consolidation and $0.5 million for the sale of
      inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; and $9.9 million of other
      costs, net. These other costs consisted of $10.2 million of cash costs,
      including $4.6 million of severance for 98 employees across all functions;
      $4.4
      million of abandoned-facility costs, primarily for charges associated with
      facilities vacated in prior periods where estimates of sub-tenant rental income
      have changed and for the 2005 consolidation of two operating facilities in
      Texas; and $1.2 million of other cash costs, primarily retention and relocation
      expenses. These severance, facility and other cash costs were net of reversals
      of $0.6 million, principally due to lower costs resulting from employee
      attrition. In addition, the segment recorded a gain of $0.3 million on the
      sale
      of a small U.K. non-core business for cash proceeds of $5.7
      million.

Other

The
      company reversed previously established reserves of $0.6 million in 2005 as
      a
      result of revising its estimate of lease obligations due to sub-leasing an
      abandoned facility of a divested business.

Corporate

The
      company recorded $2.1 million of restructuring and other charges at its U.S.
      and
      European administrative offices in 2005, all of which were cash costs. These
      cash costs were primarily for severance for 18 employees.


Restructuring
      and other costs recorded in 2004 include charges associated with new actions
      and
      actions initiated prior to 2004 that could not be recorded until incurred.
      These
      charges totaled $19.2 million and are detailed by segment below.

Life
      and Laboratory Sciences

The
      Life
      and Laboratory Sciences segment recorded $10.2 million of net restructuring
      and
      other charges in 2004. The segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of
      $3.2
      million, consisting of $2.1 million for the sale of inventories revalued at
      the
      date of acquisition of Jouan, and $1.1 million of accelerated depreciation
      on
      fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations; and $7.0 million
      of
      other costs. These other costs consisted of $8.6 million of cash costs,
      including $5.1 million of severance for 181 employees across all
      functions

;
      $2.8
      million of abandoned- facility costs, primarily for charges associated with
      facilities vacated in prior periods where estimates of sub-tenant rental income
      have changed or for costs that could not be recorded until incurred; and $0.7
      million of other cash costs, primarily relocation expenses. These severance
      and
      other cash costs were net of reversals of $0.6 million, principally due to
      lower
      costs resulting from employee attrition. In addition, the segment recorded
      charges of $1.0 million, primarily for abandoned equipment and the sale of
      two
      abandoned buildings. These costs were offset by a gain of $2.6 million on the
      sale of a product line.

Measurement
      and Control

The
      Measurement and Control segment recorded $6.5 million of net restructuring
      and
      other charges in 2004. The segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of
      $0.2
      million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; and
      $6.3 million of other costs. These other costs consisted of $6.2 million of
      cash
      costs, including $3.8 million of severance for 106 employees across all
      functions; $1.9 million of abandoned-facility costs, primarily for charges
      associated with facilities vacated in prior periods where estimates of
      sub-tenant rental income have changed or for costs that could not be recorded
      until incurred; and $0.5 million of other cash costs, primarily relocation
      expenses. These severance, facility and other cash costs were net of reversals
      of $0.7 million, principally due to lower costs resulting from employee
      attrition. In addition, the segment recorded charges of $0.1 million, primarily
      for equipment at an abandoned facility.

Corporate

The
      company recorded $2.3 million of restructuring and other charges at its U.S.
      and
      European administrative offices in 2004, all of which were cash costs. These
      cash costs included $1.3 million of severance; $0.7 million of third-party
      advisory fees; and $0.3 million of abandoned-facility costs. While the company
      no longer has any public subsidiaries, it has numerous non-U.S. subsidiaries
      through which the formerly public subsidiaries conducted business. The
      third-party advisory fees were incurred to simplify this legal structure. The
      principal aspects of this project were completed in 2004.

Restructuring
                  and Other Costs, Net
                  (continued)


In
      response to a continued downturn in markets served by the company and in
      connection with the company’s overall reorganization, restructuring actions were
      initiated in 2003 in a number of business units to reduce costs and
      redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of
      facilities. These charges totaled $45.3 million and are detailed by segment
      below.

The components of net restructuring and other costs by segment are as
      follows:

Life
      and Laboratory Sciences

The
      Life
      and Laboratory Sciences segment recorded $21.8 million of net restructuring
      and
      other charges in 2003. These charges included $18.8 million of cash costs,
      principally associated with facility consolidations, including $9.8 million
      of
      severance for 415 employees across all functions; $4.2 million of ongoing lease
      costs through 2006 for abandoned facilities described below; $1.5 million of
      employee-retention costs; and $3.3 million of other cash costs, primarily
      relocation expenses. The charges for severance are net of reversals of $1.5
      million that the segment had provided prior to 2003 and were not required,
      primarily due to employee attrition. The charges for abandoned facilities
      included the consolidation of four manufacturing facilities in the United
      States; the closure of a manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom, the
      activities of which were transferred to a facility in the United States;
      consolidation of distribution facilities in Japan; and revised estimates of
      future lease costs for facilities in Europe that the segment provided prior
      to
      2003. These charges are net of reversals of $1.0 million, which represents
      revised estimates of future lease costs for facilities that the segment
      abandoned prior to 2003. In addition, the segment recorded net charges of $3.4
      million, principally to write down the carrying value of fixed assets, primarily
      buildings held for sale, to estimated disposal value. These charges were offset
      by $0.4 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of a product
      line.

Measurement
      and Control

The
      Measurement and Control segment recorded $10.3 million of net restructuring
      and
      other charges in 2003. The segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of
      $0.1
      million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of
      acquisition

;
      and
      $10.2 million of other costs. These other costs consisted of $10.3 million
      of
      cash costs, principally associated with facility consolidations, including
      $6.8
      million of severance for 164 employees across all functions; $0.9 million of
      ongoing lease costs through 2007 for abandoned facilities described below;
      $0.3
      million of employee-retention costs; and $2.3 million of other cash costs,
      primarily relocation expenses. The charges for severance are net of reversals
      of
      $1.5 million that the segment had provided prior to 2003 and were not required,
      primarily due to a change in the restructuring plan and employee attrition.
      The
      charges for abandoned facilities included the closure of sales offices in The
      Netherlands and France, the activities of which were transferred to other

facilities
      in the region, and the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in
      Massachusetts and Wisconsin. These charges are net of reversals of $0.4 million,
      which represent revised estimates of future lease costs for facilities that
      the
      segment abandoned prior to 2003. In addition, the segment recorded a gain of
      $2.1 million on the sale of a building in Germany, offset by net charges of
      $2.0
      million, primarily for the writedown of goodwill related to the segment’s test
      and measurement business to reduce the carrying value of the business to
      disposal value. The test and measurement business was sold in October
      2003.

The
      company’s other businesses (previously included in the Optical Technologies
      segment) recorded $8.1 million of restructuring costs in 2003. The costs
      included a charge of $4.8 million for the writedown to disposal value of a
      non-core product line that was sold in October 2003. The company also recorded
      $2.2 million of lease costs for the closure of a manufacturing facility in
      the
      United Kingdom relating to the sale of the product line discussed above; $0.7
      million of severance for 20 employees; and $0.4 million of employee retention
      and other cash costs.

Corporate

The
      company recorded $5.1 million of restructuring and other charges at its
      corporate offices in 2003, all of which were cash costs. These cash costs
      included $2.6 million for third-party advisory fees; $1.0 million of ongoing
      lease costs through 2006 for abandoned facilities described below; $0.9 million
      of severance for 16 employees in administrative functions; and $0.6 million
      of
      relocation expenses. The third-party advisory fees were incurred to simplify
      the
      legal structure of the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries. The charges for
      abandoned facilities and relocation expenses are for the consolidation of three
      administrative offices in Europe.

Employee-retention
                costs are accrued ratably over the period through which employees
                must
                work to qualify for a payment. The pre-2002 awards were based on
                specified
                percentages of employees’ salaries and were generally awarded to help
                ensure continued employment at least through completion of the company’s
                reorganization plan.

(b)

Represents
                reductions in cost of plans as described in the discussion of
                restructuring actions by segment.

(c)

Balance
                of accrued restructuring costs for severance from 2000 plans related
                to
                pension liability associated with employees terminated in 2000, which
                was
                transferred to accrued pension costs in
                2003.

(d)

Excludes
                noncash charges, net, of $3.0 million in the Life and Laboratory
                Sciences
                segment and $4.9 million at the company’s other businesses; and net gains
                of $0.1 million, primarily from the sale of a building, offset by
                a
                writedown to disposal value of a business sold in October 2003, in
                the
                Measurement and Control segment.

(e)

Excludes
                noncash charges, net, of $1.0 million and $0.1 million in the Life
                and
                Laboratory Sciences and Measurement and Control segments, respectively;
                other income, net, of $2.6 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences
                segment; and $0.1 million of other income, net in the company’s other
                businesses.

(f)

Excludes
      net gains of $7.8 million from the sale of six abandoned buildings and noncash
      charges of $1.7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and a gain
      of $0.3 million from the sale of a small non-core business in the Measurement
      and Control segment.

The
      company expects to pay accrued restructuring costs as follows: severance,
      employee-retention obligations and other costs, which principally consist of
      cancellation/termination fees, primarily through 2006; and abandoned-facility
      payments, over lease terms expiring through 2011.

Discontinued
                  Operations

During
      2004, the company’s discontinued operations (principally Spectra-Physics) had
      revenues and net income of $118.9 million and $4.5 million, respectively. In
      addition, the company recorded a $38.5 million tax benefit related to
      Spectra-Physics, described below. During 2003, the company’s discontinued
      operations had revenues and a net loss of $197.8 million and $2.5 million,
      respectively. Liabilities of discontinued operations principally represent
      remaining obligations of the discontinued businesses including litigation,
      severance and lease obligations.

In
      2005,
      the company recorded after-tax gains of $24.9 million from the disposal of
      discontinued operations. In September 2005, the Life and Laboratory Sciences
      segment sold its point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53.1 million
      in cash after determining it was not a strategic fit in the long-term. The
      company recorded an after-tax gain of $16.8 million as a result of the sale.
      Revenues and pre-tax loss of the divested business totaled $29.7 million and
      $0.7 million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre-tax income totaled
      $26.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale.
      Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative
      to
      consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results
      and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In August 2005, the
      company sold a building of a previously divested business for net proceeds
      of
      $7.3 million in cash, which approximated its carrying value. In
      addition,

the
      company recorded after-tax gains of $8.1 million from the disposal of
      discontinued operations. The gains represent additional proceeds from the sale
      of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real
      estate and post-closing adjustments, settlement of litigation and an arbitration
      award related to divested businesses.

Spectra-Physics

In
      July
      2004, the company sold its Optical Technologies segment, Spectra-Physics, to
      Newport for initial consideration of $300 million, subject to a post-closing
      balance sheet adjustment. As a result of Newport assuming non-U.S. debt of
      Spectra-Physics that had earlier been expected to be retained by the company
      and
      as a result of the post-closing adjustment process, the company paid $25.1
      million to Newport, making the net selling price approximately $275 million.
      The
      company sold this operating unit to focus on its core businesses that provide
      analytical instrumentation to laboratory and industrial customers. The net
      selling price of $275 million exceeded Spectra-Physics’ book value and was
      comprised of $175 million in cash; a 5% note in the principal amount of $50
      million, due in 2009; and $50 million in Newport common stock, with the number
      of issued shares determined based on the 20-trading day average price prior
      to
      closing. The fair value of the note and Newport common stock at the date of
      closing aggregated approximately $90 million. The note receivable from Newport
      is classified as noncurrent other assets in the accompanying balance sheet.
      Under the terms of the agreement, the company had agreed to certain restrictions
      on the sale of the Newport shares it received in this transaction, however,
      this
      restriction was subsequently removed and as of December 31, 2005, the company
      no
      longer owned shares of Newport common stock. The company retained a small
      manufacturing unit in New York.

As
      a
      result of the decision to sell Spectra-Physics, a previously unrecognized tax
      asset arising from the difference between the book and tax basis of
      Spectra-Physics became realizable and the company recorded a tax benefit as
      income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million in 2004. In addition,
      the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra-Physics of $45.9 million,
      net
      of a tax provision of $15.9 million.

Other

In
      January 2000, the company announced its intention to sell several of its
      businesses, including its power-generation business and its Trex Medical and
      ThermoLase units. The company classified these businesses as discontinued
      operations.

Discontinued
                  Operations
                  (continued)

The
      tax
      returns of the company and its former Trex Medical and ThermoLase businesses
      were under audit by the IRS. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company
      reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that
      previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the divested businesses
      totaling $52.7 million were realizable. These tax benefits were recorded as
      a
      gain on disposal of discontinued operations in 2004.

In
      addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1.3 million of
      after-tax gains and $0.6 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued
      operations.

The
      company had after-tax gains of $27.3 million in 2003 from the disposal of
      discontinued operations. The gain consisted of two pre-tax components and two
      tax components. In 2003, the company resolved several disputes and related
      claims that it had retained following the sale of businesses in its discontinued
      operations. In connection with the resolution of these matters on favorable
      terms relative to the damages estimated and amount of established reserves
      as
      well as the settlement of lease obligations, the company’s pre-tax gain recorded
      in prior years on disposal of the related businesses increased by $27.1 million.
      In 2003, the company also sold the last remaining business in discontinued
      operations, Peter Brotherhood Ltd., and received additional proceeds associated
      with businesses sold prior to 2003, including post-closing purchase price
      adjustments. The company recorded pre-tax gains on disposal of discontinued
      operations of $8.3 million, substantially as a result of these transactions.
      The
      company recorded a tax provision of $13.2 million on the above gains and
      realized $5.1 million of additional tax benefits from the disposal of businesses
      sold prior to 2003, principally foreign tax credits.
