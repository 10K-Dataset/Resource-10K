There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital.

Dependency on a Single Customer

There is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. No customer accounted for more than 5% of our total revenues in any of the past three years.

Government Contracts

Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results.

Competition

The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors. Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success primarily depends on the following factors:

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.

In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Business (continued)

A

number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures.

Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State’s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island.

We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $32 million at December 31, 2014.

These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Regulatory Affairs

Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.

Financial Statement Index



THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Business (continued)

We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.

Number of Employees

We have approximately 51,000 employees.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 4.

We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.

Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.

Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.

It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.

Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:

Financial Statement Index



THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Risk Factors (continued)

We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.

Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.

Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of:

Financial Statement Index



THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Risk Factors (continued)

Integrating the Life Technologies businesses into Thermo Fisher’s existing businesses may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be fully realized.

The success of the acquisition of Life Technologies, including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of Thermo Fisher and Life Technologies. The integration may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or that the alignment of standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in the markets in which Life Technologies operated prior to closing, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our common stock. Other potential difficulties of combining the business of Thermo Fisher and Life Technologies include unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information communications and other systems.

If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. Integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the company.

As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.

International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2013, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $36 million on the revenues of our continuing operations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services, and in 2014, currency translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $60 million. For 2015, the company is expecting a significant negative impact on revenues and operating income due to the stronger U.S. dollar.

Healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could have an adverse impact on us. Some of the potential consequences, such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services.

Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.

We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.

Overview

The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 3): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services.

Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures

The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as its 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.

On February 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation for a total purchase price of $15.30 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $2.28 billion of debt. The company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition discussed below under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. Life Technologies was integrated into the Life Sciences Solutions segment and provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing. Life Technologies’ revenues totaled $3.87 billion in 2013.

On March 21, 2014, the company sold its legacy sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare for $1.06 billion, net of cash divested. The sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $761 million included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. The businesses fell principally in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies acquisition. Revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately $250 million and $64 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $61 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.

On August 15, 2014, the company sold its Cole-Parmer specialty channel business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment, for $480 million in cash, net of cash divested. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $134 million, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. Revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately $232 million and $43 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $149 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)

The company expects its effective tax rate in 2015 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business.

Income from continuing operations increased to $1.90 billion in 2014, from $1.28 billion in 2013. The increase in operating income in the 2014 period (discussed above) was offset in part by an increase in the income tax provision in the 2014 period (discussed above) and an increase in interest expense of $218 million as a result of debt issued and assumed in connection with the acquisition of Life Technologies.

During 2014, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $2.62 billion compared with $2.01 billion for 2013. The increase resulted from cash flow from the acquired Life Technologies operations and a lower investment in working capital items, principally due to income tax refunds and the timing of tax payments, offset in part by cash disbursements totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, including severance obligations, third-party transaction/integration costs and monetizing certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition.

As of December 31, 2014, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.21 billion, including $1.21 billion of senior notes, due in the first half of 2015 and $1.00 billion of minimum payments due in the next twelve months on the company’s term loan. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. In February 2015, the maximum capacity of this facility was increased from $1.50 billion to $2.00 billion. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $59 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.

The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.35 billion as of December 31, 2014 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Sales in 2014 were $16.89 billion, an increase of $3.80 billion from 2013. Sales increased $3.31 billion due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $60 million in 2014. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $549 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. Demand from biopharma customers remained strong. Sales to customers in healthcare and industrial markets grew moderately while sales to academic and government markets grew modestly in 2014. Sales growth was strong in Europe and moderate in North America and Asia. Revenues and operating income of the company’s non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars to report consolidated results. Based on weakening of currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar that occurred in late 2014 and early 2015, the company currently expects that there will be a significant adverse effect on reported amounts of revenues and operating income in 2015 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar.

In 2014, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, compared with $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, in 2013. The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses, inclusion of Life Technologies’ results from the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by $450 million of charges associated with the acquisition, as discussed below, as well as $569 million of higher amortization expenses, also primarily related to the acquisition. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.

In 2014, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements. The company incurred $268 million of cash restructuring costs primarily associated with the Life Technologies acquisition including cash compensation to monetize certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition and severance obligations to former executives and employees of Life Technologies. In addition, the company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia (see Note 14).

Financial Statement Index



THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations (continued)

In 2013, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $180 million, including $29 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $74 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, changes in estimates of contingent consideration for an acquisition and a charge associated with product liability litigation. The company incurred $78 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that were being consolidated. The cash costs also included $4 million of transaction expenses related to the agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses (see Note 2).

As of February 26, 2015, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $70 million in 2015 and expects to identify additional actions during 2015 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as abandonment of leased facilities. Approximately half of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, with the remainder incurred across the company’s remaining segments. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2014 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $120 million beginning in part in 2014 and, to a greater extent, in 2015, including $80 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2013 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2013 and to a greater extent in 2014, including $5 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $30 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

Segment Results

The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $3.48 billion to $4.20 billion in 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of Life Technologies, net of divestitures. Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed at the beginning of 2013, pro forma revenues for the 2014 period would have decreased $38 million compared to pro forma 2013 revenues, including a decrease of $151 million due to dispositions, net of other acquisitions and a decrease of $45 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by an increase of $158 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for biosciences and bioprocess production products, offset in part by lower licensing revenues.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations (continued)

Operating income margin was 29.0% in 2014 compared to 23.8% in 2013. The increase resulted primarily from higher operating margins in Life Technologies’ businesses relative to the segment’s legacy operations and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. The company expects the segment’s operating income margin in the first quarter of 2015 will be lower than the 29.3% reported in the first quarter of 2014. This is due to excluding the results of Life Technologies prior to the February 3, 2014 acquisition date. Results for January commonly have a lower margin rate than results for the balance of the quarter, due to the phasing of revenue and costs.

Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $98 million to $3.25 billion in 2014. Sales increased $113 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $15 million due to acquisitions, offset in part by a decrease of $30 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments and, to a lesser extent, environmental instruments. These increases were offset in part by modestly lower sales of chemical analysis products due primarily to softness in certain commodity markets such as minerals.

Operating income margin was 17.9% in 2014 compared to 17.7% in 2013. The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit from favorable sales mix. The increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments.

The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for immunodiagnostics products, products sold through the segment’s healthcare market channel and, to a lesser extent, clinical diagnostics products.

Operating income margin was 27.4% in 2014 and 27.1% in 2013. The increase resulted primarily from favorable sales mix and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $203 million to $6.60 billion in 2014. Sales increased $312 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase was offset in part by a decrease of $93 million due to dispositions and $17 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for laboratory products and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial logistics services.

Operating income margin was 14.9% in 2014 and 15.0% in 2013. The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.

Other Expense, Net

The company reported other expense, net, of $416 million and $290 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense increased $218 million primarily due to the debt issued and assumed in connection with the acquisition of Life Technologies. In 2014, the company realized net gains of $9 million from equity and available-for-sale investments. In 2013, the company recorded $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. Also in 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million.

Provision for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rates were 9.2% and 3.1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 provision for income taxes includes $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. Aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014. The federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20.1 million, or 1.0 percentage point. In 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15.4 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $586 million and $230 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate in both periods was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The U.S. Congress has not extended the tax credit for research and development activities in 2015 as of February 26, 2015.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations (continued)

In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress’ renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S. The federal tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points. The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements.

The company expects its effective tax rate in 2015 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business.

The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. All of these countries except one have a lower tax rate than the U.S. The countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the U.S. include Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.

Discontinued Operations

In June 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, the company pursued a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The company completed the sale in October 2012 for nominal proceeds. In 2013, the company recorded an after-tax charge of $4.2 million for the estimated cost to raze certain abandoned facilities of the discontinued operations prior to the planned sale of the land.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify income statement classification by removing the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP. As a result, items that are both unusual and infrequent will no longer be separately reported net of tax after continuing operations. The company adopted this guidance effective January 2015. The adoption of this standard in 2015 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for the company in 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The company is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations will be presented as discontinued operations. The new guidance also requires disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of the company that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The company adopted this guidance effective January 2015. The adoption of this standard in 2015 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

Sales in 2013 were $13.09 billion, an increase of $580 million from 2012. Sales increased $188 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $36 million in 2013. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $429 million (3%) primarily due to increased demand offset in part by modestly lower sales to customers in academic and government markets which the company believes was due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. Sales remained strong to customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries while sales growth was modest to customers in industrial markets. Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America.

In 2013, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, compared with $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, in 2012. The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions. The increase was offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, $24 million of higher acquisition-related charges in 2013, an increase in amortization expense of $16 million in 2013 primarily related to the acquisitions of One Lambda and Doe & Ingalls and imposition of a medical device excise tax in 2013.

In 2013, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $180 million, including $29 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $74 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, revisions of estimated contingent consideration for an acquisition and a charge associated with product liability litigation. The company incurred $78 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the consolidation of several facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 14). The cash costs also included $4 million of transaction expenses related to the agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses (see Note 2).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations (continued)

In 2012, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $150 million, including $56 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $13 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of transaction costs related to the acquisition of One Lambda. The company incurred $67 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible asset at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, real estate writedowns related to facility consolidations partially offset by a $6 million gain from the settlement of pre-acquisition litigation.

The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2012 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $85 million beginning in part in 2012 and to a greater extent in 2013, including $10 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $30 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

Results of Operations (continued)

Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 7% to $2.55 billion in 2013 due primarily to productivity improvements, net of inflationary costs increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions, offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.

Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $54 million to $713 million in 2013. Sales increased $55 million (8%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses offset in part by a decrease of $1 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for bioscience products.

Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $40 million to $3.15 billion in 2013. Sales increased $53 million (2%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $9 million due to acquisitions. These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $23 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments, offset in part by lower sales of chemical analysis products which the company believes were affected by macro economic conditions facing customers in industrial markets.

Operating income margin was 17.7% in 2013 compared to 17.8% in 2012. Operating margin was unfavorably affected by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign currency exchange, offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.

Sales increased $143 million due to an acquisition and $93 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $5 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand, particularly for clinical diagnostics products and, to a lesser extent, microbiology and allergy products in part as a result of strong flu and pollen seasons, partially offset by weakness from reduced healthcare utilization and lower sales of instruments to diagnostic laboratories due in part to lower healthcare reimbursement rates in the U.S. for anatomical pathology tests.

Operating income margin was 27.1% in 2013 and 25.6% in 2012. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales from an acquisition and, to a lesser extent, at existing businesses as well as productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. The increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and imposition of the medical device excise tax in 2013.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $296 million to $6.40 billion in 2013. Sales increased $266 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $36 million due to an acquisition. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $6 million in 2013. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for laboratory products and clinical trial logistics services. Sales of laboratory equipment increased only modestly due to weakness in demand from customers in academic and government markets.

Operating income margin was 15.0% in both 2013 and 2012. Productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, price increases were offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.

Other Expense, Net

The company reported other expense, net, of $290 million and $213 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively (Note 4). In the first quarter of 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million. In 2013, other items, net also includes $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the Life Technologies Acquisition, offset in part by gains totaling $5 million from sales of equity investments. Interest expense increased $21 million primarily due to the debt issued to fund the One Lambda and Life Technologies acquisitions.

Provision for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rates were 3.1% and 0.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $230 million and $331 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Tax payments decreased in 2013 due primarily to refunds of taxes paid in 2012. In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress’ renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S. The tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points. The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements. The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden.

Results of Operations (continued)

Discontinued Operations

The company completed the sale of its laboratory workstations business in October 2012 for nominal proceeds. The business was included in the Laboratory Products and Services segment prior to being reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in June 2012. Revenues of the laboratory workstations business were $147 million in the 2012 period prior to the sale. The business incurred a pre-tax loss of $30 million in 2012 in part due to inventory write-offs, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring and other transition costs associated with relocation of the business. In 2012, the company recorded after-tax charges aggregating $63 million as the loss on the divestiture. The loss in 2013 for discontinued operations primarily represents a charge for the cost of razing abandoned facilities of the business prior to sale of the land.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Consolidated working capital was $1.19 billion at December 31, 2014, compared with $6.75 billion at December 31, 2013. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.35 billion at December 31, 2014 and $5.83 billion at December 31, 2013. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to the cash used to fund the Life Technologies acquisition and an increase in short-term debt of $1.2 billion, also principally due to the acquisition.


Cash provided by operating activities was $2.62 billion during 2014, primarily from the company’s earnings. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $145 million and $110 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Other assets decreased by $163 million primarily due to collection of tax refunds including those related to legacy Life Technologies’ operations. Other liabilities increased by $308 million primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. In 2014, the company made cash payments including severance obligations, third-party transaction/integration costs and monetizing certain equity awards totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $50 million during 2014. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $586 million during 2014, compared with $230 million in 2013, in part due to taxes on the gains from the sale of businesses.

During 2014, the company’s investing activities used $11.78 billion of cash, principally for the acquisition of Life Technologies. Acquisitions used cash of $13.06 billion. Proceeds from the sale of businesses provided $1.52 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $428 million of property, plant and equipment. In February 2015, the company completed an acquisition for approximately $300 million in cash (Note 17).

The company’s financing activities provided $4.80 billion of cash during 2014. To partially fund the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company borrowed $5.00 billion under an unsecured term loan (Note 9) and issued 34.9 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $2.94 billion in cash (Note 11). Other long-term borrowings totaled $1.59 billion. Repayments of long-term debt, principally the term loan, totaled $4.43 billion. A decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $250 million. The company’s financing activities also included $155 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the payment of $235 million in cash dividends. On November 8, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.00 billion of the company’s common stock beginning January 1, 2013. At December 31, 2014, $910 million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. In the first quarter of 2015 through February 26, 2015, the company repurchased $500 million of its common stock under this authorization. In February 2015, the company notified holders of its 5.00% Senior Notes due June 2015 that it will redeem all $250 million principal amount outstanding on March 6, 2015.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

As of December 31, 2014, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.21 billion, including $1.21 billion of senior notes, due in the first half of 2015 and $1.00 billion of minimum payments due in the next twelve months on the company’s term loan. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. In February 2015, the maximum capacity of this facility was increased from $1.50 billion to $2.00 billion. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $59 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.

Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. foreign tax credit equals or exceeds any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future.

The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.35 billion as of December 31, 2014 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.


Cash provided by operating activities was $2.01 billion during 2013, primarily from the company’s earnings. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $148 million and $72 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. A decrease in other assets provided cash of $169 million primarily due to timing of income tax refunds. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $47 million, primarily due to higher inventory purchases. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $163 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. In the 2013, the company paid fees to obtain bridge financing commitments and other transaction costs totaling $108 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $38 million during 2013. Cash payments for income taxes of continuing operations totaled $230 million. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $69 million during 2013.

During 2013, the company’s primary investing activity was the purchase of $282 million of property, plant and equipment.

The company’s financing activities provided $3.31 billion of cash during 2013. To partially fund the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company issued $3.20 billion of senior notes. The company’s financing activities also included the receipt of $230 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the repurchase of $90 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $216 million in cash dividends.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)


Cash provided by operating activities was $2.04 billion during 2012, primarily from the company’s earnings. An increase in inventories used cash of $60 million, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $100 million primarily related to the timing of tax refunds. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $127 million, primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes of continuing operations totaled $331 million during 2012. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $64 million during 2012.

During 2012, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $1.08 billion for acquisitions and $315 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s investing activities also included a $45 million increase in restricted cash to collateralize short-term borrowings in Asia. The company’s discontinued operations provided $59 million of cash, primarily tax benefits from the loss on sale of the laboratory workstations business and receipt of escrowed proceeds from the 2011 sale of Lancaster Laboratories.

The company’s financing activities used $918 million of cash during 2012, principally for the repurchase of $1.15 billion of the company’s common stock and to reduce commercial paper obligations by $849 million, offset in part by the issuance of $1.3 billion in senior notes. The company’s financing activities in 2012 also included the repayment of $355 million of long-term debt and the receipt of $254 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Cash dividend payments totaled $142 million during 2012.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2012 - 2014 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, a build-to-suit lease arrangement entered in 2012, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $32.1 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2014 was $49 million.

In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.

The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen, Norwegian kroner and Swedish kronor. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.

Interest Rates

The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2014, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2014 was $14.89 billion (see Note 12). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2014 would increase by approximately $683 million. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2014 would decrease by approximately $629 million.

In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including a term loan agreement and swap arrangements. In 2014, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the term loan and swap arrangements would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $35 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued)

Currency Exchange Rates

The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Danish kroner and Canadian dollars. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2014 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $1.04 billion.

The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2014 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $110 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2014 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $110 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.

Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2014 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $23 million on the company’s net income.

Controls and Procedures

Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management, including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, the company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, as stated in their report that appears on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To

the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing at Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.            Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by providing analytical instruments, equipment, reagents and consumables, software and services for research, manufacturing, analysis, discovery and diagnostics. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, universities, research institutions and government agencies, as well as environmental and industrial process control settings. On February 3, 2014, the company acquired Life Technologies Corporation (Note 2).

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company accounts for investments in businesses using the equity method when it has significant influence but not control (generally between

20% and

50% ownership) and is not the primary beneficiary.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue is recognized after all significant obligations have been met, collectability is probable and title has passed, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery or completion of services. If customer-specific acceptance criteria exist, the company recognizes revenue after demonstrating adherence to the acceptance criteria. The company recognizes revenue and related costs for arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as equipment and installation, as each element is delivered or completed based upon its relative fair value. When a portion of the customer’s payment is not due until installation or other deliverable occurs, the company defers that portion of the revenue until completion of installation or transfer of the deliverable. Provisions for discounts, warranties, rebates to customers, returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales taxes, value-added taxes and certain excise taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenue.

T

he company recognizes revenue from the sale of software. License fee revenues relate primarily to sales of perpetual licenses to end-users and are recognized when a formal agreement exists, the license fee is fixed and determinable, delivery of the software has occurred and collection is probable. Software arrangements with customers often include multiple elements, including software products, maintenance and support. The company recognizes software license fees based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for such undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, which is generally a period of one year. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately.

Royalty revenue is recognized when the amounts are earned and determinable during the applicable period based on historical activity. For those arrangements where royalties cannot be reasonably estimated, revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash or royalty statements from licensees.

Service revenues represent the company’s service offerings including clinical trial logistics, asset management, diagnostic testing, training, service contracts, and field service including related time and materials. Service revenues are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues for service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers.

The company records shipping and handling charges billed to customers in net sales and records shipping and handling costs in cost of product revenues for all periods presented.

Deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet consists primarily of unearned revenue on service contracts, which is recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts. Substantially all of the deferred revenue in the accompanying 2014 balance sheet will be recognized within one year.

Warranty Obligations

The company provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of product revenues at the time product revenue is recognized. While the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs or supplier warranties on parts differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Extended warranty agreements are considered service contracts which are discussed above. Costs of service contracts are recognized as incurred. The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows:

Research and Development

The company conducts research and development activities to increase its depth of capabilities in technologies, software and services. Research and development costs include employee compensation and benefits, consultants, facilities related costs, material costs, depreciation and travel. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

The company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return.

The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money (Note 7).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share has been computed using the treasury stock method for the equity forward agreements and outstanding stock options and restricted units, as well as their related income tax effects (Note 8).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

Investments

The company’s marketable equity and debt securities that are part of its cash management activities are considered short-term investments in the accompanying balance sheet. In addition, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, the company owned $8.7 million and $14.3 million, respectively, of marketable equity and debt securities that represent less than

20% ownership and for which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence. Such investments are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet and are considered available-for-sale. All available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value, with the difference between cost and fair market value, net of related tax effects, recorded in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity (Notes 11 and 12).

Other investments for which there are not readily determinable market values are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, which provides that they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the company had cost method investments with carrying amounts of $38.5 million and $13.7 million, respectively, which are included in other assets.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined principally by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method with certain of the company’s businesses utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company assesses the carrying value of this inventory based on a lower of cost or market analysis. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income. The components of inventories are as follows:

The company recorded a reduction in cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories of $0.1 million and $0.3 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment (including software), 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property, plant and equipment consists of the following:

Acquisition-related Intangible Assets

Acquisition-related intangible assets include the costs of acquired customer relationships, product technology, tradenames and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 20 years. In addition, the company has tradenames and in-process research and development that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. The company reviews intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired. Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows:

The joint ventures were formed to combine the company’s capabilities with those of businesses contributed by the respective joint venture partners in the fields of integrated response technology services and disposable laboratory glass products. The results of the joint ventures were not material for any period presented. The company made purchases of products for resale from the glass products joint venture totaling $46.2 million, $46.6 million and $48.3 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Goodwill

The company assesses the realizability of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company’s reporting units. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. When an impairment is indicated, any excess of carrying value over the implied fair value of goodwill is recorded as an operating loss. The company completed annual tests for impairment at October 31, 2014 and November 1, 2013, and determined that goodwill was not impaired.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation is conditional on a future event, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash outflow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as interest expense. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the company had recorded asset retirement obligations of $39.0 million and $28.2 million, respectively, which are primarily included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet.

Loss Contingencies

Accruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at fair value and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.

Advertising

The company records advertising costs as expenses as incurred, except for certain direct-response advertising, which is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected period of future benefit,

generally one to three years. Direct-response advertising consists of external catalog production and mailing costs, and amortization of these costs begins on the date the catalogs are first mailed. Advertising expense was $47.7 million, $33.2 million and $39.5 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities of the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were a net gain of $33.0 million in 2014, and net losses of $16.6 million and $11.0 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Derivative Contracts

The company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.

The company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. These contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen, Norwegian kroner, and Swedish kronor. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. As of December 31, 2014, the company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts that were hedging anticipated purchases or sales.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The company’s euro-denominated 2.00% Senior Notes, due 2025, have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity.

Cash flow hedges.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2014, the company had no outstanding derivative contracts that were accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Fair value hedges.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings. During 2011 and 2013, in connection with new debt issuances, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements. The company includes the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate debt) in the same line item (interest expense) as the offsetting effective portion of the loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates were made in estimating future cash flows to assess potential impairment of assets and in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets (Note 2) and the ultimate loss from abandoning leases at facilities being exited (Note 14). Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify income statement classification by removing the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP. As a result, items that are both unusual and infrequent will no longer be separately reported net of tax after continuing operations. The company adopted this guidance effective January 2015. The adoption of this standard in 2015 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for the company in 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The company is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations will be presented as discontinued operations. The new guidance also requires disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of the company that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The company adopted this guidance effective January 2015. The adoption of this standard in 2015 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

Note 2.            Acquisitions and Dispositions

The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products.

Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.


On February 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, for a total purchase price of $15.30 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $2.28 billion of debt. The company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition (Notes 9 and 11). Life Technologies provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing. The acquisition of Life Technologies extends customer reach and broadens the company’s offerings in biosciences; genetic, medical and applied sciences; and bioproduction. Life Technologies’ revenues totaled $3.87 billion in 2013. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $7.17 billion was allocated to goodwill, substantially none of which is tax deductible.

During 2013, the company made contingent purchase price and post closing adjustment payments totaling $40 million for acquisitions completed prior to 2013. The contingent purchase price payments were contractually due to the sellers upon achievement of certain performance criteria at the acquired businesses.


In September 2012, the company acquired One Lambda, a provider of transplant diagnostics, for approximately $885 million, net of cash acquired, including related real estate plus $25 million of additional contingent consideration based upon the achievement of specified operating results in the year following the acquisition. The company recorded $13 million as the fair value of contingent consideration at the acquisition date and an additional $

12 million as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense in 2013. The $

25 million contingent purchase price obligation was paid in 2013. The acquisition was within the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The acquisition of One Lambda enhanced the segment’s presence in specialty

in vitro

diagnostics and added new capabilities to the company’s transplant-testing workflow. Revenues of One Lambda were $182 million in 2011. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $274 million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.

In May 2012, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Doe & Ingalls Management, LLC, a North Carolina-based channel for specialty production chemicals and provider of customized supply-chain services to the life sciences and microelectronics industries, for $175 million. The acquisition expands the segment’s products and services that address the production market. Revenues of Doe & Ingalls totaled approximately $110 million in 2011. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $81 million was allocated to goodwill, $53 million of which is tax deductible.

In addition, in 2012, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a manufacturer and supplier of radioactive isotope identifiers, x-ray and gamma-ray detectors and spectroscopy systems used to detect radioactive and other nuclear materials in security and environmental settings and a manufacturer of miniature NMR spectrometers. The company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, a business that holds proprietary technology for tests to diagnose pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions was $25 million plus contingent consideration of up to $15 million.

The company made contingent purchase price and post closing adjustment payments totaling $6 million in 2012, for acquisitions completed prior to 2012.

Unaudited Pro Forma Information

The company acquired Life Technologies in February 2014. Revenues of Life Technologies after the date of acquisition are included in the accompanying statement of income and totaled approximately $3.61 billion in 2014. Immediately upon the closing of the acquisition, the company began integrating Life Technologies and as such the legacy and acquired businesses are now sharing various selling, general and administrative functions. As a result, computing a separate measure of Life Technologies’ stand-alone profitability for periods after the acquisition date is not practical.

Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed as of the beginning of 2013, the company’s pro forma results for 2014 and 2013 would have been as follows:

Dispositions

On August 15, 2014, the company sold its Cole-Parmer specialty channel business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment, for $480 million in cash, net of cash divested. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $134 million, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. Due to the low tax basis in the Cole-Parmer business, the tax provision related to the sale slightly exceeded the pre-tax gain, resulting in a $

4 million after-tax loss on the sale of the business. Revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately $232 million and $43 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $149 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.

Note 5.

Stock-based Compensation Expense

The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vestings. Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder’s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).

Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier.

The components of stock-based compensation expense are as follows:

Certain pre-acquisition equity awards of Life Technologies were converted to rights to receive future cash payments over the remaining vesting period. In addition to stock-based compensation, which is included in the above table, in 2014, the company recorded expense for cash-in-lieu of equity of $

34.8 million related to these arrangements.

The company has elected to recognize any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in capital in excess of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company. The company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes. Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess of par value on the accompanying balance sheet were $65.4 million, $46.6 million and $18.7 million, respectively, in 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Stock Options

The company’s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value. Options vest over 3-5 years with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions. Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions. The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company’s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:

The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $26.89, $19.84 and $15.36, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $207.9 million, $189.8 million and $125.4 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option.

A summary of the company’s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 is presented below:

As of December 31, 2014, there was $77 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2018 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.5 years.

Restricted Share/Unit Awards

Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The awards generally vest over 3-4 years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions. The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents. The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company’s shares on the grant date. For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.

As of December 31, 2014, there was $101 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock unit awards. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2018 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.2 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company. Shares may be purchased under the program at

95% of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period. Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to

10% of each participating employee’s gross wages. The company issued 119,000, 100,000 and 151,000 shares, respectively, of its common stock for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 plan years, which ended on December 31.

Note 6.            Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans

The company’s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company charged to expense $118.4 million, $87.3 million and $86.0 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Employees of a number of the company’s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis.

The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.

When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.

The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company made cash contributions of approximately $49.6 million, $38.2 million and $23.3 million, respectively. Additionally, in 2013 the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans. Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $40 and $60 million for 2015.

Domestic Pension Plan Assets

The company’s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates. The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility. The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities. The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than

1% of invested assets) of private equity investments. The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately

28% to funds investing in U.S. equities, including a sub-allocation of approximately

2% to real estate-related equities, approximately

24% to funds investing in international equities and approximately

47% to funds investing in fixed income securities. The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

Non-U.S. Pension Plan Assets

The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S. The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans. Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies. When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers. For plans not currently managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments are substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income securities with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately

35% -

70% for equities and

30% -

65% for fixed income securities. For plans managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments also include hedge funds, multi-asset funds and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately

3% -

10% for equities,

45% -

65% for fixed income,

10% -

20% for hedge funds,

4% -

5% for multi-asset funds and

18% -

22% for funds holding derivatives. The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions. Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

The tables above present the fair value of the company’s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12). Certain pension plan assets are measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company’s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions. The fair value of the company’s private equity investments, which are classified as level 3 investments, are based on valuations provided by the respective funds. There was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension plan assets during the years presented.

The company has significant activities in Singapore and has received considerable tax incentives. The local taxing authority granted the company pioneer company status which provides an incentive encouraging companies to undertake activities that have the effect of promoting economic or technological development in Singapore. This incentive equates to a tax exemption on earnings associated with most of the company’s manufacturing activities in Singapore and continues through December 31, 2021. The impact of this tax holiday decreased the annual effective tax rate by 1.6% and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.08 in 2014.

In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2014. In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2013. In addition, the impact of tax law changes in certain foreign jurisdictions reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2013. The impact of change in tax laws and apportionment on deferred taxes in 2012 includes $55 million of benefit from a tax rate reduction enacted in Sweden.

The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. At December 31, 2014, all of the company’s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.

At December 31, 2014, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $131.5 million, $830.3 million and $2.61 billion, respectively. Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2015 through 2034. Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $277.5 million expire in the years 2015 through 2033, and the remainder do not expire. The company also had $209.3 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2014, which expire in the years 2015 through 2024.

A provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $8.44 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost. It is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized tax liability due to i) the extent of uncertainty as to which remittance structure would be used (among several possibilities) should a decision be made to repatriate; ii) the availability and the complexity of calculating foreign tax credits; and iii) the implications of indirect taxes, including withholding taxes that could potentially be required depending on the repatriation structure.

As of December 31, 2013, short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included $280.0 million of commercial paper, short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of the company’s subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 0.58% at December 31, 2013. The company had no outstanding short-term borrowings at December 31, 2014. In addition to available borrowings under the company’s revolving credit agreements, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $107.7 million as of December 31, 2014. These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.

Credit Facilities

The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. In February 2015, the maximum capacity of this facility was increased from $1.50 billion to $2.00 billion. The facility expires in July 2018. The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenant requires the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) below 4.5 to 1.0 until February 2015 and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, by August 2015 and an Interest Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) to interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0. The credit agreement permits the company to use the facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate purposes. The credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $59 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.

Commercial Paper Program

The company has a U.S. commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and the CP Notes rank pari passu with all of the company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. CP Notes are issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under this program.

Term Loan

In connection with the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company entered into an unsecured term loan agreement. The term loan agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The term loan agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenants require the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) below 4.5 to 1.0 until February 2015 and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, by August 2015. The company must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2014, outstanding borrowings under the term loan agreement were $1.28 billion. The company is required to make minimum periodic payments through March 2016. Borrowings may be prepaid without penalty.

Senior Notes

Interest on the euro-denominated 2.00% Senior Notes due 2025 is payable annually. Interest on each of the other senior notes is payable semi-annually.

Each of the notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.

The 4.40% Senior Notes due 2015, 3.50% Senior Notes due 2016, 6.00% Senior Notes due 2020 and 5.00% Senior Notes due 2021 were assumed by the company in connection with the Life Technologies acquisition. The fair value of these senior notes on the date of acquisition exceeded the par value by $207 million which was recorded as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt and will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective debt instruments. This adjustment does not affect cash interest payments.

Interest Rate Swap Arrangements

In 2013, upon the issuance of $

900 million principal amount of 1.30% Senior Notes due 2017, the company entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amount of the swaps is equal to the principal amount of the 1.30% Notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the payment dates of the 1.30% Notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of

0.6616% (

0.8166% at December 31, 2014) and to receive a fixed rate of

1.30%. The variable interest rate resets monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as a fair value hedge of the 1.30% Notes. See Note 12 for additional information.

Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements

In 2013, prior to issuing the 4.15% Senior Notes due 2024, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering. Based on the company’s conclusion that a debt offering was probable as a result of near-term debt maturities and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $700 million of principal amount of the planned 10-year fixed-rate debt issue. In December 2013, the company issued senior notes and terminated the swap arrangements. The company received $11 million at the termination of these agreements and recorded a gain of $1 million on the ineffective portion in other expense, net in the accompanying statement of income. The remaining favorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination (the effective portion) was $6 million, net of tax, and was classified as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholder’s equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2024.

Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount of the company’s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $357.8 million at December 31, 2014 and

the majority of these obligations are expected to be settled during 2015.

Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments

Financial Statement Index

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The company has funding commitments totaling $5.4 million at December 31, 2014, related to investments it owns.

In 2012, the company entered into an off-balance sheet build-to-suit financing arrangement with a financial institution to fund construction of an operating facility in the U.S. Upon completion of construction in 2014, a five-year lease commenced with options to purchase the facility or renew the lease for up to three 5-year terms. The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 9), and has guaranteed the facility’s residual value at the end of the lease, up to a maximum of $58 million.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.

In connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of operations.

In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions.

Environmental Matters

The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $32 million and $29 million, respectively. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Litigation and Related Contingencies

There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment, and contractual issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, and, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for matters discussed below for which accrual amounts are not disclosed, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters

The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company’s continuing operations at December 31, 2014, was approximately $226 million to $351 million on an undiscounted basis. The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger. The company’s accrual for all such matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $186 million at December 31, 2014 (or $226 million undiscounted). The accrual includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $93 million at December 31, 2014 (or $118 million undiscounted). The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger. In addition to the above accrual, as of December 31, 2014, the company had a product liability accrual of $9 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses.

The assets and liabilities assumed at the merger date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67%). The discount on the liabilities of approximately $40 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $25 million (net discount $15 million) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.

Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis.

Intellectual Property Matters

On February 3, 2014, the company acquired Life Technologies. Life Technologies and its subsidiaries are party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim infringement of their intellectual property, including the following:

On June 6, 2004, Enzo Biochem, Enzo Life Sciences and Yale University filed a complaint against Life Technologies in United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs allege patent infringement by Applera’s labeled DNA terminator products used in DNA sequencing and fragment analysis. The plaintiff sought damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, prejudgment interest, and injunctive relief. In November 2012, the jury awarded damages of $

48.5 million. Prejudgment interest of $

12.4 million was also granted. The $

60.9 million judgment and interest was accrued by Life Technologies and the liability was assumed by the company as of the date of the acquisition. The case is currently on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

The amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive items are as follows:

Shareholders’ Equity

At December 31, 2014, the company had reserved 39.6 million unissued shares of its common stock for possible issuance under stock-based compensation plans.

The company has 50,000 shares of authorized but unissued $100 par value preferred stock.

Shareholder Rights Plan

The company has distributed rights under a shareholder rights plan adopted by the company’s Board of Directors to holders of outstanding shares of the company’s common stock. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one hundred-thousandth of a share (a Unit) of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $100 par value, at a purchase price of $200 per Unit, subject to adjustment. The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person) has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (the Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii) 10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In the event that a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, except pursuant to an offer for all outstanding shares of common stock that at least 75% of the Board of Directors determines to be fair to, and otherwise in the best interests of, stockholders, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock (or, in certain circumstances, units of preferred stock, cash, property or other securities of the company) which equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of the common stock. In the event that, at any time after any person has become an Acquiring Person, (i) the company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the company is not the surviving corporation or its common stock is changed or exchanged (other than a merger that follows an offer approved by the Board of Directors), or (ii) 50% or more of the company’s assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of such common stock.

At any time until the Stock Acquisition Date, the company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right (payable in cash or stock). The rights expire on September 29, 2015, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged.

The cost of available-for-sale investments that were sold was based on specific identification in determining realized gains and losses recorded in the accompanying statement of income. In 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million. Gross realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale investments were $2 million in 2014 and nominal in 2013 and 2012. Gross realized losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments were nominal in 2014, 2013 and 2012.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determined the fair value of the auction rate securities by obtaining indications of value from brokers/dealers. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on assessment of the probability that the company would be required to make such future payment. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.

In the second quarter of 2014, the company sold all of its auction rate securities and realized a net gain of $1.4 million. There was no significant activity within the auction rate securities during 2013.

The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by Level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration.

Gains and losses recognized on currency exchange contracts and the effective portion of interest rate swaps are included in the consolidated statement of income together with the corresponding, offsetting losses and gains on the underlying hedged transactions. Gains and losses recognized on the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps are included in other expense, net in the accompanying statement of income.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The company’s euro-denominated 2.00% Senior Notes, due 2025, have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity. In 2014, the cumulative translation adjustment includes pre-tax net gains of $

20.9 million from the euro-denominated notes.

In 2013, the company recorded an after-tax charge of $

4.2 million for the estimated cost to raze certain abandoned facilities of discontinued operations prior to the planned sale of the related land.

In June 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, the company’s senior management made a decision to pursue a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The company completed the sale in October 2012 for nominal proceeds. The results of the laboratory workstations business have been classified and presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.

In 2012, the company recorded an after-tax loss of $

63 million on the divestiture. In addition, the company recorded an after-tax gain of $

2 million upon receipt of additional proceeds from a prior divestiture.
