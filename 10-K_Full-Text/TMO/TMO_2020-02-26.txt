We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position.

Raw Materials

Our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources. We do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business.

Raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results.

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks

Patents are important in many aspects of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts.

We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to patents and know-how.

Seasonal Influences

Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season. Sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens.

Working Capital Requirements

There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital.

Dependency on a Single Customer

There is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. No customer accounted for more than 5% of our total revenues in any of the past three years.

Backlog

Our backlog of firm orders at year-end 2019 and 2018 was as follows:

We believe that approximately 63% of our backlog at the end of 2019 will be filled during 2020.

Government Contracts

Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results.

Competition

The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors. Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success primarily depends on the following factors:

•

technical performance and advances in technology that result in new products and improved price/performance ratios;

•

product differentiation, availability and reliability;

•

the depth of our capabilities;

•

our reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and services;

•

customer service and support;

•

active research and application-development programs; and

•

relative prices of our products and services.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.

In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.

A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures.

Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State’s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the USEPA to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. In 2018, the USEPA issued a Record of Decision, including the scope of required remediation work based on findings of this study. In 2019, the company and another responsible party signed a proposed consent decree that, once approved by the court, requires the parties to finance and perform the required remediation work with USEPA oversight. In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island.

We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $66 million at December 31, 2019.

These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Regulatory Affairs

Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.

We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.

Number of Employees

We have more than 75,000 employees.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in

Item 1. Business

under the caption “Forward-looking Statements”.

We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.

Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.

Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.

It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.

Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:

•

strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets;

•

allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;

•

developing new applications for our technologies;

•

expanding our service offerings;


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Risk Factors (continued)

•

continuing key customer initiatives;

•

combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively;

•

finding new markets for our products; and

•

continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.

We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.

Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.

Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of

•

reducing demand for some of our products;

•

increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays;

•

increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;

•

increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services;

•

causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and

•

creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds.

Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.

Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns.

Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.

Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities.

Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.

Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.

International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2019, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $440 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services.

In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

•

interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;

•

changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;

•

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers;


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Risk Factors (continued)

•

tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods;

•

the impact of public health epidemics on the global economy, such as the coronavirus currently impacting China;

•

negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;

•

differing labor regulations;

•

differing protection of intellectual property;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and

•

geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war.

For example, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union, or EU and entered a transition period during which it will negotiate a trade deal with the EU. This withdrawal has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses.

Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.

We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.

Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, we manufacture pharmaceuticals and many of our instruments are marketed to the


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Risk Factors (continued)

pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.

Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer.

Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether.

In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant.

We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.

We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators.

Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.

Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.

Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $25.71 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $12.76 billion as of December 31, 2019. We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses.


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Risk Factors (continued)

If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.

We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.

We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.

Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us.

Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.

Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.

We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.

We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.

We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (the FDA), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), in Europe, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.

The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers.

We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and we are required to


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Risk Factors (continued)

comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.

We have internal controls and compliance systems to protect the company against acts committed by employees, agents or businesses that we acquire that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, but we cannot provide assurance that these controls and systems will prevent every such wrongful act. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies which we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.

Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could impact customer spending.

We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. An earthquake or other natural disaster such as a fire or hurricane or power shortages or outages could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact customer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could also adversely impact our operating results. For example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The effects could include restrictions on our ability to travel to support our sites in China or our customers located there, disruptions in our ability to distribute products, and/or temporary closures of our facilities in China or the facilities of our suppliers or customers. Related disruption, inside or outside of China, to our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results of operations is uncertain.

Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.

Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.

Our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.

Some of our businesses purchase certain materials from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If

these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.

A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business.

As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.

If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.

Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $17.75 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.

Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.

Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures.


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Risk Factors (continued)

Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.

Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.

Consolidated Financial Statements

, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2017 is included in Item 7 of the company’s 2018

Annual Report on Form 10-K

filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Overview

The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (see Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services.

Recent Acquisitions and Divestiture

The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestiture are described below.

On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment’s bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. The Advanced Bioprocessing business reported revenues of $100 million in 2017.

On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. Brammer Bio reported revenues of approximately $140 million in 2018.

On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $478 million, included in restructuring and other (income) costs, net. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $115 million and $238 million, respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses.

Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity

Sales in 2019 were $25.54 billion, an increase of $1.18 billion from 2018. Sales increased $153 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $440 million in 2019. Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $1.47 billion (6%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company’s primary end markets grew with particular strength in sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, sales to industrial customers declined and sales growth in Asia was modest due to weaker end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter in 2018.


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)

In 2019, total company operating income and operating income margin were $4.59 billion and 18.0%, respectively, compared with $3.78 billion and 15.5%, respectively, in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales, the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.

The company recorded a $374 million provision for income taxes in 2019 including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements, implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense, and recorded a $79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable.

The company recorded a $324 million provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the Anatomical Pathology business.

The effective tax rate in both 2019 and 2018 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $896 million and $591 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The company expects its effective tax rate in 2020 will be between 8% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events.

Income from continuing operations increased to $3.70 billion in 2019, from $2.94 billion in 2018 principally due to increase in operating income in 2019 (discussed above) offset in part by $184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2019 (Note 10).

During 2019, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $4.97 billion compared with $4.54 billion for 2018. The increase primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation and lower investment in working capital in the 2019 period.

As of December 31, 2019, the company’s short-term debt totaled $676 million, including $672 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.

The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion as of December 31, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:

(a)

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.76 billion at December 31, 2019. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.

The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $25.71 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company considers (i) peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and (ii) estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.

For reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test, indications of fair value based on projections of profitability and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2019, the date of the company’s annual impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.

(b)

Income Taxes

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1.55 billion at December 31, 2019.

The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income.

The company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $408 million at December 31, 2019. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.

The company has not provided U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies. These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company’s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional tax liabilities. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional U.S. state income tax and non-U.S. tax liabilities that the company would incur. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs.

(c)

Contingencies and Litigation

The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, are initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

2019 Compared With 2018

*   Currency Translation/Other for the Laboratory Products and Services segment includes a reduction of revenue of $60 million for the impact of a change in the method of reporting certain intersegment sales with no impact on consolidated results.

Sales in 2019 were $25.54 billion, an increase of $1.18 billion from 2018. Sales increased $153 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $440 million in 2019. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $1.47 billion (6%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company’s primary end markets grew with particular strength in sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, sales to industrial customers declined and sales growth in Asia was modest due to weaker end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter in 2018.

In 2019, total company operating income and operating income margin were $4.59 billion and 18.0%, respectively, compared with $3.78 billion and 15.5%, respectively, in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales, the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.

In 2019, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $334 million, including $482 million of net gains on the sale of businesses, principally the Anatomical Pathology business (see Note 2). The company also recorded $17 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and $62 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction and integration-related costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture. In addition, the company recorded $52 million of cash restructuring charges, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 16).

In 2018, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million, including $12 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $29 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent and pending acquisitions, offset in part by income from favorable results of product liability litigation. In addition, the company recorded $88 million of cash restructuring costs, in its continued effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $38 million of other income, net, principally for resolution of a litigation matter.

As of February 26, 2020, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $65 million, primarily in 2020, and expects to identify additional actions during 2020 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred. Approximately 25% of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, 30% in the Analytical Instruments segment, 35% in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, and 10% in the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2019 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $60 million beginning in part in 2019 and, to a greater extent, in 2020, including $20 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $15 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $20

million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2018 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $65 million beginning in part in 2018 and to a greater extent in 2019, including $20 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $30 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

Segment Results

The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 6% to $5.97 billion in 2019 due primarily to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments, sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.

Life Sciences Solutions


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations (continued)

Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $587 million to $6.86 billion in 2019. Sales increased $620 million (10%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $89 million due to an acquisition. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $122 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in sales of bioproduction and biosciences products.

Operating income margin was 35.7% in 2019 compared to 34.4% in 2018. The increase in operating margin resulted primarily from profit on higher sales offset in part by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.

Analytical Instruments

Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $53 million to $5.52 billion in 2019. Sales increased $149 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $96 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to increased demand for products sold by each of the segment's primary businesses with particular strength in chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments. Sales decreased in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to industrial end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter of 2018.

Operating income margin was 23.1% in 2019 compared to 22.8% in 2018. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by sales mix and strategic growth investments.

Specialty Diagnostics

Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment remained flat at $3.72 billion in 2019. Sales increased $186 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $66 million and the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business decreased revenues by $126 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to increased demand for products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel as well as clinical diagnostic and immunodiagnostic products.

Operating income margin was 25.0% in 2019 and 25.6% in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix and the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business. These decreases were offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. Following multi-year extensions of several expiring licensing arrangements with commercial partners, segment revenues and operating income in 2020 will both be unfavorably affected by approximately $30 million.

Laboratory Products and Services

Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $564 million to $10.60 billion in 2019. Sales increased $604 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $187 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $167 million. A change in the method of reporting certain intersegment sales reduced segment revenues by $60 million with no impact to consolidated results. The increase in revenue at

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations (continued)

existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in service offerings of its pharma services business and products sold through its research and safety market channel business.

Operating income margin was 12.5% in both 2019 and 2018. Increases from profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, were offset by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix.

Other Expense/Income, Net

In

2019, the company recorded $184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt, offset in part by $44 million of net gains on investments. The investment gains include a $28 million gain on the sale of a joint venture for net proceeds of $42 million. In 2018, the company recorded $15 million of net losses on investments.

Provision for Income Taxes

The company recorded a $374 million provision for income taxes in 2019 including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements, implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense, and recorded a $79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable.

The company recorded a $324 million provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the Anatomical Pathology business.

The effective tax rate in both 2019 and 2018 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $896 million and $591 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The company expects its effective tax rate in 2020 will be between 8% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events.

The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $5.70 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $4.48 billion at December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower short-term debt and higher cash balances. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion at December 31, 2019 and $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018.


Cash provided by operating activities was $4.97 billion during 2019. Cash provided by income was offset in part by increased investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $225 million and $458 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $408 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings and tax refunds. Other liabilities increased by $210 million primarily due to advance payments from customers. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $896 million during 2019, compared with $591 million in 2018. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $50 million during 2019. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $69 million during 2019.

During 2019, the company’s investing activities used $1.49 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.84 billion. Proceeds from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business provided $1.13 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $926 million of property, plant and equipment.

The company’s financing activities used $3.12 billion of cash during 2019. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $6.36 billion. New long-term borrowings provided cash of $5.64 billion. A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $683 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $297 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $153 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On November 8, 2019, the Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock, of which $500 million was remaining, with a new authorization to repurchase up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At February 26, 2020, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock.

As of December 31, 2019, the company’s short-term debt totaled $676 million, including $672 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.

Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future.

The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion as of December 31, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.


Cash provided by operating activities was $4.54 billion during 2018. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $366 million and $324 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $591 million during 2018, compared with $479 million in 2017. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $93 million during 2018. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $83 million during 2018.

During 2018, the company’s investing activities used $1.25 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $536 million. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $758 million of property, plant and equipment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

The company’s financing activities used $2.24 billion of cash during 2018. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.05 billion. New long-term borrowings provided cash of $690 million. A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $194 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $500 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $266 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $136 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2017, 2018 or 2019, except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, residual value guarantees under three lease agreements, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. The amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees relate to guarantees of the company’s performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments

The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019.

(a)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs.

(b)

Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.

Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.55 billion have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions.

The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2020, such expenditures will be between $1 and $1.1 billion.

Guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see Note 11). The residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $147 million. The terms of these leases end in 2020, 2023 and 2024.

A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2019 was $41 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.

The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See

Item 1. Business

– Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Swiss franc, euro, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and Czech koruna. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.

Interest Rates

The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2019, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2019 was $18.67 billion (see Note 14). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2019 would increase by approximately $1.49 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2019 would decrease by approximately $1.50 billion.

In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2019, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $16 million.

Currency Exchange Rates

The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Canadian dollars, Swiss franc, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2019 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $1.14 billion.

The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2019 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $243 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2019 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $203 million. The


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued)

unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.

Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2019 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $32 million on the company’s net income.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management, including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a

F-2

material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Goodwill impairment assessment

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $25,714 million as of December 31, 2019. Management evaluates goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In performing the assessment, management estimates the fair values of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. As disclosed by management, estimates of discounted future cash flows require management to make assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. Management also considers peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and estimates weighted average costs of capital.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when estimating the fair value of the reporting units. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s cash flow projections and significant assumptions, including revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and peer market multiples. In addition, the audit

F-3

effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the development of assumptions used by management to estimate the fair values of the Company’s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the models; and evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions used, including revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and peer market multiples. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units and (ii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating the reasonableness of the peer market multiples assumption involved evaluating the population of peer companies used in the analyses and testing selected market data used by management to determine the multiples by comparison to publicly available information. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Company’s discounted cash flow model and certain significant assumptions, including the discount rates.

Income taxes

As described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total income tax expense for the period ended December 31, 2019 was $374 million. The Company has deferred income tax liabilities, net, of $1,619 million (including a valuation allowance of $408 million) and unrecognized income tax benefits of $1,552 million as of December 31, 2019. As disclosed by management, the Company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires management to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and t0 use estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Management assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, management has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.  For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Management estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which management has been able to determine that the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, management reverses the related valuation allowance. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to numerous and complex tax laws, the frequency of tax filings, as well as judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including controls over management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the accuracy of the income tax provision, including the rate reconciliation and permanent and temporary differences, (ii) evaluating whether the data utilized in the calculation of the provision for income taxes was appropriate and consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit, (iii) evaluating management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis, (iv) evaluating the identification of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonableness of the “more likely than not” determination in consideration of jurisdictions, court decisions, legislative actions, statutes of limitations, and developments in tax examinations, (v) testing the calculation of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits by jurisdiction, including estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained, and (vi) evaluating the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments and estimates, including application of foreign and domestic tax laws and regulations.

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics, deliver medicines to market and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company accounts for investments in businesses using the equity method when it has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control (generally between 20% and 50% ownership) and is not the primary beneficiary.

Presentation

Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation.

Revenue Recognition

Prior to 2018, the company recognized revenue after all significant obligations had been met, collectability was probable and title had passed, which typically occurred upon shipment, delivery, completion of services, or ratably over the contract period. Beginning in 2018, the company recognizes revenue as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. See

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

below for a discussion of the change in revenue recognition accounting that became effective in 2018.

Consumables revenues consist of single-use products and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer-lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues (clinical trial logistics, pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, asset management, diagnostic testing, training, service contracts, and field services including related time and materials) are recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services. For revenues recognized over time, the company generally uses costs accumulated relative to total estimated costs to measure progress as this method approximates satisfaction of the performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. The company exercises judgment in determining the timing of revenue by analyzing the point in time or the period over which the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the asset. The company immediately expenses contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year.

Payments from customers for most instruments, consumables and services are typically due in a fixed number of days after shipment or delivery of the product. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g. extended service contracts), upon completion of the service (e.g. pharmaceutical development and manufacturing) or a mix of both.

See Note 3 for revenue disaggregated by type and by geographic region as well as further information about remaining performance obligations.

Contract-related Balances

Accounts receivable include amounts that have been billed and are currently due from customers. They are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers.

F-11

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows:

Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings and are recorded net of estimated losses resulting from the inability to invoice customers. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration becomes unconditional. Noncurrent contract assets are included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet.

Contract liabilities include billings in excess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenue on service contracts. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the periods over which remaining performance obligations are expected to be transferred to customers. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet if they arise from different performance obligations in the same contract.

Contract asset and liability balances are as follows:

Substantially all of the current contract liabilities balance at December 31, 2018 and January 1 2018, was recognized in revenue during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Contract assets increased in 2019 primarily due to growth in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services. Contract liabilities increased during 2019 primarily due to an advance payment from a customer and an acquisition.

Warranty Obligations

The company provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of product revenues at the time product revenue is recognized. While the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs or supplier warranties on parts differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Extended warranty agreements are considered service contracts, which are discussed above. Costs of service contracts are recognized as incurred.

The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Leases

The company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Prior to 2019, the company did not account for operating leases on the balance sheet. Beginning in 2019, as discussed below under Recent Accounting Pronouncements, operating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of operating lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the expected timing of payments due under the company’s obligations.

Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Because most of the company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms may include the effect of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

As a lessee, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

See Note 11 additional information about the company's leases.

Research and Development

The company conducts research and development activities to increase its depth of capabilities in technologies, software and services. Research and development costs include employee compensation and benefits, consultants, facilities related costs, material costs, depreciation and travel. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Restructuring Costs

Accounting for the timing and amount of termination benefits provided by the company to employees is determined based on whether: (a) the company has a substantive plan to provide such benefits, (b) the company has a written employment contract with the affected employees that includes a provision for such benefits, (c) the termination benefits are due to the occurrence of an event specified in an existing plan or agreement, or (d) the termination benefits are a one-time benefit. In certain circumstances, employee termination benefits may meet more than one of the characteristics listed above and therefore, may have individual elements that are subject to different accounting models.

From time to time when executing a restructuring or exit plan, the company also incurs costs other than termination benefits, such as lease termination costs, that are not associated with or will not be incurred to generate revenues. These include costs that represent amounts under contractual obligations that exist prior to the restructuring plan communication date and will either continue after the restructuring plan is completed with no economic benefit or result in a penalty to cancel a contractual obligation. Such costs are recognized when incurred, which generally occurs at the contract termination or over the period from when a plan to abandon a leased facility is approved through the cease-use date but charges may continue over the remainder of the original contractual period.

F-13

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Income Taxes

The company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return.

The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money (Note 8).

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share has been computed using the treasury stock method for outstanding stock options and restricted units (Note 9).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined principally by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method with certain of the company’s businesses utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company assesses the carrying value of this inventory based on a lower of cost or net realizable value analysis. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income.

The components of inventories are as follows:

The value of inventories maintained using the LIFO method was $


million and $


million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which was below estimated replacement cost by $


million and $


million, respectively. Reductions to cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories were nominal during the three years ended December 31, 2019.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements,


to


years; machinery and equipment (including software),


to


years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income.

Property, plant and equipment consists of the following:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Depreciation and amortization expense of property, plant and equipment was $


million, $


million and $


million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Acquisition-related Intangible Assets

Acquisition-related intangible assets include the costs of acquired customer relationships, product technology, tradenames and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from


to


years. In addition, the company has tradenames and in-process research and development that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. The company reviews intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired.

Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows:

The estimated future amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets with definite lives is as follows:

1.74

billion and $

1.59

Other Assets

Other assets in the accompanying balance sheet include operating lease right-of-use assets, deferred tax assets, pension assets, cash surrender value of life insurance, insurance recovery receivables related to product liability matters, investments and other assets.

Prior to January 1, 2018, investments for which there are not readily determinable market values were accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The company periodically evaluated the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, which provided that they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Effective January 1, 2018, equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The company performs qualitative assessments to identify impairments of these investments.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had such investments with carrying amounts of $


million and $


million, respectively, which are included in other assets.

Goodwill

The company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company’s reporting units. The company is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the goodwill impairment test is necessary. If the qualitative assessment results in a determination that the fair value of a reporting unit is more-likely-than-not less than its carrying amount, the company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The company may bypass the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the goodwill impairment test. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. The company would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (limited to the amount of goodwill). The company determined that no impairments existed in 2019, 2018 or 2017.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows:

Loss Contingencies

Accruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records

F-16

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at fair value and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.

Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities of the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period.

Currency transaction gains (losses) are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $


million, $


million and $(


) million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Derivative Contracts

The company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.

The company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Swiss franc, euro, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and Czech koruna. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.

Cash flow hedges

. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.

Fair value hedges.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.

Net investment hedges.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the interaction of the accounting for certain equity securities, equity method investments, and certain forward contracts and purchased options. Among other things, the new guidance clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying measurement principles for certain equity securities immediately before applying or discontinuing the equity method. The company expects to adopt this guidance in 2020 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate

F-17

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company expects to adopt this guidance when it is effective in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates.

In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company will adopt the guidance in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures.

In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company will adopt the guidance in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures.

In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to allow reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive items (AOCI) to retained earnings for certain tax effects on items within AOCI resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The company adopted this guidance in January 2018 and recorded the reclassifications in the period of adoption. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance is included in the table below. This guidance only relates to the effects of the Tax Act. For all other tax law changes that have occurred or may occur in the future, the company reclassifies the tax effects to the consolidated statement of income on an item-by-item basis when the pre-tax item in AOCI is reclassified to income.

In December 2017, the SEC staff issued guidance to address the application of accounting guidance in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The company reported provisional amounts in its 2017 financial statements for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for which a reasonable estimate could be determined. Adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period, which ended December 22, 2018, are included as adjustments to Provision for Income Taxes in 2018 (Note 8).

In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance. Among other things, the new guidance will permit more hedging strategies to qualify for hedge accounting, allow for additional time to perform an initial assessment of a hedge’s effectiveness, and permit a qualitative effectiveness test for certain hedges after initial qualification. The company adopted this guidance in January 2018. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance is included in the table below.

In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance eliminating the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers. The impact of this guidance in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future asset transfers which usually occur in connection with planning around acquisitions and other business structuring activities. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance as of January 1, 2018 is included in the table below.

In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company will adopt the guidance in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with corresponding right-of-use assets. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to leases. During 2017 - 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company adopted this guidance in January 2019. The company elected to adopt the guidance using a modified retrospective method, by applying the transition approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Comparative periods have not been restated. As permitted upon transition, the company did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts were or contained embedded leases, the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, initial direct costs for any leases, or whether land easements met the definition of a lease if they were not accounted for as leases under the prior guidance.

Adoption of the new guidance impacted the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:

F-18

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This guidance requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes recognized in net income, except for those accounted for under the equity method or requiring consolidation. The guidance also changes the accounting for investments without a readily determinable fair value and that do not qualify for the practical expedient permitted by the guidance to estimate fair value. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance as of January 1, 2018 is included in the table below.

In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. During 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification, including the elimination of certain SEC Staff Guidance. The guidance is effective for the company in 2018. The company elected to adopt this guidance through application of the modified retrospective method by applying it to contracts that were not completed as of December 31, 2017 (in addition to new contracts in 2018).

Adoption of new guidance that became effective on January 1, 2018, impacted the company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:

Had the company continued to use the revenue recognition guidance in effect prior to 2018, no material changes would have resulted to the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 from am

ounts reported therein. However, inventories would have b

een $


million higher and other current assets would have been $


million lower as of December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of differences in the accounting for pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services under the new revenue guidance. Under the prior guidance, costs of these services were recorded in inventory and revenues were recognized generally when the products were delivered to customers. Under the new guidance, costs are expensed and revenues are recognized as the manufacturing service is performed and the company's rights to consideration are recorded as contract assets.

Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions

The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products.

Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.


On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $

1.67

billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. Brammer Bio reported revenues of approximately $


million in 2018. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $


million was allocated to goodwill, $


million of which is tax deductible.

In addition, in 2019 the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a Slovakia-based provider of mass spectrometry software used for identification of compounds, and, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, for an aggregate purchase price of $


million.

The components of the purchase price and net assets acquired for 2019 acquisitions are as follows:

On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $


million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment’s bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. The Advanced Bioprocessing business reported revenues of $


million in 2017. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $


million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.

On August 29, 2017, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Patheon N.V., a leading global provider of high-quality drug development and delivery solutions to the pharmaceutical and biopharma sectors, for $

35.00

per share in cash, or $

7.36

billion, including the assumption of net debt. The company financed the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of Patheon, with issuances of debt and equity.

Patheon provides comprehensive, integrated and highly customizable solutions as well as the expertise to help biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes satisfy complex development and manufacturing needs. The acquisition provided entry into the pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization market and added a complementary service to the company’s existing pharmaceutical services portfolio. Patheon reported revenues of $

1.87

billion for the year ended October 31, 2016. The purchase price exceeded the fair market value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $

3.28

billion was allocated to goodwill, $


million of which is tax deductible.

In addition, in 2017 the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a North America-based provider of cloud-based platforms supporting scientific data management; within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, a North America-based developer of scalable control automation systems and software for bioproduction; within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, a North America-based molecular diagnostics company offering qPCR tests to the transplant community; and within the Analytical Instruments segment, a provider of desktop scanning electron microscopy solutions and a manufacturer of volatile organic compound monitoring instruments and integrated systems, for an aggregate purchase price of $


million.

Unaudited Pro Forma Information

The following unaudited pro forma information provides the effect of the company's 2017 acquisition of Patheon as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2016:

To reflect the acquisition of Patheon as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016, the unaudited pro forma results include adjustments to reflect, among other things, the incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on the preliminary values of each identifiable intangible asset and the interest expense from debt financings obtained to partially fund the cash consideration transferred. Pro forma adjustments were tax effected at the company's historical statutory rates in effect for the respective periods. The unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations that would have been realized had the acquisition and related financings occurred on the aforementioned date, nor are they meant to be indicative of any anticipated combined results of operations that the company will experience after the transaction. In addition, the amounts do not include any adjustments for actions that may be taken following the completion of the transaction, such as expected cost savings, operating synergies, or revenue enhancements that may be realized subsequent to the transaction.

Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, excludes certain items associated with the Patheon acquisition that were included in the determination of net income for that period. These items have been included in the determination of pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 (not presented), and are as follows: $

Note 6. Stock-based Compensation Expense

The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vestings. Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder’s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).

Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier.

S

tock-based compensation expense is primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Stock Options

The company’s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value. Options vest over


-


years with terms of


-


years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions. Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions. The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company’s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:

The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $

53.37

, $

43.45

and $

30.73

, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $


million, $


million and $


million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A summary of the company’s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented below:

As of December 31, 2019, there was $


million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2023 with a weighted average amortization period of

2.2

years.

Restricted Share/Unit Awards

Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The awards generally vest over


-


years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions. The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents. The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company’s shares on the grant date. For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.

A summary of the company’s restricted unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented below:

The total fair value of shares vested during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $


million, $


million and $


million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2019, there was $


million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock unit awards. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2023 with a weighted average amortization period of

Note 7. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans

The company’s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company charged to expense $


million, $


million and $


million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Employees of a number of the company’s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis.

The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.

When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.

The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.

During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company made cash contributions of approximately $


million, $


million and $


million, respectively. Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $


and $


million for 2020.

The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between

.

The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.

The company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.

Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.

The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management’s expectations of future salary increases.

The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive items expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in 2020 are not material.

The net periodic postretirement benefit cost was not material in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company’s benefit obligation at December 31, 2019. Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments.

Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:

A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2019 would not have caused a material change in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 and the 2019 aggregate of service and interest costs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Domestic Pension Plan Assets

The company’s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates. The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility. The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities. The target allocations for the investments are approximately


% to funds investing in U.S. equities, approximately


% to funds investing in international equities and approximately


% to funds investing in fixed income securities. The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

Non-U.S. Pension Plan Assets

The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S. The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans. Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies. When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers. The investments may include equity funds, fixed income funds, hedge funds, multi-asset funds, alternative investments and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately


% -


% for equity funds,


% -


% for fixed income funds,


% -


% for hedge funds,


% -


% for multi-asset funds,


% to


% for alternative investments and


% -


% for funds holding derivatives. The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions. Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

The fair values of the company’s plan assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, by asset category are as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations are as follows:

The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the following:

The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. The company's effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate.

U.S. Tax Reform Impacts

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted. The Tax Act includes significant changes to existing U.S. tax laws that affect the company, including a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from


% to


% beginning in 2018 and creation of a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (transition tax). As detailed below, the company recognized a net charge of $


million for certain aspects of the Tax Act in its 2017 financial statements for which the accounting was provisional, but a reasonable

F-35

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

estimate could be determined. During 2018, the company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recognized net adjustments (detailed below) to the provisional amounts, totaling a net charge of $


million, as a component of income tax expense.

The transition tax is based on the company's total post-1986 earnings and profits, the tax on which was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law. The company recorded a provisional amount for the transition tax liability for each of the foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a total transition liability of $

1.25

billion at December 31, 2017. After further analysis of new U.S. Treasury guidance, available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profits computations and foreign taxes, the company finalized the calculations of the transition tax liability during 2018. The increase in the liability for the transition tax in 2018 consisted of an incremental provision of $


million offset in part by a $


million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017.

In 2017, as a result of the Tax Act, the company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (which was generally


%), by recording a provisional tax benefit of $

1.06

billion. During 2018, no material changes to this provisional amount were made.

The Tax Act included a provision for global intangible low-taxed income. The company has adopted a policy to account for this provision as a period cost.

During 2019, the company recorded a net tax provision of $


million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in 2019. The income tax provision consists of an incremental charge of $


million offset by a $


million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits.

Other Tax Impacts

In 2019, the company recorded a $


million income tax benefit, including both U.S. federal and state taxes, related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements as well as a tax provision of $


million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. Also in 2019, the company recorded a $


million benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable.

In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $


million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the Anatomical Pathology business (Note 2).

The foreign tax credits discussed below are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned.

In 2019, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $


million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.

In 2017, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefited from U.S. foreign tax credits of $


million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $


million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017). The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $


million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $


million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes.

The company generally receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock units held by employees, for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes. These excess tax benefits reduce the tax provision. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company's tax provision was reduced by $


million, $


million and $


million, respectively, of such benefits.

Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following:

The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. At December 31, 2019, all of the company’s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses, for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.

The changes in the valuation allowance are as follows:

At December 31, 2019, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $


million, $

1.73

billion and $

4.82

billion, respectively. Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2020 through 2039. Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $

1.98

billion expire in the years 2024 through 2039, and the remainder do not expire.

As a result of the Tax Act, U.S. federal taxes have been recorded on $


billion of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2019. A provision has not been made for certain U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes that would be due when cash is repatriated to the U.S. as the company’s undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable due to the uncertainty in the manner in which these earnings will be distributed. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

As of December 31, 2019, the company had $

1.55

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Substantially all of the total $

1.55

billion liability is classified as a long-term liability. The company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months.

During 2019, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased $


million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $


million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions.

During 2018, the company's unrecognized tax benefits increased $


million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $


million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions.

During 2017, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits provisionally increased $


million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to the scope of the Tax Act’s one-time transition tax, $


million relating to foreign tax positions, $


million as a result of a foreign exchange loss recognized on the refinancing of certain long term inter-company debt and $


million due to an acquisition.

The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $


million and $

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

As of December 31, 2019, the annual repayment requirements for debt obligations are as follows:

As of December 31, 2018, short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included $


million of commercial paper, short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of the company’s subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was

0.74

% at December 31, 2018. No such borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2019. In addition to available borrowings under the company’s revolving credit agreements, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $


million as of December 31, 2019. These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.

Credit Facilities

The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $

2.50

billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The facility expires in July 2021. The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of

3.5

:1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of

3.0

:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2019,

no

borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $


million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.

Commercial Paper Programs

The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed


days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed


days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs.

Senior Notes

Interest on the floating rate senior notes is payable quarterly. Interest is payable annually on the other euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes.

Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest.

The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.

In 2019, the company refinanced certain of its debt by issuing new senior notes and using the proceeds to redeem some of its existing senior notes. In connection with these redemptions, the company incurred $


million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in Other Expense, Net on the accompanying statement of income. Upon redemption of the senior notes, the company terminated the related fixed to floating rate interest rate swap arrangements and paid $


million, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. The company also terminated related

F-41

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements and received $


million, included in other investing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows.

In 2018, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 included in the table above. This subsidiary has no independent function other than financing activities. The Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company and no other subsidiaries of the company have guaranteed the obligations.

Interest Rate Swap Arrangements

The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amount of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the note. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate. The variable interest rates reset monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges of the notes. See Note 14 for additional information on the interest rate swap arrangements and related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. The following table summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap arrangements on the company's senior notes at December 31, 2019:

(a)

The payments on $


million notional value of these interest rate swaps are offset in part by cross-currency interest rate swaps which effectively reduced the pay rate as of December 31, 2019 from a weighted average of

3.50

% to a weighted average of

1.14

%.

The company entered into $


million notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert a portion of the semi-annual payments related to the variable rate, U.S. dollar denominated, LIBOR-based interest rate swaps to payments on variable rate, euro denominated, EURIBOR-based cross-currency interest rate swaps.

Note 11. Leases

As a lessee, the company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. These operating leases generally have remaining lease terms between


month and


years, and some include options to extend (generally for


to


years) or have options to terminate the arrangement within


year. The company’s finance leases are not material.

The company has guaranteed the residual value of three leased operating facilities with lease terms ending in 2020, 2023 and 2024. The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 10). The aggregate maximum guarantee under these three lease arrangements is $


million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities for these lease arrangements are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019, but exclude any amounts for residual value guarantees.

As a lessee, the consolidated statement of income includes pre-tax operating lease costs of $


million and pre-tax variable lease costs of $


million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Lease costs arising from finance leases, short-term leases, and sublease income are not material.

Cash used in operating activities for payments of amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $


million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating lease ROU assets of $


million were obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2019.

The weighted-average remaining operating lease term was

6.2

years and the weighted average discount rate was

4.0

% as of December 31, 2019.

ROU assets of $


million as of December 31, 2019, are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities of $


million and $


million as of December 31, 2019, are classified in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

As of December 31, 2019, future payments of operating lease liabilities are as follows:

As a lessor, operating leases, sales-type leases and direct financing leases are not material.

As previously disclosed in the company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and under previous lease accounting guidance, income from continuing operations includes expense from operating leases of $


million and $


million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the following is a summary of annual future minimum lease and rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018:

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies

Purchase Obligations

The company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount of the company’s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $

1.20

billion at December 31, 2019 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be settled during 2020.

Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments

Outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $


million at December 31, 2019.

Substantially all of these letters of credit and guarantees expire before 2026.

Outstanding surety bonds and other guarantees totaled $


million at December 31, 2019.

The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2022.

The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required.

The company is a guarantor of pension plan obligations of a divested business. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2019 was $


million.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations. However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where probable, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.

In connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of operations.

In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions.

Environmental Matters

The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including input from environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At December 31, 2019, the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $


million. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Litigation and Related Contingencies

There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible

F-44

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters

The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company’s continuing operations at December 31, 2019, was approximately $


million to $


million on an undiscounted basis. The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger. The company’s accrual for all such matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $


million at December 31, 2019 (or $


million undiscounted). The accrual includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $


million at December 31, 2019 (or $


million undiscounted) that are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger. In addition to the above accrual, as of December 31, 2019, the company had a product liability accrual of $


million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses.

The assets and liabilities assumed at the Fisher merger date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of

4.67

%). The discount on the liabilities of approximately $


million and the discount on the assets of approximately $


million (net discount $


million) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.

Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis.

Intellectual Property Matters

On June 3, 2013, Unisone Strategic IP filed a complaint against Life Technologies, a subsidiary of the company, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging patent infringement by Life Technologies’ supply chain management system software, which operates with product “supply centers” installed at customer sites. Plaintiff seeks damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On August 24, 2017, Unisone filed an appeal from a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) that found the challenged patent claims invalid. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the PTAB’s ruling finding the challenged claims in the Unisone patent invalid. Unisone had until March 11, 2019 to file an appeal with the United States Supreme Court. Unisone did not appeal that decision, and consequently the case before the United States District Court, which had been stayed pending the outcome of the PTAB decision, resumed with Unisone filing an amended complaint on September 12, 2019 regarding similar patent claims that were not included in the PTAB proceeding. On November 1, 2019, Life Technologies filed two additional covered business method (CBM) challenges with the PTAB regarding Unisone’s new patent claims. On December 16, 2019, the United States District Court granted Life Technologies’ motion to stay the case pending the PTAB’s decision whether to institute a CBM review of the new patent claims.

Note 13. Comprehensive Income and Shareholders' Equity

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income combines net income and other comprehensive items. Other comprehensive items represent certain amounts that are reported as components of shareholders’ equity in the accompanying balance sheet.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded an out of period adjustment to correct an error in the accounting for income taxes associated with the partial hedge of its net investment in a foreign operation in 2014 through the third quarter of 2017. The adjustment affected deferred income taxes and other comprehensive income and, in the aggregate, increased comprehensive income by $


million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The adjustment does not have any impact on the

company’s statements of income or cash flows. The company determined that the adjustment was not material to the consolidated financial statements for any previously reported annual or interim periods.

Changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net of tax are as follows:

Shareholders’ Equity

At December 31, 2019, the company had reserved


million unissued shares of its common stock for possible issuance under stock-based compensation plans.

Note 14. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair Value Measurements

The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2019. The company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of insurance contracts, investments in derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration.

The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.

Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.

Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data.

F-46

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The following tables present information about the company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:

The company uses the Black-Scholes model to value its warrants. The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.

The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Gains and losses recognized on currency exchange contracts and the interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges are included in the consolidated statement of income together with the corresponding, offsetting losses and gains on the underlying hedged transactions.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity.

See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies.

Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements

In 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to the completion of debt offerings. Based on the company's conclusion that the debt offerings were probable, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the interest payments on €

1.80

billion plus $


million aggregate principal amounts of the planned fixed-rate debt issues. The hedges were terminated in 2019, in connection with the debt offerings. The aggregate fair value of the hedges at that time, $


million, net of tax, has been classified as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive items and will be amortized to interest expense over the terms of the related debt issuances. The company had a cash outlay of $


million in 2019 associated with termination of the arrangements, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows.

The fair value of debt obligations was determined based on quoted market prices and on borrowing rates available to the company at the respective period ends which represent level 2 measurements.

Note 15. Supplemental Cash Flow Information

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash is included in the consolidated balance sheet as follows:

Amounts included in restricted cash represent funds held as collateral for bank guarantees and incoming cash in China awaiting government administrative clearance.

Note 16. Restructuring and Other Costs (Income), Net

Restructuring and other costs (income), net, in 2019 primarily included the gain on the sale of the company’s Anatomical Pathology business, and, to a lesser extent, transaction/integration costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture; sales of inventory revalued at the date of acquisition; and continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S. and Europe. In 2019, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately


% of the company’s workforce.

Restructuring and other costs in 2018 included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S. and Europe; third-party transaction/integration costs primarily related to recent acquisitions; sales of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; and environmental remediation charges. These charges were partially offset by gains on sales of real estate and favorable results of litigation. In 2018, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately


% of the company’s workforce.
