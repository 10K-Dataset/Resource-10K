Raw Materials

Our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources. We do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business.

Raw-material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results.

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks

Patents are important in all segments of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts.

We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to patents and know-how.

Seasonal Influences

Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of flu season. Sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of airborne pollen allergens.

Working Capital Requirements

There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital.

Dependency on a Single Customer

There is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. No customer accounted for more than 5% of our total revenues in any of the past three years.

Government Contracts

Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results.

Competition

The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors. In general, competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors:

·

technical performance and advances in technology that result in new products and improved price/performance ratios;

·

product differentiation, availability and reliability;

·

the depth of our capabilities;

·

our reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and services;

·

customer service and support;

·

active research and application-development programs; and

·

relative prices of our products and services.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.

In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.

A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures.

Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey, facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984. Our Rockford, Illinois, facility is subject to a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action program administered by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. We are required to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site.

Financial Statement Index



THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Business (continued)

We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $29 million at December 31, 2013. The liability for environmental matters associated with Fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value.

These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result, we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our recently acquired Life Technologies subsidiary also has certain environmental liabilities, including from its prior acquisitions, such as obligations for the clean-up of formerly-owned locations as well as several hazardous waste sites under state and federal environmental laws, in connection with its acquisitions of Dexter Corporation in 2000 and Applied Biosystems in 2008. Life Technologies has reserves accrued for these matters. Unexpected results related to the investigation and clean-up of any of these sites could cause our financial exposure in these matters to exceed stated reserves, requiring us to allocate additional funds and other resources to address these environmental liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Regulatory Affairs

Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Food and Drug Administration, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.

We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 4.

We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.

Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.

Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.

It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.

Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:

•  continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of

our depth in product offerings.

We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.

Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.

Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of:

•  creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds.

Risk Factors

(continued)

As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.

International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2012, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $227 million on the revenues of our continuing operations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services, and in 2013, currency translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $36 million.

Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility and the term credit facility that we entered into to partially finance the Life Technologies Acquisition include a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio and an interest coverage ratio. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under either facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under either facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the revolving credit facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 5.5 to 1.0 during the first six months after the closing date of the Life Technologies Acquisition (which was February 3, 2014) and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, after 18 months or the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense) to be less than 3.0 to 1.0.

Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.

Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.

Overview

The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into three business segments (see Note 3): Analytical Technologies, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services.

Recent and Pending Acquisitions and Divestitures

The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2012 and its 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The company’s principal 2012 acquisitions are described below.

·

One Lambda, a provider of transplant diagnostics, was acquired in September 2012 to enhance the company’s presence in specialty

in vitro

diagnostics and to increase access to the transplant diagnostics market.

·

Doe & Ingalls, a channel for specialty production chemicals and provider of customized supply-chain services to the life sciences and microelectronics industries, was acquired in May 2012 to expand the company’s products and services that address the production market.

In addition, on April 14, 2013, the company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Life Technologies providing for the acquisition of Life Technologies by the company (the “Life Technologies Acquisition”) at a price of approximately $13.6 billion in cash ($76.1311786 per share), plus the assumption of certain Life Technologies indebtedness (Note 2). Life Technologies provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing. Life Technologies’ revenues totaled $3.9 billion in 2013. The acquisition was completed on February 3, 2014. Life Technologies will be reported in a new segment, Life Sciences Solutions, together with most of the company’s existing biosciences businesses.

The company completed its permanent financing arrangements for the Life Technologies Acquisition in December 2013. The financing consists of a term loan agreement (the “Term Credit Facility”), proceeds from issuance of senior debt and commercial paper, proceeds from equity forward agreements and cash on hand. These arrangements are discussed below under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.

In December 2013, the company entered an agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare for approximately $1.06 billion. The businesses fall principally in the Analytical Technologies segment. Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies Acquisition. As of December 31, 2013, the agreement to sell the businesses was contingent on, among other things, obtaining antitrust approval for the acquisition of Life Technologies. That approval was obtained in January 2014 at which time these businesses were designated as held for sale. Revenues and operating income in 2013 of the businesses to be sold were approximately $250 million and $80 million, respectively. The sale is subject to additional regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity

In February 2013, in connection with a change in management responsibility for two product lines with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $100 million, the company transferred its water analysis and research serum and media product lines to the Laboratory Products and Services segment from the Analytical Technologies segment. The company has historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect these transfers.

Sales in 2013 were $13.09 billion, an increase of $580 million from 2012. Sales increased $188 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $36 million in 2013. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $429 million (3%) primarily due to increased demand offset in part by modestly lower sales to customers in academic and government markets which the company believes was due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. Sales remained strong to customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries while sales to customers in industrial markets grew modestly. Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America.

In 2013, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, compared with $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, in 2012. The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions. The increase was offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, $24 million of higher acquisition-related charges in 2013, an increase in amortization expense of $16 million in 2013 primarily related to the acquisitions of One Lambda and Doe & Ingalls and imposition of a medical device excise tax in 2013. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.

The company’s effective tax rates were 3.1% and 0.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $230 million and $331 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Tax payments decreased in 2013 due primarily to refunds of taxes paid in 2012. In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress’ renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S. The tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points. The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements. The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2014 will be between 2% and 5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax credit for research and development activities has not been extended by the U.S. Congress as of February 26, 2014.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:

(a)

Accounts Receivable

The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $54 million at December 31, 2013. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations (continued)

As of February 27, 2014, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $50 million in 2014 and expects to identify additional actions during 2014, including some related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2013 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2013 and, to a greater extent, in 2014, including $35 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2012 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $85 million beginning in part in 2012 and to a greater extent in 2013, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

The company expects significant restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2014 in connection with the acceleration of certain equity awards held by Life Technologies’ employees and severance obligations payable to former Life Technologies’ executives.

Segment Results

The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $107 million to $4.13 billion in 2013. Sales increased $123 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $9 million due to acquisitions. These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $25 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments as well as bioscience products, offset in part by lower sales of chemical analysis products which the company believes were affected by macro economic conditions facing customers in industrial markets.

Operating income margin was 18.6% in 2013 compared to 18.6% in 2012. Operating margin was favorably affected by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.

Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $229 million to $3.19 billion in 2013. Sales increased $143 million due to an acquisition and $92 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $5 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand, particularly for clinical diagnostics products and, to a lesser extent, microbiology and allergy products in part as a result of strong flu and pollen seasons, partially offset by weakness from reduced healthcare utilization and lower sales of instruments to diagnostic laboratories due in part to lower healthcare reimbursement rates in the U.S. for anatomical pathology tests.

Operating income margin was 27.2% in 2013 and 25.7% in 2012. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales from an acquisition and, to a lesser extent, at existing businesses as well as productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. The increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and imposition of the medical device excise tax in 2013.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $297 million to $6.35 billion in 2013. Sales increased $267 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $36 million due to an acquisition. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $6 million in 2013. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for laboratory products and clinical trial logistics services. Sales of laboratory equipment increased only modestly due to weakness in demand from customers in academic and government markets.

Operating income margin was 14.5% in 2013 and 14.4% in 2012. The increase was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, price increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.

Other Expense, Net

The company reported other expense, net, of $290 million and $213 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively (Note 4). In the first quarter of 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million. In 2013, other items, net also includes $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the Life Technologies Acquisition, offset in part by gains totaling $5 million from sales of equity investments. Interest expense increased $21 million primarily due to the debt issued to fund the One Lambda and Life Technologies acquisitions.

Provision for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rates were 3.1% and 0.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $230 million and $331 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Tax payments decreased in 2013 due primarily to refunds of taxes paid in 2012. In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress’ renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S. The tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points. The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements. The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2014 will be between 2% and 5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax credit for research and development activities has not been extended by the U.S. Congress as of February 26, 2014.

The company has operations and a taxable presence in nearly 50 countries outside of the U.S. All of these countries except three have a lower tax rate than the U.S. The countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the U.S. include Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.

Discontinued Operations

On June 22, 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, the company’s senior management made a decision to pursue a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The company completed the sale in October 2012 for nominal proceeds. Revenues of the laboratory workstations business were $147 million in the 2012 period prior to the sale. The business incurred a pre-tax loss of $30 million in 2012 due to inventory write-offs, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring and other transition costs associated with relocation of the business. In 2012, the company recorded after-tax charges aggregating $63 million as the loss on the divestiture. The loss in 2013 for discontinued operations primarily represents a charge for the cost of razing abandoned facilities of the business prior to sale of the land. The results of the laboratory workstations business have been included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance which requires disclosure of information about significant reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. This guidance became effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard, which is related to disclosure only, did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Financial Statement Index



THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations (continued)

In July 2012, the FASB modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The revised standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. This guidance became effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2011, the FASB issued new guidance which requires enhanced disclosures on offsetting amounts within the balance sheet, including disclosing gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset or subject to a master netting or similar agreement. This guidance became effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard, which is related to disclosure only, did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Contingent Liabilities

The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An outcome that differs materially from current reserve estimates for one or more of the matters described in Note 10 or Item 3 of this Form 10-K could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.

2012 Compared With 2011

Continuing Operations

Sales in 2012 were $12.51 billion, an increase of $951 million from 2011. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and, higher sales at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $403 million (3%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including $474 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $156 million due to other acquisitions, net of divestitures, offset in part by $227 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The pro forma increase in revenues was primarily due to increased demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia and moderate in North America and Europe. Demand from customers in academic and government markets slowed such that growth was nominal in 2012 and demand from customers in industrial markets slowed such that growth was nominal in the second half of 2012.

In 2012, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, compared with $1.25 billion and 10.8%, respectively, in 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and $84 million of lower acquisition-related charges in 2012. The increase was offset in part by strategic growth investments and an increase in amortization expense of $100 million in 2012, primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex.

In 2012, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $150 million, including $56 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $13 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of transaction costs related to the acquisition of One Lambda. The company incurred $67 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the consolidation of several facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, real estate writedowns related to facility consolidations partially offset by a $6 million gain from the settlement of pre-acquisition litigation.

THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations (continued)

In 2011, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $231 million, including $73 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $62 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Dionex and Phadia. The company incurred $81 million of cash restructuring costs, including $21 million of cash compensation from monetizing equity awards held by Dionex employees at the date of acquisition. The cash costs also include continuing costs associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, a loss on sale of a heating equipment business.

The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2011 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2011 and to a greater extent in 2012, including $30 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $15 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $278 million to $4.02 billion in 2012. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Dionex, and higher revenue at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Had Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $104 million (3%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including an increase of $183 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $2 million due to acquisitions, net of a disposition, offset in part by $81 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The pro forma increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand across the segment’s range of analytical instruments and for bioscience products, offset in part by lower sales to customers in academic and government markets.

Operating income margin was 18.6% in both 2012 and 2011. Profit from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, from incremental sales at existing businesses was substantially offset by higher spending on commercial initiatives and unfavorable currency translation.

Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $492 million to $2.96 billion in 2012. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia, and higher revenue at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $118 million (4%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including increases of $103 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $80 million due to other acquisitions, offset in part by $65 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The pro forma increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for clinical diagnostic products and, to a lesser extent, microbiology products.

Operating income margin was 25.7% in 2012 and 24.2% in 2011. The increase resulted primarily from the accretive Phadia acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and profit on incremental sales at existing businesses. The increases were offset in part by higher spending on commercial initiatives.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $223 million to $6.05 billion in 2012. Sales increased $74 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $89 million in 2012. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $238 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand for laboratory consumables and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial logistics services. The increase in demand was offset in part by lower sales of laboratory equipment, particularly to customers in academic and government markets.

Operating income margin was 14.4% in 2012 and 14.3% in 2011. The increase resulted from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by lower sales of higher margin laboratory equipment and higher spending on commercial initiatives.

Other Expense, Net

The company reported other expense, net, of $213 million and $118 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $66 million in interest expense related to the debt issued to fund the Phadia and Dionex acquisitions. In 2011, other items, net included a $28 million gain on currency exchange contracts associated with the Phadia acquisition and repayment of its multi-currency debt and an $18 million gain on the sale of an investment accounted for under the cost method, offset in part by $10 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments to fund the Phadia acquisition.

Results of Operations (continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Consolidated working capital was $6.75 billion at December 31, 2013, compared with $2.74 billion at December 31, 2012. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.83 billion at December 31, 2013 and $810 million at December 31, 2012. The increase in working capital is primarily due to the issuance of $3.20 billion of long-term debt to fund the acquisition of Life Technologies and, to a lesser extent, earnings before amortization and depreciation and proceeds from the issuance of the company’s common stock under employees’ stock plans, offset in part by the payment of dividends and the repurchase of the company’s common stock.


Cash provided by operating activities was $2.01 billion during 2013. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $148 million and $72 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. A decrease in other assets provided cash of $169 million primarily due to the timing of income tax refunds. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $47 million, primarily due to higher inventory purchases. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $163 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. In 2013, the company paid fees to obtain bridge financing commitments and other transaction costs totaling $108 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $38 million during 2013. Cash payments for income taxes of continuing operations decreased to $230 million during 2013, compared with $331 million in the prior year, primarily related to refunds due from 2012. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $69 million during 2013.

The company’s financing activities used $918 million of cash during 2012, principally for the repurchase of $1.15 billion of the company’s common stock and to reduce commercial paper obligations by $849 million, offset in part by the issuance of $1.3 billion in senior notes. The company’s financing activities in 2012 also included the repayment of $355 million of long-term debt and the receipt of $254 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Cash dividend payments totaled $142 million during 2012.


Cash provided by operating activities was $1.69 billion during 2011.

The company’s financing activities provided $3.55 billion of cash during 2011, principally $5.15 billion from the issuance of debt to fund acquisitions, offset in part by the repurchase of $1.34 billion of the company’s common stock.

Following issuance of a redemption notice for the remaining $329 million principal outstanding of the company’s 3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024, all of the balance was converted or redeemed for a total cash outlay of $452 million. The company’s financing activities in 2011 also included $158 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2011 - 2013 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, a build-to-suit lease arrangement entered in 2012, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $4.8 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold.

A guarantee of residual value under a build-to-suit lease arrangement for a facility that will be leased upon completion of construction has not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. Upon completion of construction in 2014, a five-year lease will commence with options to purchase the facility or renew the lease for up to three 5-year terms. The residual value guarantee becomes operative at the end of the lease for up to a maximum of $58 million.

In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.

The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Australian dollars and Swedish krona. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.

Interest Rates

The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2013, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2013 was $10.60 billion (see Note 12). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2013 would increase by approximately $523 million. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2013 would decrease by approximately $482 million.

In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100-basis -point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2013 would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $9 million.

Currency Exchange Rates

The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Swedish krona, euro, British pounds sterling, Danish krone and Canadian dollars. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2013 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $758 million.

Financial Statement Index



THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

(continued)

The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2013 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $85 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2013 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $85 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.

Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2013 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $16 million on the company’s net income.

Controls and Procedures

Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2013. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2013, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management, including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, the company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, as stated in their report that appears on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To

the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing at Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.         Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by providing analytical instruments, equipment, reagents and consumables, software and services for research, manufacturing, analysis, discovery and diagnostics. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, universities, research institutions and government agencies, as well as environmental and industrial process control settings.

Principles of Consolidation

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue is recognized after all significant obligations have been met, collectability is probable and title has passed, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery or completion of services. If customer-specific acceptance criteria exist, the company recognizes revenue after demonstrating adherence to the acceptance criteria. The company recognizes revenue and related costs for arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as equipment and installation, as each element is delivered or completed based upon its relative fair value. When a portion of the customer’s payment is not due until installation or other deliverable occurs, the company defers that portion of the revenue until completion of installation or transfer of the deliverable. Provisions for discounts, warranties, rebates to customers, returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales taxes, value-added taxes and certain excise taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenue.

The company recognizes revenue from the sale of software. License fee revenues relate primarily to sales of perpetual licenses to end-users and are recognized when a formal agreement exists, the license fee is fixed and determinable, delivery of the software has occurred and collection is probable. Software arrangements with customers often include multiple elements, including software products, maintenance and support. The company recognizes software license fees based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for such undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, which is generally a period of one year. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately.

Warranty Obligations

The company provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of product revenues at the time product revenue is recognized. While the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs or supplier warranties on parts differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Extended warranty agreements are considered service contracts which are discussed above. Costs of service contracts are recognized as incurred. The changes in the carrying amount of warranty obligations are as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Research and Development

The company conducts research and development activities to increase its depth of capabilities in technologies, software and services. Research and development costs include salaries and benefits, consultants, facilities related costs, material costs, depreciation and travel. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

The company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return.

The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money (Note 7).

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share has been computed using the treasury stock method for the convertible obligations, equity forward agreements and outstanding stock options and restricted units, as well as their related income tax effects (Note 8).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

Investments

The company’s marketable equity and debt securities that are part of its cash management activities are considered short-term investments in the accompanying balance sheet. Such securities principally represent available-for-sale investments. In addition, the company owns marketable equity securities that represent less than

20% ownership and for which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence. Such investments are also considered available-for-sale. All available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value, with the difference between cost and fair market value, net of related tax effects, recorded in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity (Notes 11 and 12). Decreases in fair market values of individual securities below cost are reviewed to determine if the unrealized loss is other than temporary. Decreases below cost for a duration of six to nine months are deemed indicative of other than temporary impairment, and the company assesses the need to write down the carrying amount of the investments to fair market value through other expense, net, in the accompanying statement of income. Should a decrease in the fair market value of debt securities be deemed attributable to non-credit loss conditions, however, no impairment is recorded in the statement of income if the company has the ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity.

Other investments for which there are not readily determinable market values are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, which provides that they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the company had cost method investments with carrying amounts of $13.7 million and $12.2 million, respectively, which are included in other assets.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined principally by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method with certain of the company’s businesses utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company assesses the carrying value of this inventory based on a lower of cost or market analysis. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income. The components of inventories are as follows:

The company recorded a reduction in cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories of $0.1 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment (including software), 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property, plant and equipment consists of the following:

Acquisition-related Intangible Assets

Acquisition-related intangible assets include the costs of acquired customer relationships, product technology, patents, tradenames and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 20 years. In addition, the company has tradenames and in-process research and development that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. The company reviews intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired. Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows:

Other Assets

Other assets in the accompanying balance sheet include deferred tax assets, investments in joint ventures, cash surrender value of life insurance, deferred debt issuance costs, insurance recovery receivables related to product liability matters, pension assets, cost-method investments, notes receivable, capitalized catalog costs and other assets.

The company owns

49% -

50% non-controlling interests in two joint ventures and records its pro rata share of the joint ventures’ results in other expense, net, in the accompanying statement of income, using the equity method of accounting. The joint ventures were formed to combine the company’s capabilities with those of businesses contributed by the respective joint venture partners in the fields of integrated response technology services and disposable laboratory glass products. The results of the joint ventures were not material for any period presented. The company made purchases of products for resale from the glass products joint venture totaling $46.6 million, $48.3 million and $45.1 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Goodwill

The company assesses the realizability of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company’s reporting units. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. When an impairment is indicated, any excess of carrying value over the implied fair value of goodwill is recorded as an operating loss. The company completed annual tests for impairment at November 1, 2013 and November 2, 2012, and determined that goodwill was not impaired.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Asset Retirement Obligations

The company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation is conditional on a future event, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash outflow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as interest expense. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the company had recorded asset retirement obligations of $28.2 million and $28.3 million, respectively, which are primarily included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet.

Loss Contingencies

Accruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at their fair value and, as such, were discounted to their present value at the dates of acquisition.

Advertising

The company records advertising costs as expenses as incurred, except for certain direct-response advertising, which is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected period of future benefit,

generally one to three years. The company has capitalized advertising costs of $4.4 million and $1.9 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Direct-response advertising consists of external catalog production and mailing costs, and amortization begins on the date the catalogs are first mailed. Advertising expense, which includes amortization of capitalized direct-response advertising, as described above, was $33.2 million, $39.5 million and $29.6 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Included in advertising expense was catalog amortization of $4.1 million, $5.6 million and $7.2 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities of the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were net losses of $16.6 million, $11.0 million and $1.0 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Derivative Contracts

The company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.

The company uses short-term forward and option currency-exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. These contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Australian dollars, and Swedish krona. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. As of December 31, 2013, the company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts that were hedging anticipated purchases or sales.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Cash flow hedges.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the company had no outstanding derivative contracts that were accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Fair value hedges.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings. During 2011 and 2013, in connection with new debt issuances, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements. The company includes the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate debt) in the same line item (interest expense) as the offsetting effective portion of the loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates were made in estimating future cash flows to assess potential impairment of assets, and in determining the ultimate loss from selling discontinued operations and abandoning leases at facilities being exited (Note 14). Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance which requires disclosure of information about significant reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. This guidance became effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard, which is related to disclosure only, did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2012, the FASB modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The revised standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. This guidance became effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2011, the FASB issued new guidance which requires enhanced disclosures on offsetting amounts within the balance sheet, including disclosing gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset or subject to a master netting or similar agreement. This guidance became effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard, which is related to disclosure only, did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 2.            Acquisitions and Dispositions

The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products.

Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The net assets acquired have been recorded based on estimates of fair value.

On April 14, 2013, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Life Technologies Corporation for approximately $13.6 billion, plus the assumption of net debt at close ($1.5 billion) (the “Life Technologies Acquisition”). The transaction closed on February 3, 2014. Life Technologies provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing. Life Technologies’ revenues totaled $3.9 billion in 2013. The acquisition of Life Technologies extends customer reach and broadens the company’s offerings in biosciences; genetic, medical and applied sciences; and bioproduction. At the time that the company agreed to acquire Life Technologies, it entered into a bridge credit agreement and a term loan agreement (Note 9). The bridge credit agreement expired in December 2013 upon arrangement of permanent financing. The term loan agreement is a 3-year unsecured $

5 billion term loan facility under which the company borrowed $5.00 billion in January 2014. In December 2013, the company issued $3.20 billion of senior notes (Note 9) and in January and February 2014, the company issued 34.9 million shares of its common stock for proceeds of $2.94 billion through equity forward arrangements (Note 11) to partially fund the acquisition. Beginning on the acquisition date, Life Technologies will be reported in a new segment, Life Sciences Solutions, together with most of the company’s existing biosciences businesses. The purchase price allocation for the acquisition and pro forma financial information are not yet available.

During 2013, the company made contingent purchase price and post closing adjustment payments totaling $40 million for acquisitions completed prior to 2013. The contingent purchase price payments were contractually due to the sellers upon achievement of certain performance criteria at the acquired businesses.


In September 2012, the Specialty Diagnostics segment acquired One Lambda, a provider of transplant diagnostics, for approximately $885 million, net of cash acquired, including related real estate and subject to a post-closing adjustment, plus up to $25 million of additional contingent consideration based upon the achievement of specified operating results in the year following the acquisition. The company recorded $13 million as the fair value of contingent consideration at the acquisition date and an additional $12 million as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense in 2013. The $25 million contingent purchase price obligation was paid in 2013. The acquisition of One Lambda enhances the segment’s presence in specialty

in vitro

diagnostics and adds new capabilities to the company’s transplant-testing workflow. Revenues of One Lambda were $182 million in 2011. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $274 million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.

In May 2012, the Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired Doe & Ingalls Management, LLC, a North Carolina-based channel for specialty production chemicals and provider of customized supply-chain services to the life sciences and microelectronics industries, for $175 million. The acquisition expands the segment’s products and services that address the production market. Revenues of Doe & Ingalls totaled approximately $110 million in 2011. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $81 million was allocated to goodwill, $53 million of which is tax deductible.

In addition, in 2012, the Analytical Technologies segment acquired a manufacturer and supplier of radioactive isotope identifiers, x-ray and gamma-ray detectors and spectroscopy systems used to detect radioactive and other nuclear materials in security and environmental settings and a manufacturer of miniature NMR spectrometers. The Specialty Diagnostics segment acquired a business that holds proprietary technology for tests to diagnose pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions was $25 million plus contingent consideration of up to $15 million.

In August 2011, the Specialty Diagnostics segment completed the acquisition of the Phadia group, a global leader in allergy and autoimmunity diagnostics, headquartered in Sweden, for a total purchase price of $3.54 billion, net of cash acquired, including the repayment of $2.14 billion of indebtedness owed by Phadia to the seller and third-party lenders. Phadia develops, manufactures and markets complete blood-test systems to support the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of allergy and autoimmune diseases. Phadia has been a pioneer in bringing new allergy diagnostic tests to market and is a global leader for

in vitro

allergy diagnostics and a European leader in autoimmunity diagnostics. Phadia’s revenues in 2010 totaled €367 million (approximately $525 million based on exchange rates at the time of the acquisition agreement announcement). The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $1.81 billion was recorded as goodwill, substantially none of which is tax deductible.

In May 2011, the Analytical Technologies segment completed the acquisition of Dionex Corporation, a leading manufacturer and marketer of chromatography systems, for a total purchase price of $2.03 billion, net of cash acquired. Dionex, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, is a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of ion and liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems, consumables, and software for chemical analysis. Dionex systems are used worldwide in environmental analysis and by the life sciences, chemical, petrochemical, food and beverage, power generation, and electronics industries. Their expertise in applications and instrumentation helps analytical scientists to evaluate and develop pharmaceuticals, establish environmental regulations, and produce better industrial products. Revenues of Dionex totaled $420 million in its fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $1.32 billion was recorded as goodwill, substantially none of which is tax deductible.

In addition, in 2011, the Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired a U.S.-based manufacturer of clinical and diagnostic assays and platforms for rapid and sensitive protein biomarker analysis; a U.K.-based provider of single-use plastic products serving the microbiology, life sciences and clinical markets and certain operating assets of a Singapore-based distributor of laboratory equipment and consumables. The Specialty Diagnostics segment also acquired a provider of microbiology solutions, including blood culture identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing products with operations in both the U.S. and U.K. The aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions was $97 million, net of cash acquired. Separately, the company’s discontinued operations acquired a manufacturer of laboratory workstations and fume hoods for $8 million.

The company made contingent purchase price and post closing adjustment payments totaling $35 million in 2011, for acquisitions completed prior to 2011. The contingent purchase price payments were contractually due to the sellers upon achievement of certain performance criteria at the acquired businesses.

Dispositions

In December 2013, the company entered an agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare for approximately $1.06 billion. The businesses fall principally in the Analytical Technologies segment. Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies Acquisition. As of December 31, 2013, the agreement to sell the businesses was contingent on, among other things, obtaining antitrust approval for the acquisition of Life Technologies. That approval was obtained in January 2014 at which time these businesses were designated as held for sale. Revenues and operating income in 2013 of the businesses to be sold were approximately $250 million and $80 million, respectively. The sale is subject to additional regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

The assets and liabilities of the businesses to be sold were as follows at December 31, 2013:

Note 5.

Stock-based Compensation Expense

The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors or for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vestings. Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder’s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).

Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier.

The company has elected to recognize any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in capital in excess of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company. The company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes. Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess of par value on the accompanying balance sheet were $46.6 million, $18.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively, in 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Stock Options

The company’s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value. Options vest over 3-5 years with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions. Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions. The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company’s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:

The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $19.84, $15.36 and $15.79, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $189.8 million, $125.4 million and $85.3 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option.

A summary of the company’s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 is presented below:

(a)

Market price per share on December 31, 2013 was $111.35. The intrinsic value is zero for options with exercise prices above the market price.

As of December 31, 2013, there was $63 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2017 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.2 years.

Restricted Share/Unit Awards

Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The awards generally vest over 3-4 years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions. The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to receive dividend equivalents. The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company’s shares on the grant date. For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.

As of December 31, 2013, there was $65 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock unit awards. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2017 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.0 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company. Shares may be purchased under the program at

95% of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period. Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to

10% of each participating employee’s gross wages. The company issued 100,000, 151,000 and 139,000 shares, respectively, of its common stock for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 plan years, which ended on December 31.

Note 6.          Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans

The company’s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the company charged to expense $87.3 million, $86.0 million and $79.4 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Employees of a number of the company’s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis.

The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.

When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.

The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the company made cash contributions of approximately $38.2 million, $23.3 million and $25.3 million, respectively. Additionally, in 2013 the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans. Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $30 and $40 million for 2014.

Domestic Pension Plan Assets

The company’s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates. The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility. The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities. The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than

2% of invested assets) of private equity investments. The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately

25% to funds investing in U.S. equities, including a sub-allocation of approximately

5% to real estate-related equities, approximately

15% to funds investing in international equities and approximately

60% to funds investing in fixed income securities. The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

Non-U.S. Pension Plan Assets

The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S. The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans. Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies. When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers. For plans not currently managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments are substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income securities with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately

55% -

70% for equities and

30% -

45% for fixed income securities. For plans managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments also include hedge funds, multi-asset funds and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 3% - 10% for equities, 40% - 55% for fixed income, 15% - 28% for hedge funds, 2% - 5% for multi-asset funds and 18% - 22% for funds holding derivatives. The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions. Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

The tables above present the fair value of the company’s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12). Certain pension plan assets are measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company’s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions. The fair value of the company’s private equity investments, which are classified as level 3 investments, are based on valuations provided by the respective funds. There was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension plan assets during the years presented.

In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2013. In addition, the impact of tax law changes in certain foreign jurisdictions reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2013. The impact of change in tax laws and apportionment on deferred taxes in 2012 includes $

Credit Facilities

In 2013, the company entered a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $

1.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The facility expires in July 2018.

The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenant requires the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) below

3.5 to 1.0 prior to the closing date of the Life Technologies Acquisition, below

5.5 to 1.0 during the first six months after the closing date of the Life Technologies Acquisition and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to

3.5 to 1.0, after 18 months and an Interest Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) to interest expense below

3.0 to 1.0. The credit agreement permits the company to use the facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate purposes. The credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper ($250 million at December 31, 2013) to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $43 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.

Commercial Paper Program

The company has a U.S. commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and the CP Notes rank pari passu with all of the company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. CP Notes are issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of December 31, 2013, outstanding borrowings under this program were $250 million, with a weighted average remaining period to maturity of 12 days. The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding CP Notes as of December 31, 2013 was 0.47%.

Term Loan

In connection with the planned acquisition of Life Technologies, the company entered into a bridge credit agreement and a term loan agreement. The bridge credit agreement was a 364-day unsecured committed bridge facility which was terminated in December 2013 by the company upon securing long-term financing for the acquisition. The term loan agreement is a 3-year unsecured $5 billion term loan facility. In January 2014, the company borrowed $5.00 billion under the term loan facility to partially fund the acquisition. The term loan agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The term loan agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenants require the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) below 5.5 to 1.0 during the first six months after the borrowing date and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, beginning 18 months after the borrowing date. The company must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0.

Senior Notes

Interest on each of the senior notes is payable semi-annually.

Each of the notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.

Interest Rate Swap Arrangements

In December 2013, upon the issuance of $900 million principal amount of 1.30% Senior Notes due 2017, the company entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amount of the swaps is equal to the principal amount of the 1.30% Notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the payment dates of the 1.30% Notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.6616% (0.83% at December 31, 2013) and to receive a fixed rate of 1.30%. The variable interest rate resets monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as a fair value hedge of the 1.30% Notes. See Note 12 for additional information.

In August 2011, the company terminated its fixed to floating rate swap arrangements on its 2.15% Senior Notes due 2012, 2.05% Senior Notes due 2014, 3.25% Senior Notes due 2014 and 3.20% Senior Notes due 2015. These swap arrangements were accounted for as fair value hedges. As a result of terminating these arrangements, the company received $63 million (excluding accrued interest) in cash. The proceeds were recorded as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt, which will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective debt instruments.

Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements

In 2013, prior to issuing the 4.15% Senior Notes due 2024, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering. Based on the company’s conclusion that a debt offering was probable as a result of near-term debt maturities and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $700 million of principal amount of the planned 10-year fixed-rate debt issue. In December 2013, the company issued senior notes and terminated the swap arrangements. The company received $11 million at the termination of these agreements and recorded a gain of $1 million on the ineffective portion in other expense, net in the accompanying statement of income. The remaining favorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination (the effective portion) was $6 million, net of tax, and was classified as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholder’s equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2024.

In 2011, prior to issuing the 3.60% Senior Notes due 2021, the company entered into hedging agreements (treasury locks) with several banks to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering. Based on the company’s conclusion that a debt offering was probable and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year term, the agreements hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $850 million of principal amount of the 10-year fixed rate debt issue (or subsequent financings of such debt).

The company paid $59 million at the termination of this agreement. The unfavorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination was $37 million, net of tax, and was classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholders’ equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2021.

3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024

During the first quarter of 2011 following issuance of a redemption notice by the company, holders of the company’s 3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024 exercised conversion rights for substantially all of the remaining $329 million principal outstanding. The balance not converted by holders was redeemed by the company. The company paid the principal and the premium due upon conversion/redemption in cash for a total outlay of $452 million. The premium was charged to capital in excess of par value when paid.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.

In connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of operations.

In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Shareholders’ Equity

At December 31, 2013, the company had reserved 43,640,460 unissued shares of its common stock for possible issuance under stock-based compensation plans.

The company has 50,000 shares of authorized but unissued $100 par value preferred stock.

Shareholder Rights Plan

The company has distributed rights under a shareholder rights plan adopted by the company’s Board of Directors to holders of outstanding shares of the company’s common stock. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one hundred-thousandth of a share (a Unit) of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $100 par value, at a purchase price of $200 per Unit, subject to adjustment. The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person) has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (the Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii) 10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock.

In the event that a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, except pursuant to an offer for all outstanding shares of common stock that at least 75% of the Board of Directors determines to be fair to, and otherwise in the best interests of, stockholders, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock (or, in certain circumstances, units of preferred stock, cash, property or other securities of the company) which equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of the common stock. In the event that, at any time after any person has become an Acquiring Person, (i) the company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the company is not the surviving corporation or its common stock is changed or exchanged (other than a merger that follows an offer approved by the Board of Directors), or (ii) 50% or more of the company’s assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of such common stock.

At any time until the Stock Acquisition Date, the company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right (payable in cash or stock). The rights expire on September 29, 2015, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged.

Equity Forward Agreements

In June 2013, in anticipation of the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company entered into equity forward agreements in connection with a public offering of 29.6 million shares of its common stock. The use of the equity forward agreements substantially eliminated future equity market price risk by fixing a common equity offering sales price under the then existing market conditions, while mitigating share dilution from the offering by postponing the actual issuance of common stock until the funds were needed for the Life Technologies Acquisition.

Under the terms of the agreements, the counterparties borrowed shares of the company’s common stock and sold them for $85.50 per share. Upon settlement of the agreements, in January 2014, the company issued and delivered 29.6 million shares of its common stock at the then applicable forward sale price of $82.5342 per share. The forward price was initially $83.2770 per share, net of underwriting fees, and was subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the agreements including fixed reductions related to cash dividends.

In November 2013, the company entered into a subscription agreement for a private placement of 5.3 million shares of its common stock at a price of $94.85 per share that was contingent on the closing of the Life Technologies Acquisition. The agreement closed on February 3, 2014.

Financial Statement Index

F-45


THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The equity forward and subscription agreements had no initial fair value as they were entered into at the then market price of the common stock. The company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock until the agreements were settled in 2014. Upon settlement, the proceeds were recorded in equity. Prior to their settlement, to the extent that the equity forward agreements were dilutive, they have been reflected in the company’s diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Prior to closing, the subscription agreement was not potentially dilutive to the company’s diluted earnings per share calculations due to its contingent nature.

The cost of available-for-sale investments that were sold was based on specific identification in determining realized gains and losses recorded in the accompanying statement of income. In 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million. Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments were nominal in 2013, 2012 and 2011.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of the auction rate securities by obtaining indications of value from brokers/dealers. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on assessment of the probability that the company would be required to make such future payment. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.

Note 14.       Restructuring and Other Costs, Net

Restructuring and other costs in 2013 and 2012 primarily included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company’s 2013 and 2012 severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 3% of the company’s workforce in both years.

Restructuring and other costs in 2011 primarily included cash compensation from monetizing equity awards held by Dionex employees at the date of acquisition as well as continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the following: the consolidation of facilities in Finland and Australia of acquired businesses with existing facilities in those countries; the consolidation of facilities in the U.S.; and the restructuring of the commercial organization of a business across six European countries to increase productivity and efficiency in serving customers. The company’s 2011 severance actions affected approximately 4% of the company’s workforce.

As of February 27, 2014, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $50 million, primarily in the first half of 2014. The company expects significant restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2014 in connection with the acceleration of certain equity awards held by Life Technologies’ employees and severance obligations payable to former Life Technologies’ executives.

Note 15.       Discontinued Operations

In June 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, the company’s senior management made a decision to pursue a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The company completed the sale in October 2012 for nominal proceeds. The results of the laboratory workstations business have been classified and presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation.

In 2012, the company recorded an after-tax loss of $63 million on the divestiture. In addition, the company recorded an after-tax gain of $2 million upon receipt of additional proceeds from a prior divestiture.

Operating results of the laboratory workstations business were as follows:

740 million in cash and its Lancaster Laboratories business for $

180 million in cash and escrowed proceeds of $

20 million, substantially all of which was received in October 2012. The sale of these businesses resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $
