ratios. In addition to molecular information, each discrete chemical compound
generates a fragmentation pattern that provides structurally diagnostic
information. Chromatography is a technique for separating, identifying and
quantifying individual chemical components of substances based on physical and
chemical characteristics specific to each component. Optical spectroscopy is a
technique for analyzing individual chemical components of substances based on
the absorption or emission of electromagnetic radiation of a specific wavelength
of light, for example, visible (light), ultraviolet or infra-red.

In life sciences markets, we offer a
line of mass spectrometers including ion traps, quadrupoles and other advanced
mass spectrometers, as well as liquid chromatographs (LCs) and columns, and
multi-instrument combinations of these products as integrated solutions (LC-MS).

nervous system, respiratory and sexually transmitted diseases. The Healthcare
Market core product offering also includes high-end diagnostic instruments and
equipment together with the reagents used in those instruments and equipment to
perform diagnostic tests. Sales in the healthcare market are fueled by the
administration and evaluation of diagnostic tests. We believe that the aging
population, as well as the increased demand for the development of new specialty
diagnostic tests, will result in increased market growth.

In addition to our broad product
offering, we offer a variety of specialized services to our customers through
our Managed Services team. Services provided to customers include dedicated
logistics personnel that manage inventory, provide on-site customer service, and
deliver other services that allow our customers to focus on their core
responsibilities.

TM

, Fisher
Bioservices™, Lancaster Laboratories

TM

or
Priority Solutions™ brands.

On October 3, 2007, the company’s
Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired Priority Solutions
International, a leading U.S.-based third-party logistics provider to the
pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. The acquisition broadened the
segment’s clinical trials management services offerings.

Sales
and Marketing

We market and sell our products and
services through a direct sales force, customer-service professionals,
electronic commerce, third-party distributors and various catalogs.

We have approximately 7,500 sales and
service professionals including over 1,000 highly trained technical specialists
who enable us to better meet the needs of our more technical end-users. We also
provide customers with an efficient ordering system, product standardization and
other supply-chain-management services to reduce procurement costs.

New
Products and Research and Development

Our business includes the development
and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business
segments. We are not currently committed to any new products that require the
investment of a material amount of our funds, nor do we have any definitive
plans to enter new businesses that would require such an
investment.

Financial Statement Index



During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we spent
$239 million, $170 million and $153 million, respectively, on research and
development, excluding a charge in 2006 of $15 million for in-process research
and development at the date of the merger with Fisher.

Raw
Materials

Our management team believes that we
have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant
products from various sources. We do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining
the raw materials essential to our business. Raw-material and fuel prices are
subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies,
including the use of alternative materials and the use of derivative
instruments, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our
results.

Patents,
Licenses and Trademarks

Patents are important in both segments
of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so
important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a
whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and
developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or
otherwise falling within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from
work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the
company and may be limited by agreements or contracts.

We protect some of our technology as
trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks
used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with
others to grant and/or receive rights to patents and know-how.

Seasonal
Influences

Revenues in the fourth calendar quarter
are historically stronger than in the other quarters due to capital spending
patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers.

Working
Capital Requirements

There are no special inventory
requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material
adverse effect on our working capital.

Dependency
on a Single Customer

There is no single customer the loss of
which would have a material adverse effect on our business. No customer
accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in any of the past three
years.

Backlog

Our backlog of firm orders at year-end
2007 and 2006 was as follows:

We believe that virtually all of our
backlog at the end of 2007 will be filled during 2008. The increase in backlog
in 2007 is principally due to increased demand.

Financial Statement Index



Government
Contracts

Although the company transacts business
with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude
that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election
of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s
financial results.

Competition

General

The company encounters aggressive and
able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the
diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of
competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of
manufacturers and third-party distributors. In general, competitive climates in
the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer
demands that require continuing research and development. Our success in these
markets primarily depends on the following factors:

•

technical
      performance and advances in technology that result in new products and
      improved price/performance ratios;

•

product
      differentiation, availability and
reliability;

•

our
      broad product offering;

•

our
      reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and
      services;

•

customer
      service and support;

•

active
      research and application-development programs;
  and

•

relative
      prices of our products and
services.

Environmental
Matters

We are subject to various laws and
governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety
and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal
environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control
Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean
Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to
regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to
promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.

In addition to these federal
activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the
aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters
under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental
and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar
to federal requirements.

A number of our operations involve the
handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be
classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable
laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our
operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar
businesses.

Financial Statement Index



Our expenses for environmental
requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical
remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these
compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our
expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and
operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial
measures.

Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New
Jersey, facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984. Our Rockford,
Illinois, facility is subject to a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
corrective action program administered by the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency. We are required to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these
sites. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially
responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields
Superfund Site. This site was listed in 1983 on the National Priority List under
CERCLA. Both New Jersey sites are also the subjects of CERCLA National Resources
Damages claims.

We record accruals for environmental
liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and
regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates
based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental
specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental
matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation,
remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities
for environmental matters totaled $23 million at December 31, 2007 and were not
material prior to the merger with Fisher. The liability for environmental
matters associated with Fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair
value and as such was discounted to its net present value.

These environmental liabilities do not
include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our
accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to
incur. As a result, we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to
environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to
additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in
existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement
policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of
our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Regulatory
Affairs

Our operations, and some of the
products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and
regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution
of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and
security standards of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Food and Drug
Administration, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state
and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and
import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the
U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our
logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the
Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar
foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects
with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial
fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution
services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date,
none has had a material impact on our operations.

We are subject to laws and regulations
governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and
regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by
leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have
agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a
result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to
companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to
investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government
contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension
of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or
debarment.

Item 1A.

Risk
      Factors

Set forth below are the risks that we
believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking
statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and
limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 3.

We must develop new products, adapt
to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of
new products in order to remain competitive.

Our growth strategy includes
significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our
products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant
technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and
enhancements and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of
new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely
become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and
operating results would suffer.

Development of our products requires
significant investment; our products and technologies could become uncompetitive
or obsolete.

Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and
manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends
and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’
products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future
activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and
services that do not lead to significant revenue.

Many of our existing products and those
under development are technologically innovative and require significant
planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and
manufacturing-process levels. These activities require us to make significant
investments.

Financial Statement Index



Risk
Factors (continued)

Products in our markets undergo rapid
and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry
standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make
existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitors
may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’
requirements than we can. The products that we are currently developing, or
those we will develop in the future, may not be technologically feasible or
accepted by the marketplace, and our products or technologies could become
uncompetitive or obsolete.

It may be difficult for us to
implement our strategies for improving internal growth.

Some of the
markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several
years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve
our internal growth, including:

•

finding
      new markets for our products;

•

developing
      new applications for our
technologies;

•

combining
      sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more
      effectively;

•

allocating
      research and development funding to products with higher growth
      prospects;

•

continuing
      key customer initiatives;

•

expanding
      our service offerings;

•

strengthening
      our presence in selected geographic markets;
and

•

continuing
      the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and
      support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take
      advantage of our breadth in product
offerings.

We may not be able to successfully
implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the growth of
our business.

The company may be unable to integrate
successfully the legacy businesses of Thermo Electron Corporation and Fisher
Scientific International Inc. and may be unable to realize the anticipated
benefits of the merger.

The merger involved the combination of
two companies which previously operated as independent public companies. The
company is required to devote significant management attention and resources to
integrating its business practices and operations. Potential difficulties the
company may encounter in the integration process include the
following:

•

if
      we are unable to successfully combine the businesses of Thermo and Fisher
      in a manner that permits the company to achieve the cost savings and
      operating synergies anticipated to result from the merger, such
      anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or
      may take longer to realize than
expected;

•

lost
      sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either of the two
      former companies deciding not to do business with the
    company;

•

complexities
      associated with managing the combined
  businesses;

Financial Statement Index



Risk
Factors (continued)

•

integrating
      personnel from diverse corporate cultures while maintaining focus on
      providing consistent, high quality products and customer
      service;

•

potential
      unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated
      with the merger; and

•

inability
      to successfully execute a branding campaign for the combined
      company.

In addition, it is possible that the
integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption or
interruption of, or the loss of momentum in, the company’s ongoing businesses or
inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which
could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and
employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or
could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and
financial results of the company.

Our inability to protect our
intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In
addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property,
and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a
result.

We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade
secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes
because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products
through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in
part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent
protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We
own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional
applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not
be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to
us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently
broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us
may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these
patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors
may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual
property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries,
which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.
We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us
or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An
unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

We also rely on trade secrets and
proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by
confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants.
These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any
breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be
independently developed by our competitors.

Third parties may assert claims against
us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights.
For example, in September 2004 Applied Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments and
related parties brought a lawsuit against us alleging our mass spectrometer
systems infringe a patent held by the plaintiffs. We could incur substantial
costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In addition, parties making these claims could secure a
judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable
relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell,
distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad.
In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against
us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that
relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual
property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these
licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the
patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or
other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our
products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Financial Statement Index



Risk
Factors (continued)

Demand for most of our products
depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding
policies.

Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies,
laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public
and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy
spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a
significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. These
policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our
products.

Our results could be impacted if we
are unable to realize potential future benefits from new productivity
initiatives.

We continue to pursue practical process improvement (PPI)
programs and other cost saving initiatives at our locations which are designed
to further enhance our productivity, efficiency and customer satisfaction. While
we anticipate continued benefits from these initiatives, future benefits are
expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to
achieve.

Our business is impacted by general
economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we
operate. Adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our business in 2008
and beyond, resulting in:

•

reduced
      demand for some of our products;

•

increased
      rate of order cancellations or
delays;

•

increased
      risk of excess and obsolete
inventories;

•

increased
      pressure on the prices for our products and services;
  and

•

greater
      difficulty in collecting accounts
receivable.

Changes in governmental regulations
may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete
in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state,
local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety
and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to
meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in
regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For
example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for
use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could
have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.

If any of our security products fail
to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and
related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.

The
products sold by our environmental instruments business include a comprehensive
range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace
explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo
facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection
and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction,
it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the
product undetected, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also
many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such
as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training
of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be
significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of
our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot
be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims
or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.

Our inability to successfully
identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous
acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our
business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that
complement or augment our existing products and services. Promising
acquisitions

Financial Statement Index



Risk
Factors (continued)

are
difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including
competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including
antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete
transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial
premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. Further,
we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our
existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated
cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could
adversely affect our business.

Moreover, we have acquired many
companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded
significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance
sheet, which amount to approximately $8.71 billion and $1.33 billion,
respectively, as of December 31, 2007. We assess the realizability of the
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
These events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a
significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset.
Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash
flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If
we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the
impairment of those assets.

Our growth strategy to acquire new
businesses may not be successful and the integration of future acquisitions may
be difficult and disruptive to our ongoing operations.

We have retained contingent
liabilities from businesses that we have sold.

From 1997 through 2004, we
divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of $2
billion. As part of these transactions, we retained responsibility for some of
the contingent liabilities related to these businesses, such as lawsuits,
product liability and environmental claims and potential claims by buyers that
representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate. The
resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition; however, we can not be certain
that this favorable pattern will continue.

As a multinational corporation, we
are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely
affect our cash flows and results of operations.

International revenues
account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue
expanding our presence in international markets. In 2007, our international
revenues from continuing operations, including export revenues from the United
States, accounted for approximately 35% of our total revenues. The exposure to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International
revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could
adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S. dollars of
products and services provided by us in international markets, where payment for
our products and services is made in the local currency. As a multinational
corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in
currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the
“functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the
functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of
operations. In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by our
international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial
reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Should our
international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2007, currency
translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of
$241 million due to a weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies
in which the company sells products and services.

We are subject to laws and
regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws
and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by
leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.

We
have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and,
as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to
companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government
contracts differ from the laws governing

Financial Statement Index



Risk
Factors (continued)

private
contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that
are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation
for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to
comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts,
criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.

Because we compete directly with
certain of our largest customers and product suppliers, our results of
operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or
suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with
us.

Our largest customer

in the laboratory
consumables business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are
also significant competitors. Our business may be harmed in the short term if
our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in
a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture
products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party
suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our
business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large
third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.

Because we rely heavily on
third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these
services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship
products, increase our costs and lower our profitability

.

We ship a significant portion of our
products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such
as UPS and Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a
small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our
products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms,
overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If UPS or another
third-party package-delivery provider experiences a major work stoppage,
preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us
to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our
costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could
be adversely affected. In addition, if UPS or our other third-party
package-delivery providers increase prices, and we are not able to find
comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our
profitability could be adversely affected.

We are subject to regulation by various
federal, state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide
variety of regulations, including those regarding the manufacture of products,
the shipping of our products and environmental matters.

Some of our operations are subject to
regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international
agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from
design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and
distribution. If we fail to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s
regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall
products and cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our
costs and reduce our revenues.

We are subject to federal, state, local
and international laws and regulations that govern the handling, transportation,
manufacture, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic
or hazardous substances. Some risk of environmental damage is inherent in our
operations and the products we manufacture, sell or distribute. This requires us
to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable
environmental laws and regulations, including the establishment of reserves to
address potential environmental costs, and manage environmental
risks.

We rely heavily on manufacturing
operations to produce the products we sell, and our business could be adversely
affected by disruptions of our manufacturing operations.

Financial Statement Index



Risk
Factors (continued)

We rely upon our manufacturing
operations to produce many of the products we sell. Any significant disruption
of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power
interruptions, fire, earthquakes, or other events beyond our control could
adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely
affect our business. Although most of our raw materials are available from a
number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to
obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we are unable to obtain the
materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain
of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a
marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations.

We may be unable to adjust to rapid
changes in the healthcare industry, some of which could adversely affect our
business.

The healthcare industry has undergone
significant changes in an effort to reduce costs. These changes
include:

•

development
      of large and sophisticated groups purchasing medical and surgical
      supplies;

•

wider
      implementation of managed care;

•

legislative
      healthcare reform;

•

consolidation
      of pharmaceutical companies;

•

increased
      outsourcing of certain activities, including to low-cost offshore
      locations; and

•

consolidation
      of distributors of pharmaceutical, medical and surgical
      supplies.

We expect the healthcare industry to
continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes,
such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse
changes in legislation or regulations governing the delivery or pricing of
healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare-industry
participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the
prices they are willing to pay for our products or services.

We may incur unexpected costs from
increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and
cash flow.

Our primary commodity exposures are for
fuel, petroleum-based resins, steel and serum. While we may seek to minimize the
impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various
cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in
the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.

Unforeseen problems with the
implementation and maintenance of our information systems at certain of our
sites could interfere with our operations.

As a part of the effort to
upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing new enterprise
resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of
our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could
arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could adversely impact our
ability to do the following in a timely manner: provide quotes, take customer
orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and
track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our
business. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased
visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or
maximize our profit margins. As a result, our results of operations and cash
flows could be adversely affected.

Financial Statement Index



Risk
Factors (continued)

Our debt may adversely affect our cash
flow and may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our
activities.

As of December 31, 2007, we had
approximately $2.20 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the
ability to incur an additional $955 million of indebtedness under our revolving
credit facility. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of
credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing
our total leverage.

Our leverage could have negative
consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and
industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and
limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic
acquisitions.

Our ability to satisfy our obligations
depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial,
competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate
sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations. If we are unable to service our
debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic
acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. We
may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at
all.

Additionally, the agreements governing
our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain
affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other
limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make
investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with
affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility include a
debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any
lender has any commitment under the facility, or any loan or other obligation is
outstanding under the facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the
facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the
facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated
Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to
be greater than 3.0 to 1.0.

Our ability to comply with these
financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance,
which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including
factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest
rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may
result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could
permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay
that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under
one of our debt instruments

would trigger an event
of default under other of our debt instruments.

office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in
Massachusetts, California and Texas within the U.S., and in England, China,
Finland, Germany and Australia, under various leases that expire between 2008
and 2022.

Financial Statement Index



Laboratory
Products and Services

We own approximately 6.6 million square
feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in
Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and North Carolina within the U.S.,
and in England Germany, Canada, Denmark and France. We lease approximately 4.5
million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space,
principally in Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Maryland and Georgia within
the U.S. and in France, Germany and England, under various leases that expire
between 2008 and 2039.

Corporate
Headquarters

We own approximately 81,000 square feet
of office space in Massachusetts. We also own approximately 100,000 square feet
of office space in New Hampshire which was the former corporate headquarters of
Fisher.

We believe that all of the facilities
that we are currently utilizing are in good condition and are suitable and
adequate to meet our current needs. If we are unable to renew any of the leases
that are due to expire in 2008 or 2009, we believe that suitable replacement
properties are available on commercially reasonable terms.

Item 3.

Legal
      Proceedings

On September 3, 2004, Applera
Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments filed a
complaint against the company in U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware, Civil Action No. 04-1230-GMS. These plaintiffs allege that the
company’s mass spectrometer systems, including its triple quadrupole and certain
of its ion trap systems, infringe U.S. patent number 4,963,736 entitled “Mass
Spectrometer and Method and Improved Ion Transmission.” The plaintiffs seek
damages, including treble damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’
fees, prejudgment interest and injunctive relief. An unfavorable outcome could
have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.

On December 8, 2004 and February 23,
2005, the company asserted in two lawsuits in the same Delaware court, that one
or more of the plaintiffs in the above action infringe two patents of the
company (U.S. patent number 5,385,654 entitled “Controlled Temperature Anion
Separation by Capillary Electrophoresis” and U.S. patent number 6,528,784
entitled “Mass Spectrometer System Including a Double Ion Guide Interface and
Method of Operation”).

The lawsuits brought by the company seek relief
similar to that being sought by the plaintiffs.

Our business involves a risk of product
liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business. We are a party to
various lawsuits and legal proceedings, including consolidated multi-party
product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured.
These matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business, as
well as through acquisitions. We believe that some of the costs incurred in
defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury
and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by
certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or
purchasers. Management, after review and consideration with counsel, considers
that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters should not have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. While liabilities arising from potential future claims could become
material, we currently believe, on the basis of our claims history and related
factors, that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Actual
costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers, the degree
of coverage with respect to any particular claim, our success in litigating
these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally
liable. See “Item 1 — Business — Environmental Matters,” for
legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters.

We are subject to the jurisdiction of
various regulatory agencies including, among others, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and the Agency for International Development. Various
governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine
matters relating to our operations. Some operations involve and have involved
the handling,

Financial Statement Index



manufacture,
use or sale of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances
within the meaning of applicable environmental laws. Consequently, some risk of
environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products
as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses, and we cannot
assure that material damage will not occur or be discovered or that the damage
will not be determined to be material in the future.

Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations

Reference is made throughout this
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page
F-1 of this report.

Thermo Electron Corporation and
Fisher Scientific International Inc. completed a merger of the two companies on
November 9, 2006 in a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange. The Fisher businesses
are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research
community and clinical laboratories. The Fisher businesses provide a suite of
products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals, cell-culture
media and proprietary RNAi technology to rapid-diagnostic tests, safety products
and other consumable supplies. Fisher had revenues of $5.4 billion in 2005.
Fisher’s results are included in the accompanying financial statements from
November 9, 2006. Following the merger, the company was renamed Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc. To assist in year over year comparisons, certain information in
the following discussion of the company’s results of operations has been
presented on a pro forma basis, as if the two companies had been combined from
the beginning of 2006.

Overview
of Results of Operations and Liquidity

The company develops, manufactures and
sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the
product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own
core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary
businesses. Following the merger with Fisher, the company’s continuing
operations fall into two principal business segments: Analytical Technologies
and Laboratory Products and Services. Revenues in the fourth quarter are
historically stronger than in other q

uarters

due to capital
spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government
customers.

Sales
in 2007 were $9.75 billion, an increase of $5.95 billion from 2006. Sales
increased principally due to the merger with Fisher as well as other
acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased demand and the favorable effect
of currency translation. If the merger with Fisher had occurred on January 1,
2006, revenues would have increased $876 million (10%), over pro forma 2006
revenues. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and divestitures made by both
companies and currency translation (discussed in total and by segment below),
revenues increased over pro forma 2006 revenues by $507 million due to higher
revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand, discussed
below, and, to a lesser extent, price increases.

The company’s strategy is
to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary
acquisitions such as those completed in 2007 and 2006. In addition to the merger
with Fisher, the principal

acquisitions included La-Pha-Pack, a
manufacturer and provider of chromatography consumables and related accessories
in December 2007; Priority Solutions International, a third-party provider to
the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries in October 2007; NanoDrop
Technologies, Inc., a supplier of UV-Vis spectrophotometry and fluorescence
scientific instruments in October 2007; Qualigens Fine Chemicals, a chemical
manufacturer and supplier in September 2007 and Cohesive Technologies Inc., a
provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid chromatography products in
December 2006.

In 2007, the company’s operating income
and operating income margin were $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, compared
with $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, in 2006. (Operating income margin is
operating income divided by revenues.) The increase in operating income was due
to the Fisher merger and, to a lesser extent, higher profitability at existing
businesses resulting from incremental revenues, price increases and productivity
improvements and $125 million of pre-tax charges in 2006 associated with the
Fisher merger, described below. These increases were offset in part by $400
million of higher amortization expense as a result of acquisition-related
intangible assets from the Fisher merger and other acquisitions.

The company’s effective tax rate was
11.5% and 20.6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The tax provision in 2007 was
favorably affected by a one-time benefit of enacted reductions in tax rates in
the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and Germany on the company’s deferred tax
balances. This benefit totaled $32 million. In addition to the impact of this
item, the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007, compared with 2006, was
primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in
the United States due to charges and amortization associated with the Fisher
merger, together with the impact of an increased U.S. tax credit for foreign
taxes, an enhanced tax credit for qualifying U.S. research costs and growth in
lower tax regions such as Asia.

Income from continuing operations
increased to $780 million in 2007 from $166 million in 2006, primarily due to
the items discussed above that increased operating income in 2007 and the
one-time tax benefit discussed above, offset in part by higher interest expense,
primarily associated with debt assumed in the Fisher merger.

During 2007, the company’s cash flow
from operations totaled $1.48 billion, compared with $406 million for 2006. The
increase resulted from cash flow from the Fisher businesses and, to a lesser
extent, improved cash flow at existing businesses. Cash flow from operations in
2007 and 2006 were net of $78 million and $157 million, respectively, in
merger-related operating cash outflows, including severance and retirement
benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by Fisher that were paid
subsequent to November 9, 2006.

Financial Statement Index



As of December 31, 2007, the company’s
outstanding debt totaled $2.20 billion, of which 93% is due in 2010 and
thereafter. The company expects that its existing cash and short-term
investments of $639 million as of December 31, 2007, and the company’s future
cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowing capacity
of up to $955 million under its existing 5-year revolving credit agreement are
sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses
for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The company’s discussion and
analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis,
the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity
investments, bad debts, sales returns, inventories, business combinations,
intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs,
contingencies and litigation, stock-based compensation, restructuring and sale
of businesses. The company bases its estimates on historical experience, current
market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes
are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The company believes the following
represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation
of its financial statements:

(a)

Accounts
      Receivable

The
      company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
      resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such
      allowances totaled $49 million at December 31, 2007. The company estimates
      the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age
      of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other
      information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition
      of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to
      make payments, additional allowances would be
  required.

(b)

Inventories

The
      company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for
      differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking
      into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and
      any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage
      or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional
      writedowns may be required.

(c)

Intangible Assets and
      Goodwill

The
      company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of
      assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A
      significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s
      acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require that use of
      significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such
      intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the
      period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The
      company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets
      principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from
      identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash
      flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the
      dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $5.83 billion
      at December 31, 2007. The company reviews other intangible assets for
      impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a
      significant reduction in

Financial Statement Index



cash
      flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a
      particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which
      could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates
      of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such
      asset.

The
      company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for
      impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may
      reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of
      discounted future cash flows. Events or circumstances that might require
      an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions,
      economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive
      activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts.
      Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $8.71 billion and
      $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Estimates of future
      cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income
      growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other
      factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis
      could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation
      of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Should
      the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible
      assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines,
      or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the
      discount rate, charges for impairment may be
  necessary.

(d)

Other Long-Lived
      Assets

The
      company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of
      potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows
      associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $1.67 billion
      at December 31, 2007, including $1.27 billion of fixed assets. In testing
      a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning
      projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash
      flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth
      and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed
      for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from
      estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may
      be necessary.

(e)

Revenues

In
      instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation
      obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the
      equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the
      installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue
      between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value
      at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the
      installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected.
      If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for
      all elements is deferred until delivery is
  completed.

In
      instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified
      acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate
      adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance
      testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of
      customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in
      complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the
      company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of
      its products until completion of customer acceptance
    testing.

The
      company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products
      and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license
      revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been
      delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value
      exists for any undelivered elements. In the event

Financial Statement Index



VSOE
      is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is
      deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance
      and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
      term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and
      support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and
      support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting
      services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is
      determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are
      sold separately.

The
      company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by
      customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned,
      additional adjustments to revenue may be
  required.

(f)

Warranty
      Obligations

At
      the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated
      cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and
      knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected
      warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for
      warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $51
      million at December 31, 2007. Should product failure rates or the actual
      cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the
      estimated warranty liability would be
necessary.

(g)

Income
      Taxes

In
      the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in
      quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses
      income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to
      examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances
      and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions
      where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the
      company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than
      50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a
      taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For
      those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax
      benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the
      financial statements. Where applicable, associated interest expense has
      also been recognized.

The
      company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a
      result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S.
      tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these
      governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires
      the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of
      estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the
      amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue
      recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of
      income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and
      treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of
      operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an
      impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the
      company’s net income.

The
      company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards
      will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax
      jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss
      carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it
      becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be
      used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset
      generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from
      acquisitions. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $197 million
      at December 31, 2007. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by
      tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals
      thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future
      income tax payments in the worldwide tax
  jurisdictions

Financial Statement Index



in
      which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $64 million at December
      31, 2007. Should tax return positions that the company expects are
      sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to
      record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously
      unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the
      company’s tax provision or goodwill would
  result.

(h)

Contingencies and
      Litigation

The
      company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal
      proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and
      auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal
      course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment,
      historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where
      applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external
      legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of Fisher as of the merger
      date, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at their
      fair value and as such were discounted to their net present value.
      Additionally, we record receivables from third-party insurers when
      recovery has been determined to be
probable.

(i)

Pension and Other Retiree
      Benefits

Several
      of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit
      pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these
      arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the
      benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot
      be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major
      assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans
      include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of
      increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based
      on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with
      third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’
      measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and
      other postretirement benefit plans totaled $19 million in 2007 and the
      company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $170 million at year-end
      2007. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on
      net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For
      example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual
      increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of
      approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of
      approximately $97 million.

(j)

Stock-based
      Compensation

The
      fair value of each stock option granted by the company is
      estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of a valuation
      model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to
      selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility
      based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock.
      The expected lives of grants through 2007 were estimated using the
      simplified method for “plain vanilla” options as permitted by SAB 107.
      Thereafter, historical data on exercise patterns will become the basis for
      determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is
      based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which
      approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes
      in these input variables would affect the amount of expense
      associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation
      expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated
      forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based
      on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual
      forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to
      compensation expense may be
required.

Financial Statement Index



(k)

Restructuring
      Costs

The
      company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities
      based on future lease obligations and expected sub-rental income. The
      company’s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in
      continuing operations totaled $5 million at December 31, 2007. Should
      actual cash flows associated with sub-rental income from vacated
      facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be
      required.

(l)

Assets Held for
      Sale

The
      company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and,
      when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these
      assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated
      proceeds, which would include post-closing purchase price adjustments,
      vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected
      amounts.

Results
of Operations

Compared With 2006

Continuing
Operations

Sales in 2007 were $9.75 billion, an
increase of $5.95 billion from 2006. Sales increased principally due to the
merger with Fisher as well as other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent,
increased demand and the favorable effect of currency translation. If the merger
with Fisher had occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $876
million (10%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $128
million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures,
b) $241 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $507
million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased
demand and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong
in Asia and, to a lesser extent, North America and more moderate in
Europe.

In 2007, operating income and operating
income margin were $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, compared with $242
million and 6.4%, respectively, in 2006. The increase in operating income was
due to the inclusion of the Fisher businesses for a full year in 2007, $125
million of pre-tax charges associated with the Fisher merger incurred in 2006
and, to a lesser extent, higher profitability at existing businesses resulting
from incremental revenues, price increases and productivity improvements. These
increases were offset in part by $400 million of higher amortization expense as
a result of acquisition-related intangible assets from the Fisher merger and
other acquisitions.

Restructuring and other costs were
recorded during 2007 and 2006. Restructuring costs in 2007 primarily include
merger-related exit costs at existing businesses. The cost of actions at Fisher
businesses has been charged to the cost of the acquisition, while the cost of
actions at existing businesses being integrated with Fisher is charged to
restructuring expense. In 2007, the company recorded restructuring and other
costs, net, of $91 million, including $49 million of charges to cost of
revenues, substantially all related to the sale of inventories revalued at the
date of acquisition (principally Fisher). The company incurred $40 million of
cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation
expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. The company also recorded $2
million of loss on sale of a small business unit (Note 15). In 2006, the
company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $123 million, including
$78 million of charges to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of
inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher) and $30
million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and
relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the
company recorded a charge of $15 million for in-process research and development
at Fisher on the merger date. The company has substantially finalized its plan
for restructuring actions at Fisher or within existing businesses with which
Fisher is being integrated. Such actions have included rationalization of
product lines, consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing
levels.

Financial Statement Index



In October 2007, the company decided to
undertake closure of a Laboratory Products and Services segment manufacturing
facility in France. The operations of the factory will be consolidated with
those of existing factories in a phased plan through mid-2009. The company
recorded $11 million of charges associated with this action in 2007. The company
estimates additional future charges for retention, real estate abandonment,
moving costs and accelerated depreciation on assets to be abandoned as a result
of this action will total $7 to $9 million, including cash costs of $6 to $8
million, which will be recorded between the first quarter of 2008 and mid-2009,
when the facility ceases remaining operations. Also, the company has identified
other actions totaling $4 million that will be undertaken in 2008. The
restructuring actions initiated in 2007 resulted in annual cost savings
beginning in the second half of 2007 and early 2008 of approximately $11
million, principally in the Analytical Technologies segment.

The company’s management evaluates
segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges to
cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting;
restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility
consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and
losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; amortization of
acquisition-related intangible assets; and charges for the acceleration of
stock-based compensation following the merger with Fisher. The company uses this
measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core
operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining
compensation (Note 3).

Sales in the Analytical Technologies
segment increased $1.83 billion to $4.26 billion in 2007 primarily due to the
merger with Fisher and other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased
revenues at existing businesses and favorable currency translation. Had the
Fisher merger occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $514
million (14%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $99
million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures,
b) $136 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $279
million due to increased revenue at existing businesses as a result of increased
demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. The increase in demand was from
life science and industrial customers due in part to strong market response to
new products. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and
spectroscopy instruments as well as environmental monitoring equipment and, to a
lesser extent, process instruments and diagnostic tools.

Operating income margin was 19.8% in
2007 and 15.8% in 2006. The increase resulted from profit on incremental
revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements,
including cost-reduction measures following restructuring actions. Had the
merger with Fisher occurred on January 1, 2006, operating income margin would
have been 17.2% in 2006.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and

to the merger with Fisher and other acquisitions. Had the Fisher merger occurred
on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $405 million (7%) over pro
forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $30 million due to acquisitions
made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $106 million due to the
favorable effect of currency translation and c) $269 million due to increased
revenue at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser
extent, higher prices. Sales made through the segment’s research market channel,
which includes the Fisher catalog, and revenues from the company’s biopharma
outsourcing offerings were strong.

Operating income margin increased to
13.6% in 2007 from 13.5% in 2006, primarily due to the price increases and
productivity improvements, including restructuring actions, offset in part by
inclusion of Fisher revenues, which have a slightly lower operating margin than
the company’s legacy laboratory equipment business. Had the merger with Fisher
occurred on January 1, 2006, operating income margin would have been 12.2% in
2006.

Other
Expense, Net

The company reported other expense,
net, of $93 million and $33 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively (Note 4).
Other expense, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on
investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other
items, net. Interest income increased to $47 million in 2007 from $16 million in
the same period of 2006, primarily due to higher invested cash balances from
operating cash flow and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates.
Interest expense increased to $140 million in 2007 from $52 million in 2006,
primarily as a result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher. In August 2007,
the FASB issued proposed guidance on accounting for convertible debt instruments
that, if enacted, would increase the company’s reported interest expense in a
manner that reflects interest rates of similar non-convertible debt. The change
would not affect the company’s cash interest payments. There can be no assurance
at this time, however, as to the content of any final FASB rules on this
topic.

Provision
for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rate was
11.5% and 20.6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The tax provision in 2007 was
favorably affected by a one-time benefit of $32 million, discussed below. In
addition to the impact of this item, the decrease in the effective tax rate in
2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in
particular lower income in the United States due to charges and amortization
associated with the Fisher merger, together with the impact of an increased U.S.
tax credit for foreign taxes, an enhanced tax credit for qualifying U.S.
research costs, growth in lower tax regions such as Asia and, to a lesser
extent, a tax gain in excess of the related book gain on the sale of a product
line in 2006.

In 2007, the United Kingdom enacted new
tax legislation that will become effective on April 1, 2008, lowering its
corporate tax rate. Denmark, Canada and Germany also enacted new tax
legislation, with various effective dates, that will reduce the corporate tax
rate. As a result of these changes in tax rates, the deferred tax balances of
all the company’s entities in these countries have been adjusted to reflect the
new tax rates in 2007.

Contingent
Liabilities

At year-end 2007, the company was
contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related
matters. See “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 11. An unfavorable
outcome in one or more of the matters described therein could materially affect
the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash
flows.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. This statement applies to other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This statement
does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
the company’s monetary assets and liabilities in 2008 and for other assets and
liabilities in 2009. The company does not expect a material effect on its
monetary assets and liabilities from adopting SFAS No. 157 and is currently
evaluating the potential impact on its nonmonetary assets and liabilities of
adopting SFAS No. 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
- - including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 permits
entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and certain
other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument
basis. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable once made and
subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. The effect
of adoption will be reported as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning
retained earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the company beginning January
1, 2008. The company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this
standard.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 141R, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R, among other aspects, requires
the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the
acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired
and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose certain
information to enable users to understand the nature and financial effect of the
business combination. The statement requires that cash outflows such as
transaction costs and post-acquisition restructuring be charged to expense
instead of capitalized as a cost of the acquisition. Contingent purchase price
will be recorded at its initial fair value and then re-measured as time passes
through adjustments to net income. SFAS No. 141R is effective for the company in
2009. The company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption.

Financial Statement Index



In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” SFAS
No. 160 will change the accounting for minority interests, which will be
reclassified as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of
equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the company in 2009. The company does not
expect a material effect from adoption of this standard.

Discontinued
Operations

Subsequent to the 2006 acquisition of
GV Instruments Limited (GVI), the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) commenced an
investigation of the transaction to determine whether it qualified for
consideration under the UK Enterprise Act. On December 15, 2006, the OFT
referred the transaction to the UK Competition Commission for further
investigation under the Enterprise Act to determine whether the transaction had
resulted in, or may be expected to result in, a substantial lessening of
competition within any market in the UK for goods or services, particularly gas
isotope ratio mass spectrometers (Gas IRMS), thermal ionization mass
spectrometers (TIMS) and multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometers. The Competition Commission published its final report on May 30,
2007, concluding that the company’s acquisition of GVI would lead to a
substantial lessening of competition in the UK in the markets for Gas IRMS and
TIMS products. The Competition Commission has further concluded that a
divestiture remedy was appropriate and has therefore required the company to
divest of either GVI as a whole, or its Gas IRMS and TIMS assets (which together
comprise the majority of the business), to purchasers approved by the
Competition Commission. As a result of this divestiture requirement the company
recorded after-tax impairment charges in 2007 totaling $29 million. The loss
primarily represents non-cash charges to reduce the carrying value of the
business to estimated disposal value. Due to the immateriality of the operating
results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not
reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to
discontinued operations. In February 2008, the company completed the sale of
GVI’s two principal product lines that required divestiture.

Aside from the impairment loss related
to the divestiture of GVI, the company had after-tax gains of $10 million in
2007 from discontinued operations, primarily from the receipt of additional
proceeds from the sale of a business in 2000 and a revision to the company’s
estimate of loss from litigation related to a divested business.

The company had after-tax gains of $2
million in 2006 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The gains
represent additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004,
net of a charge for the settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a
divested business.

Compared With 2005

Continuing
Operations

Sales in 2006 were $3.79 billion, an
increase of $1.16 billion (44%) from 2005. Sales increased $978 million due to
acquisitions (principally Fisher), net of divestitures. The favorable effects of
currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $18 million in 2006.
Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and currency
translation, revenues increased $163 million (6%) primarily due to increased
demand and, to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below.
Growth was strong in Asia and Europe and moderate in North America.

In 2006, operating income and operating
income margin were $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, compared with $263
million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2005. The decrease in operating income and
operating income margin was due to $125 million of pre-tax charges associated
with the Fisher merger and $93 million of higher amortization expense,
principally due to the Fisher merger. The $125 million of charges includes $73
million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at
the date of the merger, $37 million of accelerated stock-based compensation due
to a change in control occurring at the merger date and $15 million of
in-process research and development at Fisher on the date of the merger. The
unfavorable effect of these items was offset in part by the inclusion of
Fisher’s results from November 9, 2006, through the end of the year and higher
profitability at existing businesses due to increased revenue, productivity
improvements, including lower costs following restructuring actions and, to a
lesser extent, price increases.

Financial Statement Index



In 2006, the company recorded
restructuring and other costs, net, of $123 million, including $78 million of
charges to cost of revenues consisting of $75 million for the sale of
inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher) and $3
million for accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to
facility consolidations. The company incurred $30 million of cash costs,
primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at
businesses that have been consolidated. As discussed above, the company recorded
a charge of $15 million for in-process research and development at Fisher on the
merger date. In 2005, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net,
of $30 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $13 million, primarily
for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company
incurred $23 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned
facilities and relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro
with existing businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8
million, primarily from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $2
million, principally for the writedown of a building held for sale.

to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was
particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments
and, to a lesser extent, anatomical pathology products and equipment sold in
commodity markets such as steel, petroleum and cement.

Operating income margin was 15.8% in
2006 and 14.2% in 2005. The increase resulted from profit on incremental
revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements,
including cost-reduction measures following restructuring actions. Had stock
option compensation been recorded as expense in 2005, the operating income
margin in 2005 would have been 13.4%.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and
Services segment increased $780 million to $1.41 billion in 2006. Sales
increased $769 million due to the Fisher merger and other acquisitions, net of
divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an
increase in revenues of $8 million in 2006. In addition to the changes in
revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation,
revenues increased $3 million due to an increase in demand for laboratory
equipment.

Operating income margin decreased to
13.5% in 2006 from 13.8% in 2005, primarily due to the inclusion of stock option
compensation in 2006 following adoption of SFAS No. 123R, offset in part by
price increases and productivity improvements, including restructuring actions.
Had stock option compensation been recorded as expense in 2005, the operating
income margin in 2005 would have been 13.1%.

Other
Income (Expense), Net

The company reported other expense,
net, of $33 million in 2006 and other income, net, of $22 million in 2005 (Note
4). Interest income increased to $16 million in 2006 from $12 million in 2005,
primarily due to higher invested cash balances from operating cash flow and, to
a lesser extent, increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to
fund acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $52 million in 2006 from $27
million in 2005, as a result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher and, to a
lesser extent, a full year of debt used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition
and higher rates associated with the company’s variable-rate debt.

During 2006 and 2005, the company had
gains on investments, net, of $1 million and $35 million, respectively. The
gains included $29 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Thoratec
Corporation and a loss of $1 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Newport
Corporation, in addition to other gains from the company’s investment portfolio
activity. The company obtained common shares of Thoratec as part of the sale of
Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001 and obtained the shares of Newport as part of
the sale of Spectra-Physics in 2004. Following the sale of shares in 2005, the
company no longer owns shares of Thoratec or Newport. Other income in 2006 and
2005 also includes net currency transaction gains and equity in earnings of
unconsolidated subsidiaries.

Provision
for Income Taxes

The company’s effective tax rate was
20.6% and 30.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the effective
tax rate in 2006, compared with 2005, was primarily due to geographic changes in
profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges
associated with the Fisher merger, partially offset by non-deductible merger
related costs. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4 million for
the estimated effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non-U.S. country. The
effect of this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage
points.

Financial Statement Index



Discontinued
Operations

The company’s discontinued operations
reported after-tax income of $0.5 million in 2006, representing the results of
two small Fisher businesses held for sale.

The company had after-tax gains of $2
million in 2006 and $25 million in 2005 from the disposal of discontinued
operations. The 2006 gains represent additional proceeds from the sale of
several businesses prior to 2004, net of a charge for the settlement of an
indemnification claim that arose from a divested business.

An after-tax gain of $17 million arose
from the September 2005 sale of the company’s point of care and rapid
diagnostics business for $53 million in cash. Revenues and pre-tax loss of the
divested business totaled $30 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2004 and
revenues and pre-tax income totaled $27 million and $1 million, respectively, in
2005 through the date of sale. Due to the immateriality of the operating results
of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not
reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to
discontinued operations. In addition to the sale of this business, the company
had after-tax gains aggregating $8 million in 2005 representing additional
proceeds from the sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale
of abandoned real estate and post-closing adjustments, and the settlement of
litigation and an arbitration award related to divested businesses.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Consolidated working capital was
$1.76 billion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.51 billion at December 31,
2006. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in short-term borrowings.
Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term
available-for-sale investments of $639 million at December 31, 2007, compared
with $691 million at December 31, 2006.


Cash provided by operating activities
was $1.48 billion during 2007. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds,
totaled $125 million in 2007. The company did not make significant U.S.
estimated tax payments in 2007, primarily due to tax deductions for
merger-related stock-based compensation and net operating loss carryforwards.
The company expects to make tax payments of approximately $325 to $375 million
in 2008. The company made $78 million of merger related payments in 2007, which
reduced operating cash. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s
continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of
real estate consolidation, used cash of $40 million during 2007.

In connection with restructuring
actions undertaken by continuing operations, the company had accrued $19 million
for restructuring costs at December 31, 2007. The company expects to pay
approximately $14 million of this amount for severance, retention and other
costs, primarily through 2009. The balance of $5 million will be paid for lease
obligations over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 23% to be
paid through 2008 and the remainder through 2013. In addition, at December 31,
2007, the company had accrued $10 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued
acquisition expenses included $4 million of severance and relocation
obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily during 2008. The
remaining balance primarily represents abandoned-facility payments that will be
paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2010.

During 2007, the primary investing
activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale
investment activities, were acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and
equipment. The company expended $497 million on acquisitions and $176 million
for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company collected a note
receivable from Newport Corporation totaling $48 million and had proceeds from
the sale of property, plant and equipment of $19 million, principally real
estate. The company’s discontinued operations provided cash of $31 million from
investing activities, principally the sale of Genevac Limited.

Financial Statement Index



The company’s financing activities used
$929 million of cash during 2007, principally for the repayment of $464 million
of short-term debt and the repurchase of $898 million of the company’s common
stock, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had
proceeds of $345 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $97
million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. In February 2007,
the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the
company’s common stock through February 28, 2008. On August 9, 2007, the Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $700 million of the
company’s common stock through August 8, 2008. At December 31, 2007, $102
million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under
the August 8, 2008 Board authorization.

The company has no material commitments
for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2008,
such expenditures will approximate $230 to $250 million.

The company believes that its existing
resources, including cash and investments, future cash flow from operations and
available borrowings under its existing revolving credit facilities, are
sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses
for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.


Cash provided by operating activities
was $406 million during 2006, including $407 million provided by continuing
operations. A reduction in current liabilities used cash of $80 million,
primarily as a result of merger-related payments made following completion of
the transaction totaling $157 million, including executive severance and
retirement benefits, and transaction costs incurred by Fisher, offset in part by
an increase in other accrued expenses. Cash of $32 million was provided by
collections on accounts receivable. Payments for restructuring actions of the
company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other
expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $30 million during
2006.

During 2006, the primary investing
activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale
investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant
and equipment and the sale of product lines. Cash acquired in the merger with
Fisher totaled $360 million, net of transaction costs. The company expended $132
million on acquisitions and $77 million for purchases of property, plant and
equipment. The company partially liquidated assets totaling $40 million in a
Fisher retirement trust to fund payments that were due to former Fisher
executives following the merger. The company had proceeds from the sale of
product lines of $9 million. Investing activities of the company’s discontinued
operations provided $5 million of cash during 2006, primarily additional
proceeds from a business divested prior to 2004.

The company’s financing activities used
$260 million of cash during 2006, principally for the repurchase of $300 million
of the company’s common stock and the repayment of $335 million of debt, offset
in part by short-term borrowing and proceeds of stock option exercises. The
company increased short-term borrowings by $177 million in 2006. The company had
proceeds of $180 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $17
million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options.


Cash provided by operating activities
was $271 million during 2005, including $273 million provided by continuing
operations and $2 million used by discontinued operations. Cash of $42 million
was provided by an increase in other current liabilities, primarily accrued
payroll and benefits due to the timing of payments, and deferred revenue,
pending completion of obligations to customers. Income tax payments of
approximately $13 million arose from taxes on gains on the sale of investments.
The company contributed $11 million of funding to a U.K. pension plan in June
2005. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations,
principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate
consolidation, used cash of $20 million in 2005.

Financial Statement Index



During 2005, the primary investing
activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale
investment activities, included acquisitions and the purchase and sale of
property, plant and equipment. The company expended $933 million, net of cash
acquired, for the acquisitions of Niton, R&P, Kendro and Ionalytics
(Note 2). The company expended $44 million for the purchases of property,
plant and equipment and had proceeds from the sale of property, principally
abandoned real estate, of $16 million. Investing activities of the company’s
discontinued operations provided $66 million of cash in 2005, primarily from the
sale of its point of care and rapid diagnostics business in September 2005 and
the sale of a building of a previously divested business in August
2005.

The company’s financing activities
provided $391 million of cash during 2005, principally from the issuance of $250
million senior notes due in 2015 and a net increase in short-term borrowings of
$119 million. The company received net proceeds of $27 million from the exercise
of employee stock options during 2005.

The company repaid in full $570 million
of borrowings under its bridge loan with cash and proceeds of new debt issuances
described below. In May 2005, the company issued $250 million aggregate
principal amount of 5% senior notes (the Notes) due 2015, with an effective
interest rate of 5.27% after including the impact of an interest rate swap
arrangement. Under the Notes’ Indenture, the company is subject to certain
affirmative and negative covenants.

Also in May 2005, the company entered
into an arrangement that provides the company an uncommitted line of credit of
up to $250 million through a series of short-term money market loans funded on
an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such money market loans have maturity
periods of overnight to 364 days and bear varying rates of interest based on the
maturity date and market rate at the time of issuance. In May 2005, the company
borrowed $250 million through three short-term loans under the money market
arrangement with maturities of one week to three months. As of December 31,
2005, the company had repaid the borrowings under this arrangement.

In June 2005, the company entered
into a five-year revolving credit facility with a bank group that provided up to
175 million euros. The facility carried interest at a Euribor rate plus 35 basis
points. As of December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding borrowings under
this facility of 105 million euros ($124 million) in two tranches with
maturities in January 2006 and with a weighted average interest rate of 2.47%.
The facility was terminated in 2006.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

The company did not use special purpose
entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2005 - 2007 except
for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees
disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for
letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $12
million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally
in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees
of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of
business.

Obligation
      represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the

Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits
of $79 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to
predict the timing of tax audit resolutions.

The company has no material commitments
for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2008, such
expenditures for its existing business will approximate $230 to $250
million.

In disposing of assets or businesses,
the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to
cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets,
environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to
investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the
disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential
liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions.
However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would
have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of

Item 7A

.

Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

The company is exposed to market risk
from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity prices, which
could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The
company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and
financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward
contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into
forward currency-exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments
denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries’ local currencies. The
company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the
purpose of the company’s currency hedging activities is to protect the company’s
local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in
currency exchange rates. The company’s forward currency-exchange contracts
principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British
pounds sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. Income and losses
arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income
resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter
into speculative currency agreements.

Interest
Rates

Certain of the company’s short-term
available-for-sale investments and long-term obligations are sensitive to
changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the
fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the
market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the
financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year-end 2007 and 2006 market interest
rates would result in a net negative impact to the company of $181 million and
$84 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its interest-sensitive
financial instruments.

In addition, interest rate changes
would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate
debt instruments. A 100-basis-point increase in 90-day LIBOR at December 31,
2007 and 2006, would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by
$4.7 million and $9 million, respectively.

Currency
Exchange Rates

The company views its investment in
international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s
reporting currency as permanent. The company’s investment in international
subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The
functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are
principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. The
effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in
international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive
items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2007
and 2006 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a
reduction of shareholders’ equity of $297 million and $324 million,
respectively.

The fair value of forward
currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.
The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount
that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking
into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in
year-end 2007 and 2006 currency exchange rates related to the company’s
contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward
currency-exchange contracts of $22 million and $7 million, respectively. The
unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from
changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses
or gains on the exposures being hedged.

Certain of the company’s cash and cash
equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of
the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10%
depreciation in the related year-end 2007 and 2006 currency exchange rates
applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $26 million
and $5 million, respectively, on the company’s net income.

Financial Statement Index



Equity
Prices

The company’s available-for-sale
investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to
fluctuations in price. In addition, the company’s convertible obligations are
sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock. Changes in
equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s
available-for-sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference
between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or
issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year-end 2007 and 2006
market equity prices would reduce the fair value of the company’s convertible
obligations by $184 million and $128 million, respectively.

Management’s
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The company’s management, with the
participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of
December 31, 2007. Based on this evaluation, the company’s chief executive
officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, the
company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, reported and accumulated and communicated to the
company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management, including the
company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the
company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 based on criteria established
in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
assessment, the company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2007,
the company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective.

The company’s independent registered
public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, as stated in their report that appears on page F-2 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the
company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31,
2007, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting.

THERMO
FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To

the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.:

In our
opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,

in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements, the financial statement schedule and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions.

As
discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in 2006 and
the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans effective December 31, 2006.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Nature
      of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Nature
of Operations

A world leader in serving science,
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company, formerly Thermo Electron
Corporation) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.
The company offers customers a complete range of high-end analytical
instruments, software, services, consumables and reagents to enable integrated
laboratory workflow solutions and a complete portfolio of laboratory equipment,
chemicals, supplies and services used in healthcare, scientific research, safety
and education. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech companies,
hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, universities, research institutions and
government agencies, as well as environmental and industrial process control
settings.

Principles
of Consolidation

On November 9, 2006, the company
completed a merger with Fisher Scientific International Inc. (Fisher). Fisher’s
accounts and results are included in the accompanying financial statements from
that date (Note 2). The accompanying financial statements include the accounts
of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company
accounts for investments in businesses in which it owns between 20% and 50%
using the equity method.

Revenue
Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Revenue is recognized after all
significant obligations have been met, collectibility is probable and title has
passed, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery or completion of
services. If customer-specific acceptance criteria exist, the company recognizes
revenue after demonstrating adherence to the acceptance criteria. The company
recognizes revenue and related costs for arrangements with multiple
deliverables, such as equipment and installation, as each element is delivered
or completed based upon its relative fair value. If fair value is not available
for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery
is completed. When a portion of the customer’s payment is not due until
installation or acceptance, the company defers that portion of the revenue until
completion of installation or acceptance has been obtained. Revenues for
training are deferred until the service is completed. Revenues for extended
service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period. Provisions
for discounts, warranties, rebates to customers, returns and other adjustments
are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded.

The company recognizes revenue from the
sale of software. License fee revenues relate primarily to sales of perpetual
licenses to end-users and are recognized when a formal agreement exists, the
license fee is fixed and determinable, delivery of the software has occurred and
collection is probable. Software arrangements with customers often include
multiple elements, including software products, maintenance and support. The
company recognizes software license fees based on the residual method after all
elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE)
of fair value exists for such undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not
available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred
until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support
contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract,
which is generally a period of one year. VSOE of fair value of software
maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the
maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and
consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE,
which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services
are sold separately.

Nature
      of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
      (continued)

Accounts receivable are recorded at
the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances
for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing
accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on historical
write-off experience. Past due balances are reviewed individually for
collectibility. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the
company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The
company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to
customers.

The company records shipping and
handling charges billed to customers in net sales and records shipping and
handling costs in cost of goods sold for all periods presented.

Deferred revenue in the accompanying
balance sheet consists primarily of unearned revenue on service contracts, which
is recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts. Substantially all of the
deferred revenue in the accompanying 2007 balance sheet will be recognized
within one year.

Warranty
Obligations

The company provides for the estimated
cost of product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of
revenues at the time product revenue is recognized. While the company engages in
extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring
and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the company’s warranty
obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material
usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and
supplier warranties on parts delivered to the company. Should actual product
failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs or
supplier warranties on parts differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to
the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties
is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The
changes in the carrying amount of warranty obligations are as

Nature

      (continued)

Income
Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” the company recognizes deferred income taxes
based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the
financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities,
calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return.

In July 2006, the FASB released FIN 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109.” FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should
recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain
tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return.
Under FIN 48, the financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences
of such positions presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the
position and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of
money. FIN 48 also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a
prescriptive, annual, tabular roll-forward of the unrecognized tax benefits.
Refer to Note 6 for more information regarding the company’s adoption of FIN
48.

Earnings
per Share

Basic earnings per share has been
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to
income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share has been computed
in 2005 and 2006 assuming the conversion of the company’s 3.25% Subordinated
Convertible Debentures and the elimination of the related interest expense, and
for all periods using the treasury stock method for the remaining convertible
obligations, warrants and the exercise of stock options, as well as their
related income tax effects (Note 7). Substantially all of the company’s 3.25%
Subordinated Convertible Debentures were converted to common stock in December
2006 and the remainder was redeemed in early January 2007.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consists
principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable
securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These
investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

Investments

The company’s marketable equity and
debt securities that are part of its cash management activities are considered
short-term investments in the accompanying balance sheet. Such securities
principally represent available-for-sale investments. In addition, the company
owns marketable equity securities that represent less than 20% ownership and for
which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence. Such
investments are also considered available-for-sale. All available-for-sale
securities are carried at market value, with the difference between cost and
market value, net of related tax effects, recorded in the “Accumulated other
comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity (Notes 8 and 9).
Decreases in market values of individual securities below cost for a duration of
six to nine months are deemed indicative of other than temporary impairment, and
the company assesses the need to write down the carrying amount of the
investments to market value through other income (expense), net, in the
accompanying statement of income (Note 4).

The company has securities held in a
rabbi trust for a legacy Fisher supplemental non-qualified executive retirement
program, as more fully described in Note 5 – Employee Benefit Plans. These
securities had a fair market value of approximately $7 million and $33 million
at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The assets held in the rabbi trust
are comprised of 1% cash and cash equivalents, 51% debt securities and 48%
equity securities at December 31, 2007.

Nature

      (continued)

Other investments for which there is
not a readily determinable market value are accounted for under the cost method
of accounting. The company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its
investment accounted for under the cost method of accounting, which provides
that they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the company had cost method investments with
carrying amounts of $8.0 million and $9.6 million, respectively, which are
included in other assets.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower
of cost or market, cost being determined principally by the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method with certain of the company’s subsidiaries utilizing the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of
inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each
product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is
subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company assesses the carrying value
of this inventory based on a lower of cost or market analysis. The company
records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying
value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the
procurement and warehousing of inventories, such as inbound freight charges,
purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in
cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income. The components of
inventories are as follows:

The value of inventory maintained using
the LIFO method was $175.6 million and $177.3 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively, which approximated estimated replacement cost.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are
recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company provides
for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements,
25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment, 3 to 10 years; and leasehold
improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset.
When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and only the resulting
gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property,
plant and equipment consists of the following:

Acquisition-related
Intangible Assets

Acquisition-related intangible assets
include the costs of acquired product technology, patents, tradenames and other
specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 20
years. In addition, the company has tradenames that it acquired in the merger
with Fisher that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. The company
reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential
impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with
the assets. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment
annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be
impaired. Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows:

Other assets in the accompanying
balance sheet include deferred tax assets, insurance recovery receivables
related to product liability matters, notes receivable, cash surrender value of
life insurance, deferred debt expense, capitalized catalog costs, cost-method
investments, investments in joint ventures and other assets.

In May and July 2007, the company
contributed businesses with annualized third-party revenues and net assets of
$43 million and $101 million, respectively, to newly formed joint ventures with
third parties. The joint ventures were formed to combine the company’s
capabilities with those of businesses contributed by the respective joint
venture partners in the fields of integrated response technology services and
disposable laboratory glass products. The company owns 49% - 50% of the joint

Goodwill

The company assesses the realizability
of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it
may be impaired. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence
of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or
more of the company’s reporting units. The company estimates the fair value of
its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. When an
impairment is indicated, any excess of carrying value over fair value of
goodwill is recorded as an operating loss.

The company completed annual tests
for impairment at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and determined that goodwill was
not impaired. The company used an income approach to determine the fair value of
its reporting units.

The changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill by segment are as follows:

Asset
Retirement Obligations

The company records obligations
associated with its lease obligations, the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and the associated asset-retirement costs in accordance with SFAS No.
143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and FIN 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an Interpretation of SFAS No. 143.” The
company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived
assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition,
construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined
that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation is
conditional on a future event, the fair value of the liability for an asset
retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability
is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and

this
additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The
difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is
accreted over the life of the related lease as interest expense. At December 31,
2007 and 2006, the company had recorded asset retirement obligations of $31.3
million and $22.9 million, respectively.

Accounts
Payable

The company, in accordance with FIN
39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts,” reclassifies net book
overdrafts to accounts payable at period end. Amounts reclassified to accounts
payable totaled $83.9 million and $97.2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Bank overdrafts of $3.9 million at December 31, 2006, were
reclassified to short-term debt.

Loss
Contingencies

Accruals are recorded for various
contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’
compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other
claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on
management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses
and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external
legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records
receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery
has been determined to be probable. Liabilities acquired in the merger with
Fisher have been recorded at their fair value and, as such, were discounted to
their present value at the date of acquisition.

Advertising

The company expenses advertising
costs as incurred, except for certain direct-response advertising, which is
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected period of
future benefit, generally two years. The company has capitalized advertising
costs of $11.2 million and $14.4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet.
Direct-response advertising consists of external catalog production and mailing
costs, and amortization begins on the date the catalogs are first mailed.
Advertising expense, which following the merger with Fisher includes
amortization of capitalized direct-response advertising, as described above, was
$76.0 million, $57.8 million and $36.0 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Included in advertising expense was catalog amortization of $12.7
million and $2.0 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Currency
Translation

All assets and liabilities of the
company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, and
revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year in
accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation.” Resulting
translation adjustments are reflected in the “Accumulated other comprehensive
items” component of shareholders’ equity. Currency transaction gains and losses
are included in the accompanying statement of income and are not material for
the three years presented.

Forward
Contracts

The company accounts for forward
currency contracts under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that all
derivatives, including forward currency-exchange contracts, be recognized in the
balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are recorded at
fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge,

depending
on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are
either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through
earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. The company immediately records in earnings the extent
to which a hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value
or cash flows.

The company uses forward
currency-exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain operational (cash-flow
hedges) and balance sheet (fair-value hedges) exposures resulting from changes
in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and
intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional
currencies of the respective operations. These contracts principally hedge
transactions denominated in Euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling,
Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. The company enters into these
currency-exchange contracts to hedge anticipated product purchases and sales and
assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business, principally
accounts receivable and intercompany loans. Accordingly, the hedges are not
speculative in nature. As part of the company’s overall strategy to manage the
level of exposure to the risk of currency-exchange fluctuations, some operating
units hedge a portion of their currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing
12-month period, using exchange contracts that have maturities of 12 months or
less. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative
instruments for purposes other than risk management.

The company records its forward
currency-exchange contracts at fair value in its balance sheet as other current
assets or other accrued expenses and, for cash-flow hedges, the related gains or
losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive items in the accompanying balance sheet. These deferred gains and
losses are recognized in earnings in the period in which the underlying
anticipated transaction occurs. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from the
impact of currency exchange rate movements on fair-value hedges are recognized
in earnings in the period in which the exchange rates change and offset the
currency losses and gains on the underlying exposure being hedged. Cash flows
resulting from currency-exchange contracts qualifying as cash-flow hedges are
recorded in the accompanying statement of cash flows in the same category as the
item being hedged. At December 31, 2007, the company did not have any deferred
gains or losses relating to forward currency-exchange contracts. The ineffective
portion of the gain or loss on derivative instruments is recorded in other
income (expense), net, in the accompanying statement of income and is not
material for the three years presented.

The company entered into an interest
rate swap agreement in 2005 in connection with debt issued for the Kendro
acquisition (Note 10).

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. This statement applies to other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This statement
does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
the company’s monetary assets and liabilities in 2008 and for other assets and
liabilities in 2009. The company does not expect a material effect on its
monetary assets and liabilities from adopting SFAS No. 157 and is currently
evaluating the potential impact on its nonmonetary assets and liabilities of
adopting SFAS No. 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
- - including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 permits
entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and certain
other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument
basis. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable once made and
subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. The effect
of adoption will be reported as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning
retained earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the company beginning January
1, 2008. The company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this
standard.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 141R, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R does the following: requires
the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the
acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired
and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose certain
information to enable users to understand the nature and financial effect of the
business combination. The statement requires that cash outflows such as
transaction costs and post-acquisition restructuring be charged to expense
instead of capitalized as a cost of the acquisition. Contingent purchase price
will be recorded at its initial fair value and then re-measured as time passes
through adjustments to net income. SFAS No. 141R is effective for the company in
2009. The company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” SFAS
No. 160 will change the accounting for minority interests, which will be
reclassified as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of
equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the company in 2009. The company does not
expect a material effect from adoption of this standard.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefits Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R.”
SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined
benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability.
This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets
and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component
of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial (gains) losses and
prior service costs (credits) that arise but were not previously required to be
recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive
income will be adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as
components of net periodic benefit cost. SFAS No. 158 was effective for the
company as of December 31, 2006. The incremental effect of applying SFAS No. 158
on individual line items in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006
was as follows:

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates were made in estimating
future cash flows to quantify impairment of assets, and in determining the
ultimate loss from abandoning leases at facilities being exited (Note 15).
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Acquisitions

In September 2007, the company’s
Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired Qualigens Fine Chemicals, a
division of GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd. based in Mumbai, India.
Qualigens is India’s largest chemical manufacturer and supplier, serving
customers in a variety of industries including pharmaceutical, petrochemical and
food and beverage. The purchase price totaled $59 million. The acquisition
provided an established business in a fast-growing region to extend the
company’s reach. Revenues of Qualigens totaled $24 million in 2006. The purchase
price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $25
million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In October 2007, the company’s
Laboratory Products and Services segment acquired Priority Solutions
International, a U.S.-based leading third-party logistics provider to the
pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. The purchase price totaled $165
million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition broadened the segment’s clinical

2006 Merger with Fisher Scientific
International Inc.

Thermo Electron Corporation and
Fisher Scientific International Inc. announced on May 8, 2006 that the boards of
directors of both companies had unanimously approved a definitive agreement to
combine the two companies in a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange. The Fisher
businesses are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific
research community and clinical laboratories. The Fisher businesses provide a
suite of products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals,
cell-culture media and proprietary RNAi technology to rapid-diagnostic tests,
safety products and other consumable supplies. Fisher had revenues of $5.4
billion in 2005. The transaction was approved by both companies’ shareholders,
in separate meetings, held on August 30, 2006 and, following regulatory
approvals, was completed on November 9, 2006. The results of the operations of
Fisher have been included in the results of the company from the date of
acquisition. Following the merger, the company was renamed Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.

Under the terms of the agreement,
Fisher shareholders received two shares of company common stock for each share
of Fisher common stock they owned. Based on the average closing price for the
two trading days before and after the announcement date of $38.93 per share,
this exchange represented a value of $77.86 per Fisher share, or an aggregate
equity value of $10.28 billion. The company also assumed Fisher’s debt ($2.28
billion). The merger enabled the two companies to broaden their customer
offerings to include a full range of analytical instruments, equipment, reagents
and consumables, software and services for research, analysis, discovery and
diagnostics.

Upon completion of the transaction,
Thermo’s shareholders owned approximately 39 percent of the combined company,
and Fisher’s shareholders owned approximately 61 percent. Based upon pre-merger
members of the company’s board of directors and senior management representing a
majority of the composition of the combined company’s board and senior
management and the Fisher shareholders receiving a premium (as of the date
preceding the merger announcement) over the fair market value of Fisher common
stock on such date, the company is considered to be the acquirer for accounting
purposes.

The purchase price exceeded the fair
value of the acquired net assets, and accordingly, $6.50 billion was allocated
to goodwill, approximately $450 million of which is deductible for tax
purposes.

The company allocated $15 million of
the purchase price for Fisher to in-process research and development, which
represents the estimated fair value at November 9, 2006 related to in-process
projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future uses as of the date of the merger. The company recorded as
expense the value attributable to these projects at the date of the
merger.

The company uses the income approach to
determine the fair values of its purchased research and development. This
approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows
attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting
these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. In determining the value of
the in-process projects, the company considers, among other factors, the
in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed
as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to
complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the
expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology. The
company bases the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date
of acquisition on the time value of money and life science technology investment
risk factors. The company believes that the estimated purchased research and
development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of
acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third-party would pay for the
projects.

Acquisitions

In December 2006, the company’s
Analytical Technologies segment acquired Cohesive Technologies Inc., a
Massachusetts-based provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid
chromatography products. The purchase price totaled $71 million in cash, net of
cash acquired. Cohesive had revenues of $14 million in 2006 through the date of
acquisition. The acquisition of Cohesive enabled the segment to broaden its
in-line sample preparation capabilities. The purchase price exceeded the fair
value of the acquired net assets and, accordingly, $33 million was allocated to
goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

In addition to these acquisitions, the
company acquired a manufacturer of polymer web gauging products, a provider of
isotope ratio mass spectrometry instuments and a small manufacturer of on-line
elemental analyzer products, as well as a product line and a small distributor,
for aggregate consideration of $58 million.

Acquisitions

In March 2005, the Analytical
Technologies segment acquired Niton LLC, a Massachusetts-based provider of
portable X-ray analyzers to the metals, petrochemical and environmental markets
for $43 million in cash, net of cash acquired and including $2 million of
subsequent contingent purchase price payments based on the achievement of
post-acquisition results The acquisition of Niton enabled the segment to expand
its X-ray products to include a portable line. Niton’s revenues in 2004 totaled
$36 million. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net
assets and, accordingly, $17 million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is
tax deductible.

In April 2005, the company’s
Analytical Technologies segment completed the acquisition of Rupprecht and
Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P), a New York-based provider of continuous
particulate monitoring instrumentation for the ambient air, emissions monitoring
and industrial hygiene markets for $31 million in cash, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition of R&P enabled the segment to broaden its air monitoring
product offerings. R&P’s revenues totaled $17 million in 2004. The agreement
calls for payment of 7% of specified product sales in 2008 and 2009. The
purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets and,
accordingly, $16 million was allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax
deductible.

In May 2005, the company’s Laboratory
Products and Services segment acquired the Kendro Laboratory Products division
of SPX Corporation for $837 million, net of cash acquired, including transaction
costs. Kendro designs, manufactures, markets and services, on a global basis, a
wide range of laboratory equipment for sample preparation, processing and
storage, used primarily in life sciences and drug discovery laboratories as well
as clinical laboratories. The acquisition of Kendro broadened the segment’s
product offerings and access to customers. Kendro’s revenues were $371 million
in 2004. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired assets and,
accordingly, $453 million was allocated to goodwill, approximately $185 million
of which is tax deductible.

The company obtained short-term
bridge financing, which permitted it to borrow $570 million to partially fund
the purchase price of Kendro. The company used existing cash balances to fund
the remainder of the purchase price. Subsequently, the company used a
combination of short- and long-term debt instruments to refinance the bridge
loan (Note 10).

In August 2005, the company’s
Analytical Technologies segment acquired Ionalytics Corporation, a Canada-based
provider of a dynamic ion-filtering device used with mass spectrometers in
bioanalysis, proteomics and drug discovery for $25 million, net of cash
acquired. The acquisition of Ionalytics enabled the segment to broaden
its mass spectrometry product offerings. Ionalytics did not

revenues in 2004 as its focus was on commercially introducing its principal
product to market. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired
net assets and, accordingly, $7 million was allocated to goodwill, all of which
is tax deductible.

The company’s acquisitions have
historically been made at prices above the fair value of the acquired assets,
resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of synergies of combining the
businesses. These synergies include elimination of duplicative facilities,
functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing infrastructure such as
sales force, distribution channels and customer relations to expand sales of the
acquired businesses’ products; and use of the infrastructure of the acquired
businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products.

These acquisitions have been accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results
have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their
respective dates of acquisition. Allocation of the purchase price for
acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired
and, for acquisitions completed within the past year, is subject to adjustment
upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The company is not aware of
any information that indicates the final purchase price allocations will differ
materially from the preliminary estimates.

      charge for accelerated vesting of stock-based awards resulting from the
      change in control occurring at the date of the Fisher
    merger.

The company’s results would not have
been materially different from its reported results had the company’s other
acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2006 or 2005.

Restructuring
Activities at Acquired Businesses

The company has undertaken
restructuring activities at acquired businesses. These activities, which were
accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.
95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business
Combination,” have primarily included reductions in staffing levels and the
abandonment of excess facilities. In connection with these restructuring
activities, as part of the cost of acquisitions, the company established
reserves, primarily for severance and excess facilities. In accordance with EITF
Issue No. 95-3, the company finalizes its restructuring plans no later than one
year from the respective dates of the acquisitions. Upon finalization of
restructuring plans or settlement of obligations for less than the expected
amount, any excess reserves are reversed with a corresponding decrease in
goodwill or other intangible assets when no goodwill exists. Accrued acquisition
expenses are included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance
sheet. No accrued acquisition expenses have been established for 2007
acquisitions.

The remaining amounts accrued for
pre-2007 acquisitions include severance and facility obligations for various
facility consolidations, primarily related to the company’s merger with Fisher.
The amounts captioned as “other” primarily represent employee relocation,
contract termination and other exit costs. The severance and other costs are
expected to be paid in 2008. The abandoned facilities costs are expected to be
paid over the remaining term of the leases through 2010.

Dispositions

The company sold a small business for
nominal proceeds in 2007 and recorded a loss of $2 million. The company sold
non-core businesses and product lines for net cash proceeds of $9 million and $6
million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and recorded $0.6 million and $0.3
million of pre-tax gains in 2006 and 2005, respectively, which are included in
restructuring and other costs, net, in the accompanying statement of
income. The company sold its point of care and rapid diagnostics business
in 2005 (Note 16).

Business
      Segment and Geographical
Information

Following the merger with Fisher, the
company reorganized management responsibility and manages the combined company
in two segments. Prior year results have been reclassified to conform to the new
segments. The company’s segments are as follows:

Analytical Technologies: serves
research scientists, as well as customers in healthcare and clinical
laboratories, in manufacturing and in the field, with a suite of advanced
analytical technologies, including scientific instruments, robotics and software
for creating advanced integrated workflows. The segment also includes a range of
diagnostic reagents and instruments used by hospitals and reference
laboratories.

Laboratory Products and Services:
serves life science, healthcare and safety markets with a broad portfolio of
products and consumables used for routine laboratory processes, as well as a
range of biopharma outsourcing services such as clinical packaging and
biological sample management. The segment also includes the company’s extensive
customer channels network consisting of catalog, e-commerce and other sales
avenues.

The company’s management evaluates
operating segment performance based on operating income before certain charges
to cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting;
restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility
consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and
losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; amortization of
acquisition-related intangible assets; and charges for the acceleration of
stock-based compensation following the merger with Fisher. The company uses this
measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core
operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining
compensation.

The company acquired 5,660,000 shares
of Nanogen Inc. as a result of the Fisher merger. In December 2007, the company
recorded a loss of $8.9 million on the investment in Nanogen for other than
temporary impairment following a decline in the quoted fair market value of the
shares that occurred between April and December 2007.

In July 2004, the company received
3,220,000 shares of Newport Corporation common stock upon the sale of
Spectra-Physics to Newport. In June 2005, the company reached an agreement with
Newport under which Newport purchased all of the 3,220,000 shares of Newport
common stock. Newport purchased the shares for $13.56 per share, which resulted
in aggregate proceeds of $43.7 million. The company recorded a loss on the sale
of $1.3 million. The Newport shares had been subject to resale restrictions that
would have fully lapsed by January 2006.

As a result of the divestiture of
Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001, the company acquired shares of Thoratec
Corporation. The company sold 4,436,000 shares of Thoratec common stock during
2005 and realized gains of $28.9 million. At December 31, 2005, the company no
longer owned shares of Thoratec.

Gain (loss) on investments, net,
also includes portfolio gains from the company’s day-to-day investing
activities. In addition to gains from the sale of available-for-sale
investments, $1.5 million of gains arose in 2005 from the sale of investments
that had been classified as Other Assets.

permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including
restricted stock, stock options, stock bonus shares or performance-based shares,
as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors
or in limited circumstances, by the company’s option committee, which consists
of its chief executive officer. Options granted prior to July 2000 under these
plans vested over 0-10 years and had terms ranging from 3-12 years. Options
granted in or after July 2000 under these plans generally vested over 3-5 years
with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions.
The company practice is to grant options at fair market value. The company also
has a directors’ stock option plan that provides for the annual grant of stock
options of the company to outside directors. These options generally vest over
three years, assuming continued service on the board, and expire seven years
after the date of grant. The company generally issues new shares of its common
stock to satisfy option exercises. The merger with Fisher resulted in a change
in control and consequently, the vesting of substantially all of Thermo
Electron’s option and restricted stock awards accelerated except for those
options of the company’s chief executive officer who waived acceleration. As a
result, substantially all shares became immediately exercisable and shares
acquired upon exercise cease to be subject to transfer restrictions and the
company’s repurchase rights. The acceleration resulted in a pre-tax charge in
2006 of $36.7 million. Grants of stock options and restricted stock on or after
November 9, 2006, provide that upon a future change in control of the company
and qualifying termination of an option holder’s employment, all options and
time-based restricted stock awards held by the recipient become immediately
vested unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for
different treatment.

In December 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No.123R, “Share-based Payment,”

which requires
compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including employee share
options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS
No. 123R revises SFAS No. 123, as amended, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees.”

Effective January 1, 2006, the
company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified
prospective application transition method. Under this transition method, the
compensation cost recognized beginning January 1, 2006 includes
compensation cost for (i) all share-based payments granted prior to, but
not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and
(ii) all share-based payments granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based
on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123R. Compensation cost is recognized ratably over the requisite
vesting period or, for 2006 and later grants, to the retirement date for
retirement eligible employees, if earlier. Use of the date of retirement
eligibility to record the expense associated with awards granted to retirement
eligible employees did not materially affect the company’s results of operations
in the years ended 2007 and 2006. Prior period amounts have not been restated
for the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, SFAS
No. 109 and EITF Topic D-32, “Intraperiod Tax Allocation of the Tax Effect of
Pretax Income from Continuing Operations,” the company has elected to recognize
any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in capital in excess
of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after
considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company. The
company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related
to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by
the statutory tax rates. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach
for utilization of tax attributes. Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess
of par value on the accompanying balance sheet were $99.1 million and $17.4
million, respectively, in 2007 and 2006.

Stock Options

— The fair
value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with
respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on
the historical volatility of the company’s stock. The average expected life was
estimated using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” options as permitted
by SAB 107. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the
date of grant. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is
net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of
actual option forfeitures.

The weighted average assumptions used
in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:

The weighted average per share
grant-date fair values of options granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
$14.16, $12.40 and $9.04, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options
exercised during the same periods was $429.9 million, $224.3 million and
$20.7 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between
the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of
the option.

As a result of the merger with
Fisher, options to purchase 9,661,000 shares of Fisher common stock were
converted into options to purchase 19,322,000 shares of company stock. These
options had a fair value at the merger date of $394.5 million, which was
recorded as part of the merger consideration. Of the total options issued in
connection with the merger, options to purchase 1,621,000 shares of company
common stock were not fully vested. The fair value of these options ($15.1
million) was treated as a reduction of the merger consideration and is being
recorded as compensation cost over the vesting period.

Restricted Share Awards

— The
company awards to a number of key employees restricted company common stock or
restricted units that convert into an equivalent number of shares of common
stock assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. The awards generally
vest in equal annual installments over two to three years, assuming continued
employment, with some exceptions. The fair market value of the award at the time
of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. Recipients of
restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends,
whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to
receive dividend equivalents. The fair value of restricted share/unit awards is
determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the market value of
the company’s shares on the grant date.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the company
granted 62,500, 401,900 and 146,000 share awards respectively, at a weighted
average fair value of $54.97, $42.66 and $27.91, respectively, per share on the
grant date.

In 2006, the company awarded certain
key employees 134,000 restricted shares of common stock, the vesting of which is
contingent upon meeting certain operating targets. The company is recognizing
the cost of the awards over the contingent vesting periods of 4-5 years. The
actual vesting periods may be shorter if certain performance goals are achieved.
The ultimate value of the awards will be determined when they are earned. The
company established an initial value for the awards based on the fair market
value at the date of grant and marks them to market for changes in fair market
value. The company recognized $1.7 million and $0.2 million of cost associated
with the awards in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and at December 31, 2007, the
awards, net of forfeited shares, had a total value of $7.3 million. Should the
performance targets not be met, any recognized compensation cost would be
reversed.

As a result of the merger with Fisher,
restricted units convertible into 468,000 shares of Fisher common stock were
converted into restricted units convertible into 936,000 shares of company
stock. These restricted units had a fair value at the merger date of $36.4
million, which was recorded as part of the merger consideration. The restricted
units issued in connection with the merger were not fully vested. The fair value
of the unvested portion of these units ($29.1 million) was treated as a
reduction of the merger consideration and is being recorded as compensation cost
over the vesting period.

company’s restricted shares/units as of December 31, 2007 and changes during the
year then ended are presented below:

As of December 31, 2007, there was
$23.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested
restricted share awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of 2.1 years. The total fair value of shares vested during 2007,
2006 and 2005 was $20.7 million, $7.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
Prior to 2006, the company recorded the unrecognized compensation cost
associated with restricted stock awards as a separate account within
shareholders equity. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in 2006, the balance of
the deferred compensation was eliminated against capital in excess of par value
on the balance sheet.

Prior to January 1, 2006, the
company accounted for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, and
accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of stock
options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price at the
date of grant. Had compensation cost for awards granted after 1994 under the
company’s stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value
at the grant dates consistent with the method set forth under SFAS No. 123, and
had the fair value of awards been amortized on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, the effect on certain financial information of the company for
2005 would have been as follows:

Employee
Stock Purchase Plans

Qualifying employees are eligible to
participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company. Under
this program, beginning in 2006, shares may be purchased under the program at
95% of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares
purchased are not subject to a holding period. Prior to 2006, shares of the
company’s common stock could be purchased at 85% of the lower of the fair market
value at the beginning or end of the purchase period, and the shares purchased
were subject to a one-year resale restriction. Shares are purchased through
payroll deductions of up to 10% of each participating employee’s gross wages. In
early 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company issued 66,000, 59,000 and 115,000 shares,
respectively, of its common stock for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 plan years, which
ended on December 31.

The company had a plan in England under
which employees could purchase shares of the company’s common stock through
payroll deductions. Following the issuance of 30,000 shares under the plan in
2005, the plan was discontinued.

401(k)
Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans

The company’s 401(k) savings and
other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible
U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both
the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of
employee contributions. Certain of the company’s subsidiaries offer retirement
plans in lieu of participation in the company’s 401(k) savings plans. Company
contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In
2007, 2006 and 2005, the company charged to expense $56.8 million, $26.9 million
and $22.2 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution
plans.

Defined
Benefit Pension Plans

Employees of a number of non-U.S. and
certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans
are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. Following the
merger with Fisher, the company also has a cash balance pension plan that was
amended prior to the merger to eliminate future compensation credits and a
postretirement healthcare program for which certain employees are eligible to
participate. The costs of the healthcare program are funded on a self-insured
and insured-premium basis.

In accordance with SFAS No. 87,
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,” when an employer is acquired
as part of a merger, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan
assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the
projected benefit obligation is recognized as a plan asset. The recognition of a
new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously
existing unrecognized net gain or loss, (b) unrecognized prior service cost and
(c) unrecognized net transition obligation. Fisher’s pension obligations were
recorded by the company at the date of merger pursuant to these rules. The
funding of Fisher’s plans is not directly affected by the merger.

The company funds annually, at a
minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.
During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the company made contributions of approximately
$54.2 million, $50.3 million and $17.1 million, respectively.

Fisher also maintained a supplemental
non-qualified executive retirement program (SERP) for certain of its executives.
Accrual of future benefits under the plan ceased following the merger. The
benefit obligation related to this program is approximately $12 million at
December 31, 2007. Assets of approximately $7 million at December 31, 2007 are
set aside in a rabbi trust established for this program, which were included in
other assets in the accompanying balance sheet.

The discount rate reflects the rate the
company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would
provide cash sufficient to settle its current

pension
obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors,
including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and
the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the
company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with
maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate
the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.

The expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds
invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the
projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan
assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset
classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition,
the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other
professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.

Asset management objectives include
maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and
market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future
benefit payment requirements.

During the second quarter of 2005, the
company merged two defined benefit plans in the U.K. and provided the
participating employees with a defined contribution plan while limiting future
benefits under the combined defined benefit plan. The transaction met the
criteria of a plan curtailment although no gain or loss resulted. In connection
with the transaction, the company contributed $10.9 million to the combined U.K.
defined benefit plan.

Contributions are estimated at between
$20 and $30 million for 2008.

at December 31, 2007. Benefit payments will depend on future employment and
compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other

reduce interest rate and market risk. Maturities are managed so that sufficient
liquidity exists to meet immediate and future benefit payment
requirements.

allocation at the respective year ends by asset category was as
follows:

The company estimates the degree to
which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on
expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance
for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more
likely than not go unused. At December 31, 2007, $174.1 million of the company’s
valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for which any subsequently
recognized tax benefits will reduce goodwill of an acquired business. Upon the
January 1, 2009 adoption of SFAS No. 141(R), however, changes in deferred tax
asset valuation allowances following an acquisition generally will affect income
tax expense, including any changes associated with acquisitions that occurred
prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R).

At December 31, 2007, the company had
federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $247.7 million,
$672.6 million and $684.1 million, respectively. Use of the carryforwards is
limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. The federal and
state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2008 through 2027. Of
the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $86.4 million expire in the years
2008 through 2027, and the remainder do not expire. The company also had $98.9
million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2007,
which expire in the years 2008 through 2017.

A provision has not been made for
U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $1.88 billion of undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the
U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested
overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the
U.S. without an associated net tax cost.

Adoption
of FASB Interpretation No. 48

The company adopted the provisions
of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 (FIN 48 is initially described in Note 1). As a
result of the implementation of FIN 48, the company recognized no material
adjustment in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As of the adoption
date of January 1, 2007, the company had $87.7 million of unrecognized tax
benefits, of which $35.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax
rate and the remaining $52.1 million, if recognized, would decrease goodwill. As
of the adoption date the company had accrued interest expense and penalties
related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $5.3 million, which is included in
the $87.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2007, the
company had $79.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $38.8 million,
if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate and the remaining $40.4
million, if recognized, would decrease goodwill. As of December 31, 2007 the
company had accrued interest expense and penalties related to the unrecognized
tax benefits of $5.3 million, which is included in the $79.2 million of
unrecognized tax benefits. Upon the January 1, 2009 adoption of SFAS No. 141(R)
however, changes in unrecognized tax benefits following an acquisition generally
will affect income tax expense, including any changes associated with
acquisitions that occurred prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R). The
company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
as a component of tax expense.

ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The company conducts business globally
and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income
tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to
examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major
jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, the
company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S.,
income tax examinations for years before 2001.

During 2007, the statute of limitations
on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in a $2.3 million
decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, $2.0 million of which
reduced goodwill and $0.3 million of which reduced income tax
expense.

During 2007, the company settled audits
of the 2003 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries which
resulted in a $2.6 million decrease in both the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits and goodwill. The company also settled audits of the 1994-1997 tax
years of certain German subsidiaries which resulted in a $7.1 million decrease
in both the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and goodwill. The company is
currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2001 to 2004 tax
years. The examination is at the appeals level of the IRS. The company does not
currently expect any significant changes to previously recorded unrecognized tax
benefits. The IRS is also auditing the 2004 and 2005 pre-acquisition tax years
of certain Fisher subsidiaries. It is likely that the examination phase of these
audits will be completed within twelve months. There have been no significant
changes to the status of these examinations during 2007, and the company does
not currently expect any significant changes to previously recorded unrecognized
tax benefits.

Earnings
      per Share (continued)

Under EITF No. 04-08 “The Effect of
Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” and EITF
No. 90-19 “Convertible Bonds with Issuer Option to Settle for Cash upon
Conversion,” because of the company’s obligation to settle the par value of its
convertible notes in cash, the company is not required to include any shares
underlying the convertible notes in its diluted weighted average shares
outstanding until the average stock price per share for the period exceeds the
$23.73, $29.55, and $40.20 conversion price for the 2.50% Senior Convertible
Notes due 2023, the Floating Rate Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033 and the
3.25% Senior Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024, respectively, and only to
the extent of the additional shares the company may be required to issue in the
event the company’s conversion obligation exceeds the principal amount of the
notes or debentures converted. At such time, only the number of shares that
would be issuable (under the treasury stock method of accounting for share
dilution) are included, which is based upon the amount by which the average
stock price exceeds the conversion price.

The table below discloses the effect of
increases in the company’s stock price on the amount of shares to be included in
the earnings per share calculation. The securities are convertible only if the
common stock price equals or exceeds the trigger price. The table assumes normal
conversion for the 2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023, the Floating Rate
Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033 and the 3.25% Senior Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2024 in which the principal amount is paid in cash, and

Short-term
      Investments (continued)

The cost of available-for-sale
investments that were sold was based on specific identification in determining
realized gains and losses recorded in the accompanying statement of income. The
net gain on the sale of available-for-sale investments resulted from gross
realized gains of $0.7 million and $35.1 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively,
and gross realized losses of $9.0 million and $1.3 million in 2007 and 2005,
respectively.

The company’s investments in auction
rate securities are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their
variable interest rates. The interest rates generally reset every 7 to 28 days.
All income generated from these investments has been recorded as interest
income.

In addition to available-for-sale
investments, the company had $2.0 million and $3.5 million of trading
securities, consisting of debt and equity securities, at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. Trading gains associated with this portfolio were $0.2 in
2007 and were not material in 2006.

See Note 13 for fair value
information pertaining to the company’s long-term obligations.

Short-term obligations and current
maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included
$11.4 million and $467.3 million at year-end 2007 and 2006, respectively, of
short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of
the company’s subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate for short-term
borrowings was 1.75% and 5.6% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In
addition to available borrowings under the company’s five-year revolving credit
agreements and a money market loan fund arrangement, all discussed below, the
company had unused lines of credit of $120.8 million as of December 31, 2007.
These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured
borrowings at various interest rates.

On November 9, 2006, in connection
with the merger with Fisher, the company entered into a new $1 billion
multi-currency credit facility, discussed below. The company used proceeds from
this facility to prepay Fisher debt. The company also terminated its $250
million revolving credit and 175 million euro credit facilities. There were no
outstanding balances when those facilities were terminated.

In connection with the Fisher
merger, the company assumed three issuances of convertible debt as well as two
issuances of fixed-rate debt, described below. The company became a co-obligor
of this debt. The debt was recorded at the merger date at its fair value. The
excess of the fair value over the principal value of the convertible debt, or
$546.8 million, was deemed to arise from the value of the conversion features
and was allocated to capital in excess of par value.

On December 15, 2006, the company provided a notice to the holders of the 3.25%
subordinated convertible debentures due 2007 that the debentures would be
redeemed on January 5, 2007. The holders’ right to convert the debentures into
common shares of the company expired on December 28, 2006. The holders of $69.8
million in aggregate principal amount converted their debentures into common
shares. On January 5, 2007, the remaining debentures totaling $7.4 million in
aggregate principal amount were redeemed at par plus accrued
interest.

Credit
Facilities

In November 2006, the company entered
into a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a bank
group that provides for up to $1 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving
credit that will expire in August 2012. The agreement allows for the company to
request an extension of the facility until August 2013. The company also has the
right to request an increase in the size of the facility by up to $500 million.
The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on
the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The rate at
December 31, 2007, was between 4.49% and 4.6% (depending on duration) under the

more
favorable of the two rates. The Revolving Credit Facility allows for the
issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing.
The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events
of default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenant
requires the company to maintain total leverage below a certain maximum level.
The credit agreement permits the company to use the facility for working
capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other
securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate purposes. As of
December 31, 2007, there were no borrowings under the revolver and $44.8 million
in letters of credit outstanding, resulting in $955.2 million of borrowings
available under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Money
Market Loans

The company has an uncommitted line of
credit of up to $250 million through a series of short-term money market loans
funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such money market loans
typically have maturity periods of between one and three months, however they
can have longer durations as the market will bear. Furthermore, they bear
varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate at the time
of issuance. As of December 31, 2007, the company did not have any outstanding
borrowings under this line.

2.50%
Senior Convertible Notes due 2023

At the closing date of the merger with
Fisher, the company assumed $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50%
Senior Convertible Notes due 2023. Interest on the notes is payable on April 1
and October 1 of each year. The notes are convertible at the option of the
holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $23.73 per share. The
company will be required to deliver cash to holders upon conversion, up to the
principal amount of the notes converted. The company will have the option to
satisfy any amount of conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount in
cash and/or shares of common stock. The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in
part, at the company’s option on or after October 2, 2010, at 100% of the
principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, holders of the notes have
the option, subject to certain conditions, to require the company to purchase
any notes held by them for 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest on
October 1, 2010, October 1, 2015, and October 1, 2020, or upon a change of
control.

Floating
Rate Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033

At the closing date of the merger with
Fisher, the company assumed $344.4 million aggregate principal amount of
Floating Rate Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033. Interest on the notes is
payable on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year at an
annual rate of 90-day LIBOR minus 1.25% (3.45% as of December 31, 2007).
Additional quarterly interest equal to 0.0625% of the market value of the notes
will be paid commencing with the quarterly interest period beginning December
15, 2009, if the market value of the notes during specified testing periods is
120% or more of the principal value. The notes are convertible at the option of
the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $29.55 per share.
The company will be required to deliver cash to holders upon conversion, up to
the principal amount of notes converted. The company will have the option to
satisfy any amount of conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount in
cash and/or shares of common stock. The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in
part, at the company’s option on or after March 15, 2010, at 100% of the
principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, holders of the notes have
the option, subject to certain conditions, to require the company to purchase

December 15, 2008, March 15, 2010, December 15, 2014, December 15, 2019,

Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024

At the closing date of the merger with
Fisher, the company assumed $330.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25%
Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024. Interest on the notes is payable
on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The notes are convertible at the option
of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $40.20 per
share. The company will be required to deliver cash to holders upon conversion,
up to the principal amount of notes converted. The company will have the option
to satisfy any amount of conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount
in cash and/or shares of common stock. The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in
part, at the company’s option, on or after March 2, 2011, at 100% of the
principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, holders of the notes have
the option, subject to certain conditions, to require the company to purchase
any notes held by them for 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest on
March 1, 2011, March 1, 2016 and March 1, 2021, or upon a change of

5%
Senior Notes due 2015

The company has $250 million principal
amount of 5% Senior Notes due 2015. Interest on the notes is payable on June 1
and December 1 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at any time at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole
premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and
negative covenants.

Prior to issuing this debt, the company
entered into forward starting pay fixed swap agreements with several banks to
mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt
offering. Based on the company’s conclusion that a debt offering was probable
and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year
term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate
interest payments on $250 million of principal amount of the 10-year fixed-rate
debt issue (or any subsequent refinancing of such debt). The change in the fair
value of the hedge upon termination was $2.0 million, net of tax, and was
classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items within
shareholders’ equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of
the debt through 2015.

5/8% Senior Notes due 2008

The company has $128.7 million
principal amount of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2008. Interest on the notes is
payable on April 30 and October 30 of each year. The notes may be redeemed at
any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified
make-whole premium plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain
affirmative and negative covenants.

During 2002, the company entered
into interest-rate swap arrangements for the $128.7 million principal amount of
notes with the objective of reducing interest costs. The arrangements provide
that the company will receive a fixed interest rate of 7 5/8%, and will pay a
variable rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 2.19% (5.44% as of December 31, 2007). The
swaps have terms expiring at the maturity of the debt. The swaps are designated
as fair-value hedges and as such, are carried at fair value, which resulted in
an increase in both current assets and current maturities of long-term debt of
$1.6 million at December 31, 2007 and an increase in both other long-term assets
and long-term debt of $0.6 million at December 31, 2006. The swap arrangements
are with different counterparties than the holders of the underlying debt.
Management believes that any credit risk associated with the swaps is remote
based on the creditworthiness of the financial institutions issuing the
swaps.

Commitments
      and Contingencies (continued)

Purchase
Obligations

The company has entered into
unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that
include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and
legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or
minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions;
and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude
agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount
of the company’s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $151.6 million at
December 31, 2007 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be
settled during 2008.

Letters
of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments

Outstanding letters of credit and bank
guarantees totaled $98.5 million at December 31, 2007, including $3.3 million
for businesses that have been sold. The expiration of these credits and
guarantees ranges through 2030.

Outstanding surety bonds and other
guaranties totaled $29.7 million at December 31, 2007. The expiration of these
bonds and guaranties ranges through 2011.

The letters of credit, bank guarantees
and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the
holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank
guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as
contractually required. With respect to letters of credit, guarantees and surety
bonds that were issued for businesses that were sold, the buyer is obligated to
indemnify the company in the event such letters of credit and/or surety bonds
are drawn.

In connection with the sale of
businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual
obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with
respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third-party to a
transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer
defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be
liable to the third-party for such obligations. However, in such event, the
company would be entitled to indemnification by the buyer.

The company has funding commitments
totaling $11.0 million at December 31, 2007, related to investments it
owns.

Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain
transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the
other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that
were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain
environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of
such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where
appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than
obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the
company has not made significant payments for these
indemnifications.

In connection with the company’s
efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has
vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the
company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor
under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if
a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to
make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company
believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in
the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of
operations.

Commitments
      and Contingencies (continued)

In connection with the sale of products
in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations
affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the
intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against
third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to
make material payments under such provisions.

Litigation
and Related Contingencies

On September 3, 2004, Applera
Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments filed a
lawsuit against the company in U.S. federal court. These plaintiffs allege that
the company’s mass spectrometer systems, including its triple quadrupole and
certain of its ion trap systems, infringe a patent of the plaintiffs. The
plaintiffs seek damages, including treble damages for alleged willful
infringement, attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest and injunctive relief. In
the opinion of management, an unfavorable outcome of this matter could have a
material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its
results of operations and cash flows.

On December 8, 2004 and February 23,
2005, the company asserted in two lawsuits against a combination of Applera
Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments that one
or more of these parties infringe two patents of the company.

There are various other lawsuits and
claims pending against the company involving contract, product liability and
other issues. In view of the company’s financial condition and the accruals
established for related matters, management does not believe that the ultimate
liability, if any, related to these matters will have a material adverse effect
on the company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

The company establishes a liability
that is an estimate of amounts needed to pay damages in the future for events
that have already occurred. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s
judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially
determined estimates. The reserve estimates are adjusted as additional
information becomes known or payments are made.

The company accrues the most likely
amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of
probable loss can be estimated. The range of probable loss for product
liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters at December
31, 2007, was approximately $212 million to $330 million on an undiscounted
basis. The portion of these liabilities assumed in the merger with Fisher was
recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger, $131 million at
December 31, 2007. The reserve includes estimated defense costs and is gross of
estimated amounts due from insurers of $75 million at December 31, 2007, also
recorded at their fair value at the date of merger. The company’s reserve for
these matters in total, including the discounted Fisher liabilities, was $145
million at December 31, 2007. The assets and liabilities assumed at the
acquisition date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of
expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free
rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted
average discount rate of 4.67%). The discount on the liabilities of
approximately $76 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $46
million (net discount $30 million) is being accreted to interest expense over
the expected settlement period. In addition to the above reserves, as of
December 31, 2007, the company had product liability reserves of $9 million
(undiscounted) relating to divested businesses. Although the company believes
that the amounts reserved and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate
based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates,
the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a
considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could
vary materially. For example, there are pending lawsuits with certain of
Fisher’s insurers concerning which state’s laws should apply to the insurance
policies and how such laws affect the policies. Should these actions resolve
unfavorably, the estimated amount due from insurers of $75 million would require
adjustment that could be material to the company’s results of operations.
Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with
respect to any losses incurred. The collectibility of amounts due from its
insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as
well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the
financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing
basis.

Commitments
      and Contingencies (continued)

The company is currently involved in
various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental
matters, principally at businesses acquired in the merger with Fisher. The
company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation
matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties
regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup
methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for
environmental remediation matters relate to the costs of permit requirements and
installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other
remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the
company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period
presented. The company’s liability for environmental matters associated with
businesses acquired in the merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair value and
as such, was discounted to its present value. The company records accruals for
environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of
environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The
company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports
prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and
experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these
estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and
maintenance of cleanup sites. Having assumed these environmental liabilities in
the merger with Fisher, the company was required to discount the estimate of
loss to fair (present) value, $23 million. This fair value was ascribed by using
a discount rate of 4.73%, which was the risk free interest rate for monetary
assets with maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. The
discount of $10.0 million is being accreted by charges to interest expense over
the estimated maturity period of 30 years. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
environmental liability was approximately $23 million and $24 million,
respectively.

Management believes that this accrual
is adequate for the environmental remediation costs the company expects to
incur. As a result, the company believes that the ultimate liability with
respect to environmental remediation matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
However, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs
due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes
in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation
technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could
have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. Although these environmental remediation liabilities
do not include third-party recoveries, the company may be able to bring
indemnification claims against third parties for liabilities relating to certain
sites.

Common
      and Preferred Stock

At December 31, 2007, the company
had reserved 63,652,301 unissued shares of its common stock for possible
issuance under stock-based compensation plans and for possible conversion of the
company’s convertible debentures.

The company has 50,000 shares of
authorized but unissued $100 par value preferred stock.

The company has distributed rights
under a shareholder rights plan adopted by the company’s Board of Directors to
holders of outstanding shares of the company’s common stock. Each right entitles
the holder to purchase one hundred-thousandth of a share (a Unit) of Series B
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $100 par value, at a purchase price of
$200 per Unit, subject to adjustment. The rights will not be exercisable until
the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a
person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person) has
acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of the outstanding shares of common stock (the Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii)
10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer
for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock.

In the event that a person becomes
the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock,
except pursuant to an offer for all outstanding shares of common stock that at
least 75% of the Board of Directors determines to be fair to, and otherwise in
the best interests of, stockholders, each holder of a right (except for the
Acquiring Person) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, that
number of shares of common stock (or, in certain circumstances, units of
preferred stock, cash, property or other securities of the company) which equals
the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price
of the common stock. In the event that, at any time after any person has become
an Acquiring Person, (i) the company is acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction in which the company is not the surviving
corporation or its common stock is changed or exchanged (other than a merger
that follows an offer approved by the Board of Directors), or (ii) 50% or
more of the company’s assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each
holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) shall thereafter have the
right to receive, upon exercise, the number of shares of common stock of the
acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the right divided by
one-half of the current market price of such common stock.

At any time until the Stock Acquisition
Date, the company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of
$.01 per right (payable in cash or stock). The rights expire on September 29,
2015, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged.

As a result of the merger with
Fisher, warrants to purchase 1,653,585 shares of Fisher common stock were
converted into warrants to purchase 3,307,170 shares of company common stock.
These warrants had a fair value of $113.2 million at the merger date, which was
recorded as part of the merger consideration. As of December 31, 2007, there
were warrants outstanding to purchase 3,307,170 shares of company common stock
at an exercise price of $4.83 per share. All of the outstanding warrants were
exercised in January 2008.

(continued)

The fair value of the notes receivable
(principally a note receivable from Newport Corporation received in connection
with the sale of a business) was determined based on borrowing rates available
to companies of comparable credit worthiness at December 31, 2006. In February
2007, the company received full payment of the note receivable from
Newport.

The fair value of long-term obligations
was determined based on quoted market prices and on borrowing rates available to
the company at the respective year ends.

The notional amounts of forward
currency-exchange contracts outstanding totaled $218.5 million and $72.2 million
at year-end 2007 and 2006, respectively. The fair value of such contracts is the
estimated amount that the company would receive upon liquidation of the
contracts, taking into account the change in currency exchange

Restructuring
      and Other Costs, Net

Restructuring and other costs recorded
in 2005 were primarily for reductions in staffing levels at existing businesses
resulting from the integration of Kendro and the consolidation of two facilities
in Texas. The 2005 costs also include charges associated with actions initiated
prior to 2005 that could not be recorded until incurred and adjustments to
previously provided reserves due to changes in estimates of sub-tenant rentals
from abandoned facilities. Restructuring costs in 2006 included charges to close
a plant in Massachusetts and consolidate its operations with those of an
acquired Kendro facility in North Carolina, charges for consolidation of a U.K.
facility into an existing factory in Germany, the move of manufacturing
operations in New Mexico to other plants in the U.S. and Europe and remaining
costs of prior actions. Restructuring costs in 2007 include charges for the
consolidation of anatomical pathology operations currently in Pennsylvania with
a Fisher site in Michigan, as well as consolidation of other U.S. operations and
consolidation of sites in the

consolidations principally included the planned move of a manufacturing site in
France to Germany. The segment also recorded a loss of $2 million on the sale of
a small business.

Corporate

The company recorded $7 million of
restructuring and other charges at its corporate office in 2007. These costs
consisted of $8 million of cash costs which were primarily for merger-related
expenses and retention agreements with certain Fisher employees. Retention costs
were accrued ratably over the period the employees worked to qualify for the
payment, generally through November 2007. The corporate office also recorded a
net gain of $1 million primarily related to pension plan

Discontinued
      Operations

Subsequent to the 2006 acquisition of
GV Instruments Limited (GVI), the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) commenced an
investigation of the transaction to determine whether it qualified for
consideration under the UK Enterprise Act. On December 15, 2006, the OFT
referred the transaction to the UK Competition Commission for further
investigation under the Enterprise Act to determine whether the transaction had
resulted in, or may be expected to result in, a substantial lessening of
competition within any market in the UK for goods or services, particularly gas
isotope ratio mass spectrometers (Gas IRMS), thermal ionization mass
spectrometers (TIMS) and multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometers. The Competition Commission published its final report on May 30,
2007, concluding that the company’s acquisition of GVI would lead to a
substantial lessening of competition in the UK in the markets for Gas IRMS and
TIMS products. The Competition Commission has further concluded that a
divestiture remedy was appropriate and has therefore required the company to
divest of either GVI as a whole, or its Gas IRMS and TIMS assets (which together
comprise the majority of the business), to purchasers approved by the
Competition Commission. As a result of this divestiture requirement the company
recorded after-tax impairment charges in 2007 totaling $29 million. The loss
primarily represents non-cash charges to reduce the carrying value of the
business to estimated disposal value. Due to the immateriality of the operating
results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not
reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to
discontinued operations. In February 2008, the company completed the sale of
GVI’s two principal product lines that required divestiture.

Aside from the impairment loss related
to the divestiture of GVI, the company had after-tax gains of $10 million in
2007 from discontinued operations, primarily from the receipt of additional
proceeds from the sale of a business in 2000 and a revision to the company’s
estimate of loss from litigation related to a divested business.

During 2006, the company committed to a
plan to dispose of Genevac Limited (Genevac), a legacy Fisher business that is a
manufacturer of solvent evaporation technology. The decision followed the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) consent order that required divesture of Genevac
for FTC approval of the Thermo Fisher merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act. Genevac was sold in April 2007, for net proceeds of
$21 million in cash. The results of discontinued operations also include the
results of Systems Manufacturing Corporation (SMC), a legacy Fisher business
that provides consoles, workstations and server enclosures for information
technology operations and data centers. SMC was sold in July 2007 for cash
proceeds of $2.5 million. The operating results of Genevac and SMC were not
material for the 2007 period prior to their sale. The assets and liabilities of
these entities were not material at December 31, 2006. For the period from
November 9, 2006 through December 31, 2006, these entities had net income of
$0.5 million which is classified as income from discontinued operations in the
accompanying statement of income.

The company had $2.1 million of gains
from the disposal of discontinued operations in 2006, including primarily
additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004, net of a
charge for settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a divested
business.

In 2005, the company recorded after-tax
gains of $24.9 million from the disposal of discontinued operations. In
September 2005, the Analytical Technologies segment sold its point of care and
rapid diagnostics business for $53.1 million in cash after determining it was
not a strategic fit in the long-term. The company recorded an after-tax gain of
$16.8 million as a result of the sale. Revenues and pre-tax loss of the divested
business totaled $26.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in 2005 through
the date of sale. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this
business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the
historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In
August 2005, the company sold a building of a previously divested business for
net proceeds of $7.3 million in cash, which approximated its carrying value. In
addition, the company recorded after-tax gains of $8.1 million from the disposal
of discontinued operations. The gains represent additional proceeds from the
sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real
estate and post-closing adjustments, and settlement of litigation and an
arbitration award related to divested businesses.
