3)  REGULATION

-

Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local
agencies.  The following includes the primary regulations impacting
Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s businesses.

Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)

-

Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005)

- Alliant Energy is
registered with FERC as a public utility holding company, pursuant to PUHCA
2005, and is required to maintain certain records and to report certain
transactions involving its public utilities and other entities regulated by
FERC.  IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC under PUHCA 2005
for various issues including, but not limited to, affiliate transactions, public
utility mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, issuance of securities (IPL
only) and books and records requirements.

Energy
Policy Act

- The Energy Policy Act requires creation of an Electric
Reliability Organization (ERO) to provide oversight by FERC.  FERC
designated the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as the
overarching ERO.  The Midwest Reliability Organization, which is a
regional member of NERC, has direct responsibility for mandatory electric
reliability standards for IPL and WPL.

Federal
Power Act

- FERC also has jurisdiction, under the Federal Power Act, over
certain electric utility facilities and operations, electric wholesale and
transmission rates, dividend payments and accounting practices of IPL and
WPL.

Electric
Wholesale Rates

- Corporate Services, as agent for both IPL and WPL, has
received wholesale electric market-based rate authority from
FERC.  Market-based rate authorization allows for wholesale sales of
electricity within the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO)
energy and ancillary services markets and in bilateral markets, based on the
market value of the transactions.

Electric
Transmission Rates

- FERC regulates the rates charged for electric
transmission facilities used in interstate commerce.  Neither IPL nor
WPL own or operate electric transmission facilities; however, both IPL and WPL
pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system based upon
FERC-regulated rates.  IPL relies primarily upon the use of the ITC
Midwest LLC (ITC) transmission system.  Refer to “Other Matters -
Other Future Considerations - IPL’s Electric Transmission Service Charges” in
MDA for additional information regarding transmission service charges from ITC,
including a FERC 206 complaint filed by IPL against ITC in 2008.  WPL
relies primarily upon the use of the ATC transmission system.

National
Gas Act

- FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of
natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act.  Under
the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over certain natural gas facilities and
operations of IPL and WPL.

Environmental

- -

The EPA administers certain federal regulatory programs and has
delegated the administration of other environmental regulatory programs to the
applicable state environmental agencies.  In general, the state
agencies have jurisdiction over air and water quality, hazardous substances
management and transportation, and solid waste management
requirements.  In certain cases, the state environmental agencies have
delegated the administration of environmental programs to local
agencies.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to these
environmental regulations as a result of their current and past
operations.

IUB

- -

IPL is subject to regulation by the IUB related to its operations in
Iowa for various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and
standards of service, accounting requirements and approval of the location and
construction of electric generating facilities.

Retail
Utility Base Rates

- IPL files periodic requests with the IUB for retail
rate relief.  These filings are based on historical test
periods.  The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain
known and measurable capital additions placed in service by IPL within nine
months from the end of the historical test period and certain known and
measurable operating and maintenance expenses incurred by IPL within 12 months
of the commencement of the proceeding.  The IUB must decide on
requests for retail rate relief within 10 months of the date of the application
for which relief is filed, or the interim rates granted become
permanent.  Interim retail rates can be placed in effect 10 days after
the rate application filing, subject to refund, and must be based on past
precedent.


Retail
Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms

- IPL’s retail electric and natural
gas tariffs contain an automatic adjustment clause for changes in prudently
incurred commodity costs required to serve its retail customers.  Any
over/under collection of commodity costs for each given month are automatically
reflected in future billings to retail customers.

New
Electric Generating Facilities

- A Certificate of Public Convenience, Use
and Necessity (GCU Certificate) application is required to be filed with the IUB
for construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in
Iowa with 25 megawatts (MW) or more of capacity.

Advance
Rate Making Principles

- Iowa Code §476.53 (formerly referred to as HF
577) provides Iowa utilities with rate making principles prior to making certain
generation investments in Iowa.  Under Iowa Code §476.53, IPL must
file for, and the IUB must provide, rate making principles for electric
generating facilities located in Iowa that have received construction approval
including new base-load (primarily defined as nuclear or coal-fired generation)
facilities with a capacity of 300 MW or more, combined-cycle natural gas-fired
facilities of any size and renewable generating resources, such as wind
facilities, of any size.  Upon approval of rate making principles by
the IUB, IPL must either build the facility under the approved rate making
principles, or not at all.

Public
Service Commission of Wisconsin

(PSCW)

- -

Alliant Energy is subject to regulation by the PSCW for the type and
amount of Alliant Energy’s investments in non-utility businesses and other
affiliated interest activities, among other issues.  WPL is also
subject to regulation by the PSCW related to its operations in Wisconsin for
various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards
of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities,
approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities and
certain other additions and extensions to facilities.

Retail
Utility Base Rates

- WPL files periodic requests with the PSCW for retail
rate relief.  These filings are required to be based on
forward-looking test periods.  There is no statutory time limit for
the PSCW to decide retail rate requests.  However, the PSCW attempts
to process base retail rate cases in approximately 10 months and has the ability
to approve interim retail rate relief, subject to refund, if
necessary.

Retail
Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms -

Electric

- - WPL’s retail electric rates are based on estimates of annual fuel-related
costs (includes fuel and purchased power energy costs) anticipated during the
test period.  During each electric retail rate proceeding, the PSCW
sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel-related costs used to
determine rates in such proceeding.  If WPL’s actual fuel-related
costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges, the PSCW can authorize an
adjustment to future retail electric rates.

The fuel
monitoring ranges set by the PSCW consist of unit cost variances between
monitoring levels and actual unit costs and include three different ranges based
on monthly costs, cumulative costs and revised forecasted annual costs during
the test-year period.  In order for WPL, or others, to initiate a
proceeding to change rates related to fuel-related costs during the test period,
WPL, or others, must demonstrate: a) that either 1) any actual monthly costs
during the test period exceeded the monthly ranges or 2) the actual cumulative
costs to date during the test period exceeded the cumulative ranges; and b) that
the annual projected costs (that include cumulative actual costs) for the test
period also exceed the annual ranges.  In December 2009, the PSCW
approved an order continuing WPL’s fuel monitoring ranges of plus or minus 8%
for the monthly range; for the cumulative range, plus or minus 8% for the first
month, plus or minus 5% for the second month, and plus or minus 2% for the
remaining months of the monitoring period; and plus or minus 2% for the annual
range.  For fuel-only retail rate changes, the PSCW attempts to
provide interim changes effective within 21 days of notice to
customers.  There is no statutory time limit for final fuel-only
retail rate change decisions.

Natural
Gas

- WPL’s retail natural gas tariffs contain an automatic adjustment
clause for changes in prudently incurred natural gas costs required to serve its
retail gas customers.  Any over/under collection of natural gas costs
for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail
customers.

New
Electric Generating Facilities

- A Certificate of Authority (CA)
application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of
any new electric generating facility with a capacity of less than 100
MW.  A Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN)
application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of
any new electric generating facility with a capacity of 100 MW or
more.  In addition, WPL’s ownership and operation of electric
generating facilities (including those located in Minnesota) to serve Wisconsin
customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the PSCW.


In June
2008, WPL filed a CPCN application with the PSCW to construct WPL’s Bent Tree -
Phase I wind project, which proposed the installation of a 200 MW wind
generating facility in Minnesota.  In a November 2008 interim order,
the PSCW interpreted the CA and CPCN statutes in relationship to constructing
more than 100 MW of capacity outside of Wisconsin, an issue that is not
specifically addressed in either the CA or the CPCN statute.  The PSCW
determined that WPL’s Bent Tree - Phase I application must be reviewed under the
CA statute and not the CPCN statute, and processed WPL’s application as a CA
application.

In August
2009, Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group, Inc. and Citizens Utility Board filed a
Petition for Review with the Circuit Court of Dane County, Wisconsin seeking
judicial review of: 1) the PSCW’s November 2008 interim order that determined
WPL’s application for the Bent Tree - Phase I wind project must be reviewed
under the CA statute and not the CPCN statute; and 2) the PSCW’s July 2009 final
order that granted WPL a CA to construct the Bent Tree - Phase I wind
project.  In October 2009, the PSCW filed a motion to dismiss the
petition.

Advance
Rate Making Principles

- Wisconsin Statutes §196.371 (formerly referred
to as Act 7) provides Wisconsin utilities with the opportunity to request rate
making principles prior to the purchase or construction of any nuclear or
fossil-fueled electric generating facility or renewable generating resource,
such as a wind facility, utilized to serve Wisconsin customers.  WPL
is not obligated to file for or accept authorized rate making principles under
Wisconsin Statutes §196.371.  WPL can proceed with an approved project
under traditional rate making terms.

Minnesota
Public Utilities Commission (MPUC)

- -

IPL is subject to regulation by the MPUC related to its operations in
Minnesota for various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates
and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds
of securities, periodic approval of IPL’s capital structure, and approval of the
location and construction of electric generating facilities located in Minnesota
with a capacity in excess of 50 MW.

Retail
Utility Rates

- Requests for retail rate relief can be based on either
historical or projected data and interim retail rates are
permitted.  Unless otherwise ordered, the MPUC must reach a final
decision within 10 months of filing for retail rate relief.  In
February 2010, legislation (H.R. 2798 and S. 2519) was introduced in the
Minnesota legislature that would allow a utility to implement interim retail
rates only when the MPUC finds an immediate and compelling necessity exists for
interim rate relief.  If the MPUC finds that interim rate relief is
necessary, the MPUC may authorize an interim rate schedule under which the
utility’s revenues would be increased by an amount deemed necessary to prevent
harm to the public or utility.  Alliant Energy and IPL are currently
unable to determine the ultimate impact of this proposed legislation on their
financial condition and results of operations.

Refer to
Notes 1(b), 1(h), 2 and 12(e) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements;” and “Rate Matters,” “Environmental Matters” and
“Legislative Matters” in MDA for additional information regarding regulation and
utility rate matters.

IPL and
WPL provide electric utility service to a diversified base of retail customers
in several industries, with the largest concentrations in the food
manufacturing, chemical (including ethanol) and paper
industries.  IPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed
under base rates established by the IUB or MPUC that include recovery of
purchased electric capacity costs, electric transmission service costs and other
costs required to serve customers.  IPL’s electric production fuel and
energy purchases costs are recovered pursuant to fuel adjustment
clauses.  WPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under
base rates established by the PSCW that include recovery of electric production
fuel and purchased energy costs, purchased electric capacity costs, electric
transmission service costs and other costs required to serve
customers.  The electric fuel rules in Wisconsin allow the PSCW to
authorize rate increases/decreases if electric production fuel and energy
purchases costs exceed or fall below established fuel monitoring
ranges.

Wholesale
customers in the above table, which primarily consist of municipalities and
rural electric cooperatives, are billed under wholesale service
agreements.  These agreements include standardized pricing mechanisms
that are detailed in tariffs approved by FERC through wholesale rate case
proceedings.

In
addition, IPL and WPL have bulk power customers, included in “Other customers”
in the above table, that are billed according to negotiated, long-term
customer-specific contracts, pursuant to FERC-approved tariffs.


Seasonality

-

Electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally
occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning
requirements.  In 2009, the maximum peak hour demands for Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL were 5,491 MW, 2,981 MW and 2,558 MW, respectively, all on
June 23, 2009.

Competition

-

Retail electric customers in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota currently do
not have the ability to choose their electric supplier.  However, IPL
and WPL attempt to attract new customers into their service territories in an
effort to keep energy rates low for all.  Although electric service in
Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota is regulated, IPL and WPL still face competition
from self-generation by large industrial customers, alternative energy sources,
and petitions to municipalize (Iowa) as well as service territory expansions by
municipal utilities through annexations (Wisconsin).  Refer to “Other
Matters - Other Future Considerations - Electric Sales Projections - Customer
Owned Generation” in MDA for information on the recent construction of
cogeneration facilities by two of IPL’s industrial customers.

In
November 2009, WPL filed a request with the PSCW for approval of a proposed
economic development program to attract and retain industrial customers in WPL’s
service territory.  If approved, the proposed program would permit WPL
to provide eligible industrial customers a discounted energy rate based upon
specifically-defined conditions.  To be eligible for the proposed
program, each customer would need to demonstrate that they were also eligible
for direct governmental assistance through a local, state or federal economic
development program, in addition to other criteria.  The discount
amounts would be limited to ensure recovery of marginal costs and would be
continually decreased until a customer was paying the full tariff
rate.  WPL currently anticipates receiving a decision from the PSCW
regarding this filing in the first half of 2010.

Renewable
Energy Standards

Iowa -

Electric utilities in Iowa are required to purchase or own their
proportionate share of 105 MW of capacity and associated energy from alternate
energy or small hydro facilities located in the utilities’ service
area.  IPL’s proportionate share is approximately 50 MW.  As
of Dec. 31, 2009, IPL had met the requirements of this renewable energy
standard.

Wisconsin
- -

A Wisconsin Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) was established in 2006
that requires electric utilities in Wisconsin, including WPL, to increase the
portion of their total Wisconsin retail electric sales supplied by renewable
energy sources above a benchmark of average retail sales from renewables in
2001, 2002 and 2003.  The RPS requires a 2% increase above the
benchmark by 2010 and a 6% increase above the benchmark by
2015.  Based on this RPS, WPL is required to supply a minimum of 6%
and 10% of its total Wisconsin retail electric sales with renewable energy
sources by 2010 and 2015, respectively.  Wisconsin utilities may reach
the RPS with renewable energy generated by the utility, acquired under purchased
power agreements (PPAs), or through the use of renewable resource
credits.

Minnesota
- -

A Minnesota Renewable Energy Standard (RES) was established in 2007
that requires electric utilities operating in Minnesota, including IPL, to
supply a minimum level of their total Minnesota retail electric sales with
renewable energy sources by certain future dates.  Based on this RES,
IPL’s total Minnesota retail electric sales supplied with renewable energy
sources must be at least 12% by 2012; 17% by 2016; 20% by 2020; and 25% by
2025.  Utilities in Minnesota may meet the requirements of the RES
with renewable energy generated by the utility, renewable energy acquired under
PPAs or the use of renewable resource credits.

Refer to
“Strategic Overview - Utility Generation Plans” in MDA for discussion of Alliant
Energy’s utility generation plan, which includes additional supply from wind
generation that is expected to contribute towards meeting renewable energy
requirements discussed above.

Energy
Conservation

-

With increased emphasis on energy conservation as a matter of public
policy, IPL and WPL are continuing and, where appropriate, expanding initiatives
to promote energy conservation and enhance customers’ ability to manage their
energy use more efficiently.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Energy
Efficiency Programs” in MDA for discussion of current energy efficiency programs
at IPL and WPL.


Electric
Supply

- -

Alliant Energy has met historical customer demand of electricity and
expects to continue meeting future demand through internally generated electric
supply, electric supply from long-term PPAs and additional electric supply
purchases from wholesale energy markets.  Alliant Energy’s mix of
electric supply experienced changes in 2009 with WPL’s purchase of the Neenah
Energy Facility and the completion of IPL’s Whispering Willow - East wind
project.  Alliant Energy expects its mix of electric supply to change
further in the next few years with plans for the construction of additional wind
generating facilities and the purchase of Riverside in Beloit,
Wisconsin.  IPL and WPL are currently updating their generation plans
to identify longer term generation needs for both utilities.  These
long-term generation plans are intended to meet customer demand, reduce reliance
on PPAs and mitigate the impacts of future plant retirements while maintaining
compliance with long-term electric demand planning reserve margins established
by regulators.  Alliant Energy currently expects to meet utility
customer demands in the future.  However, unanticipated regional or
local reliability issues could still arise in the event of unexpected delays in
the construction of new generating and/or transmission facilities, retirement of
generating facilities, generating facility outages, transmission system outages
or extended periods of extreme weather conditions.  Refer to the
“Electric Operating Information” tables for a profile of the sources of electric
supply used to meet customer demand for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL from 2005 to
2009.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Utility Generation Plans” in MDA
for details of Alliant Energy’s future utility generation plan.

Electric
Demand Planning Reserve Margin (PRM)

- IPL and WPL are required to
maintain a PRM above their projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure
reliability of electric service to their customers.  WPL is required
to maintain a 14.5% PRM for long-term planning (planning years two through 10)
and a PRM established by MISO for short-term planning.  PRM
requirements for IPL follow MISO’s reserve requirements.  IPL and WPL
currently have adequate capacity to meet the MISO PRM requirements.

Generation
- -

IPL and WPL own a portfolio of electric generating facilities located
in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including coal,
natural gas and renewable resources.  Refer to Item 2. Properties for
details of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating stations.

Generating
Capacity

- The generating capacity of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating
facilities is based upon MISO’s resource adequacy process, which uses the
unforced capacity of the generating facilities.  The generating
capacity for the June 2009 to May 2010 planning period by fuel type in MWs was
as follows:

Coal

-

Coal is the primary fuel source for Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s internally
generated electric supply and generally represents approximately 50% of their
total sources of electric energy.  Alliant Energy, through Corporate
Services as agent for IPL and WPL, has entered into contracts with different
suppliers to help ensure that a specified supply of coal is available at known
prices for IPL’s and WPL’s coal-fired generating facilities for 2010 through
2012.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, existing contracts provide for a portfolio
of coal supplies that cover approximately 91%, 62%, and 6% of Alliant Energy’s
estimated coal supply needs for 2010, 2011 and 2012,
respectively.  Alliant Energy believes this portfolio of coal supplies
represents a reasonable balance between the risks of insufficient supplies and
those associated with being unable to respond to future coal market
changes.  Alliant Energy expects to meet remaining coal requirements
from either future contracts or purchases in the spot market.  Alliant
Energy, through its subsidiaries Corporate Services, IPL and WPL, also enters
into various coal transportation contracts to meet its coal supply
agreements.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, existing coal transportation
agreements cover approximately 80%, 67%, 67%, 47%, and 47% of Alliant Energy’s
estimated coal transportation needs for 2010 through 2014,
respectively.

The
majority of the coal utilized by IPL and WPL is from the Wyoming Powder River
Basin.  A majority of this coal is transported by rail-car directly
from Wyoming to IPL’s and WPL’s generating stations, with the remainder
transported from Wyoming to the Mississippi River by rail-car and then via
barges to the final destination.  As protection against interruptions
in coal deliveries, IPL and WPL strive to maintain average coal inventory supply
targets of 25 to 50 days for generating stations with year-round deliveries and
30 to 150 days (depending upon the time of year) for generating stations with
seasonal deliveries.  Actual inventory averages for 2009 were 82 days
for generating stations with year-round deliveries and 210 days for generating
stations with seasonal deliveries.  The average days on hand were
computed based on actual tons of inventory divided by average daily tons burned
in 2009.  Average days on hand increased in 2009 primarily due to
lower coal volumes burned as a result of reduced generation needed to serve the
lower sales volumes in 2009.  Alliant Energy periodically tests coal
from sources other than the Wyoming Powder River Basin to determine which
alternative sources of coal are most compatible with its generating
stations.  Access to alternative sources of coal is expected to
provide Alliant Energy with further protection against interruptions and lessen
its dependence on its primary coal source.

Average
delivered fossil fuel costs are expected to increase in the future due to price
structures and adjustment provisions in existing coal contracts, rate structures
and adjustment provisions in existing transportation contracts, fuel-related
surcharges incorporated by transportation carriers and recent coal and
transportation market trends.  Existing coal commodity contracts with
terms of greater than one year have fixed future year prices that generally
reflect recent market trends.  A few of Alliant Energy’s existing coal
contracts have provisions for price adjustments should specific indices
change.  Rate adjustment provisions in older transportation contracts
are primarily based on changes in the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor as published
by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.  Rate adjustment provisions
in more recent transportation contracts are based on changes in the All
Inclusive Index Less Fuel as published by the Association of American
Railroads.  These more recent transportation contracts also contain
fuel surcharges that are subject to change monthly based on changes in diesel
fuel prices.  Other factors that may impact coal prices for future
commitments are increasing costs for supplier mineral rights, increasing costs
to mine the coal and changes in various associated laws and
regulations.  For example, emission restrictions related to sulfur
dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and mercury, along with other environmental
limitations on generating stations, continue to increase and will likely limit
the ability to obtain, and further increase the cost of, adequate coal
supplies.  Factors that may impact future transportation rates
include, but are not limited to: the need for railroads to enhance/expand
infrastructure for demand growth, corresponding investments in locomotives and
the desire to improve margins on coal movements commensurate with margins on
non-coal movements.

Given its
current coal procurement process, the specific coal market in its primary
purchase region and regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms, Alliant Energy believes
it is reasonably insulated against coal price volatility. Alliant Energy’s coal
procurement process stresses periodic purchases, staggering of contract terms,
stair-stepped levels of supply going forward for multiple years and supplier
diversity. Similarly, given the term lengths of its transportation agreements,
Alliant Energy believes it is reasonably insulated against future higher coal
transportation rates from the major railroads.

Natural
Gas

- Alliant Energy owns several natural gas-fired generating facilities
including IPL’s 565 MW Emery Generating Station, WPL’s 300 MW Neenah Energy
Facility and Resources’ 300 MW Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility.  WPL
has exclusive rights to the output of the Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility under
an affiliated lease agreement.  These facilities help meet customer
demand for electricity generally during peak hour demands.  Internally
generated electric supply from natural gas-fired generating facilities generally
represent less than 5% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of
electric energy.  Refer to Note 1(e) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on WPL’s purchase
of the Neenah Energy Facility from Resources in June 2009.


Alliant
Energy has responsibility to supply natural gas to the generating facilities it
owns as well as Riverside, which WPL has rights to under a PPA.  WPL
has contracts with several companies to provide fixed-price natural gas supply
for these generating facilities with the longest contracts having terms through
August 2010.  WPL has also contracted with ANR Pipeline to provide
firm pipeline transportation of 60,000 dekatherms (Dths) per day for Riverside
and 2 million Dths of storage capacity for WPL’s natural gas-fired generating
facilities.  IPL has also contracted with Northern Border Pipeline to
provide firm pipeline transportation of 50,000 Dths per day for the Emery
Generating Station through March 2010.

Nuclear

-

In January 2006, IPL sold its interest in the Duane Arnold Energy Center
(DAEC) to a subsidiary of FPL Group, Inc. (FPL) and upon closing of the sale
entered into a PPA with FPL to purchase energy and capacity from DAEC through
February 2014.  In July 2005, WPL sold its interest in the Kewaunee
Nuclear Power Plant (Kewaunee) to a subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc.
(Dominion) and upon closing of the sale entered into a long-term PPA with
Dominion to purchase energy and capacity from Kewaunee through December
2013.  As a result of these transactions, Alliant Energy no longer has
an ownership interest in any nuclear generating facilities.  Alliant
Energy entered into these transactions to reduce the financial and operational
uncertainty associated with nuclear generating facility ownership and operations
while still retaining the benefit of the output from such nuclear generating
facilities.

Wind

- - IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind project in Franklin County, Iowa
began commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2009.  WPL’s 68 MW
Cedar Ridge wind project in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin began commercial
operation in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Whispering Willow - East and
Cedar Ridge are the first fully owned and operated wind projects for IPL and
WPL, respectively.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Utility Generation
Plans” in MDA for discussion of additional wind projects included in the Utility
Generation Plans.

Purchased
Power -

IPL and WPL enter into PPAs and purchase electricity from
wholesale energy markets to meet a portion of their customer demand for
electricity.  Purchased power represented almost 50% of Alliant
Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy in
2009.  IPL’s most significant PPA is with FPL for the purchase of
energy and capacity from DAEC through February 2014.  WPL’s most
significant PPAs are with Dominion for the purchase of energy and capacity from
Kewaunee through December 2013 and with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation for
the purchase of energy and capacity from Riverside through May
2013.

Refer to
Note 1(h) for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s rate recovery of electric production
fuel and purchased energy costs, Note 3(a) for details regarding PPAs accounted
for as operating leases and Note 12(b) for details on IPL’s and WPL’s coal,
natural gas and other purchased power commitments in Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Electric
Transmission

-

IPL

- - IPL completed the sale of its electric transmission assets located in Iowa,
Minnesota and Illinois to ITC in 2007.  IPL sold its electric
transmission assets in order to monetize the value of the assets to help fund
future capital expenditures, to capture tax benefits under federal tax policy
that allows deferral of gains on sales of qualifying electric transmission
assets completed prior to Jan. 1, 2008 (based on regulations at the time of the
sale) and to promote regional transmission expansion that is expected to improve
transmission reliability and access for its customers in Iowa and
Minnesota.  ITC is an independent for-profit, transmission-only
company and is a transmission-owning member of the MISO RTO, Midwest Reliability
Organization and Reliability First Corporation Regional Entities.  ITC
has transmission interconnections at various locations with other transmission
owning utilities in the Midwest.  These interconnections enhance the
overall reliability of the IPL delivery system and provide access to multiple
sources of economic and emergency energy.  IPL currently receives
substantially all its transmission services from ITC.  The annual
transmission service rates that ITC charge its customers is calculated each
calendar year using a FERC-approved cost of service formula rate template
referred to as Attachment O.  Refer to “Other Matters - Other Future
Considerations - IPL’s Electric Transmission Service Charges” in MDA for
additional information regarding transmission services charges from ITC
including a FERC 206 complaint filed by IPL against ITC in 2008.


WPL

- - WPL transferred its transmission assets to ATC in 2001 in exchange for an
ownership interest in ATC.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, WPL held a 16%
ownership interest in ATC with a carrying value of $219 million.  WPL
currently anticipates making capital contributions of $3 million, $4 million and
$3 million to ATC in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, to maintain its current
ownership percentage.  During 2009, ATC distributed to WPL, in the
form of dividends, $29 million or approximately 80% of WPL’s equity earnings
from ATC.  Although no assurance can be given, WPL anticipates ATC
will continue this dividend payout ratio in the future.  ATC is an
independent for-profit, transmission-only company and is a transmission-owning
member of the MISO RTO, Midwest Reliability Organization and Reliability First
Corporation Regional Entities.  ATC has transmission interconnections
with various other transmission owning utilities in the
Midwest.  These interconnections enhance the overall reliability of
the WPL delivery system and provide access to multiple sources of economic and
emergency energy.  WPL currently receives substantially all its
transmission services from ATC.  Refer to Note 20 of Alliant Energy’s
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for details of agreements between
ATC and WPL.

MISO
Markets

- IPL and WPL are members of MISO, a FERC-approved RTO, which is
responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the transmission system
in their service territories.  IPL and WPL participate in the
wholesale energy market and ancillary services markets operated by MISO, which
are discussed in more detail below.

Wholesale
Energy Market -

IPL and WPL began participation in the wholesale energy
market operated by MISO in 2005.  The market impacts the way IPL and
WPL buy and sell wholesale electricity, obtain transmission services, schedule
generation and ensure resource adequacy to reliably serve load.  In
the market, IPL and WPL submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for
energy at locations across the MISO region.  MISO evaluates IPL’s,
WPL’s and other market participants’ energy injections into, and withdrawals
from, the system to economically dispatch the entire MISO system on an hourly
basis.  MISO settles these hourly offers and bids based on locational
marginal prices, which are market-driven values based on the specific time and
location of the purchase and/or sale of energy.  The market is
intended to send price signals to stakeholders where generation or transmission
system expansion is needed.  This market-based approach is expected to
result in lower overall costs in areas with abundant transmission
capacity.  In addition, MISO may dispatch generators that support
reliability needs, but which would not have operated based on economic
needs.  In these cases, MISO’s settlement assures that these
generators are made whole financially for variable costs.

Financial
Transmission Rights (FTRs) and Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs)

- In areas
of constrained transmission capacity, such as Wisconsin, costs could be higher
due to congestion and its impact on locational marginal prices.  As
part of the MISO market restructuring in 2005, physical transmission rights of
IPL and WPL were replaced with FTRs.  FTRs provide a hedge for
congestion costs that occur in the MISO day-ahead energy market.  Both
IPL and WPL are allocated ARRs from MISO each year based on historical use of
the transmission system.  The revenues from these ARRs are used by IPL
and WPL to acquire FTRs through the FTR auctions operated by
MISO.  IPL’s and WPL’s current FTRs acquired from ARRs extend through
May 31, 2010.  MISO re-allocates ARRs annually based on a fiscal year
from June 1 through May 31.  Based on the FTRs awarded to IPL and WPL
to-date and future expected allocations of ARRs, along with the expected
regulatory recovery treatment of MISO costs, the financial impacts associated
with FTRs have not differed significantly from the financial impacts associated
with physical transmission rights that existed prior to the MISO wholesale
energy market.

Ancillary
Services Market

- In January 2009, MISO launched an ancillary services
market, which integrates the procurement and use of regulation and contingency
reserves with the existing wholesale energy market implemented in
2005.  Regulation refers to the moment-to-moment changes in generation
that are necessary to meet changes in electricity demand.  Contingency
reserves refer to additional generation or demand response resources, either
on-line or that can be brought on-line within 10 minutes, to meet certain major
events such as the loss of a large generating unit or transmission
line.  MISO plans to address in 2011 refinements to its ancillary
services market requested by market participants.

MISO
Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) Settlements -

In 2008, FERC issued
two orders requiring MISO to resettle two separate amounts of historical RSG
charges from its wholesale energy market.  These resettlements involve
MISO collecting RSG charges from some market participants and refunding the
collected amounts to other market participants.  In May and June 2009,
FERC issued two orders reversing portions of its 2008 orders that reduced the
amount of anticipated RSG resettlements compared to initial
estimates.  Various FERC orders related to RSG settlements and
resettlements are subject to FERC rehearing or have been appealed to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  In 2009, IPL and WPL received
$2 million and $1 million, respectively, of net benefits from the two
resettlements, including interest.


MISO
and PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) Market Flow Corrections

- In August
2009, MISO and PJM disclosed an error in the calculation of market flow data
between the two independent system operators that began in 2005.  The
error resulted in incorrect payments between MISO and PJM during 2005 through
2009.  Because IPL and WPL participated in both the MISO and PJM
markets during the period of the error, IPL and WPL may be entitled to refunds
or may be required to make additional payments to the two independent system
operators.  MISO and PJM are currently in settlement discussions
regarding this matter.  IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict
the ultimate resolution of this matter.  However, the net impact of
payments to or refunds from these two independent system operations to resolve
this matter is not expected to have a material adverse impact on IPL’s or WPL’s
financial condition and results of operation.

Electric
Environmental Matters

-

Alliant Energy is subject to environmental regulations issued by federal,
state and local agencies.  Such regulations are the result of a number
of environmental laws passed by the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and local
governments and enforced by federal, state and local regulatory
agencies.  The laws impacting Alliant Energy’s electric operations
include, but are not limited to, the Safe Drinking Water Act; Clean Water Act;
Clean Air Act (CAA); National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; Toxic Substances
Control Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act and Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-Know Act of 1986; Endangered Species Act; Occupational Safety and
Health Act; National Energy Policy Act, as amended; Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act; Hazardous Materials Transportation Act; Pollution
Prevention Act; and Department of Homeland Security Appropriations
Act.  Alliant Energy regularly obtains federal, state and local
permits to assure compliance with environmental protection laws and
regulations.  Costs associated with such compliance have increased in
recent years and are expected to continue to increase in the
future.  Alliant Energy anticipates these prudently incurred costs for
IPL and WPL will be recoverable through future rate case
proceedings.  Refer to “Environmental Matters” and “Legislative
Matters” in MDA and Note 12(e) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for further discussion of electric environmental matters
including current or proposed environmental regulations under the Clean Air
Interstate Rule, Clean Air Visibility Rule, Utility Maximum Available Control
Technology (MACT) Rule, Wisconsin State Mercury Rule, Wisconsin Reasonably
Available Control Technology Rule, Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) Rule, Fine Particle NAAQS Rule, Nitrogen Dioxide NAAQS Rule, SO2 NAAQS
Rule, Industrial Boiler and Process Heater MACT Rule, Federal Clean Water Act
including Section 316(b), Wisconsin State Thermal Rule, Coal Combustion
By-products and various legislation and EPA regulations to monitor and regulate
the emission of GHG including the EPA Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule, GHG
Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Finding and GHG Tailoring
Rule.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Environmental Compliance Plans”
in MDA for details of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s future environmental
compliance plans to adhere to environmental regulations.





2)  GAS UTILITY

OPERATIONS

General

- -

Gas utility operations represent the second largest operating segment
for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.  Alliant Energy’s gas utility
operations are located in the Midwest with IPL and WPL providing gas service in
Iowa, southern and central Wisconsin and southern Minnesota.  Refer to
the “Gas Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding gas
utility operations.

In
addition to sales of natural gas to retail customers, IPL and WPL provide
transportation service to commercial and industrial customers by moving
customer-owned gas through Alliant Energy’s distribution systems to the
customers’ meters.  Revenues are collected for this service pursuant
to transportation tariffs.

Seasonality

-

Gas sales follow a seasonal pattern with an annual base-load of gas and a
large heating peak occurring during the winter season.  Natural gas
obtained from producers, marketers and brokers, as well as gas in storage, is
utilized to meet the peak heating season requirements.  Storage
contracts allow IPL and WPL to purchase gas in the summer, store the gas in
underground storage fields and deliver it in the winter.

Competition

- - Federal and state regulatory policies are in place to bring more competition
to the gas industry.  While the gas utility distribution function is
expected to remain a regulated function, sales of the natural gas commodity and
related services are subject to competition from third parties.  It
remains uncertain if, and when, the current economic disincentives for smaller
consumption customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be
removed such that the utility business begins to face competition for the sale
of gas to those customers.

Gas
Supply

- IPL and WPL maintain purchase agreements with over 40 suppliers
of natural gas from various gas producing regions of the U.S. and
Canada.  The majority of the gas supply contracts are for terms of six
months or less, with the remaining supply contracts having terms through March
2011.  IPL’s and WPL’s gas supply commitments are primarily
market-based.


In
providing gas commodity service to retail customers, Corporate Services
administers a diversified portfolio of transportation and storage contracts on
behalf of IPL and WPL.  Transportation contracts with Northern Natural
Gas Company (NNG), ANR Pipeline (ANR), Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
(NGPL), Northern Border Pipeline (NBPL) and Guardian Pipeline (Guardian) allow
access to gas supplies located in the U.S. and Canada.  Arrangements
with Firm Citygate Supplies (FCS) provide IPL with gas delivered directly to its
service territory.  In 2009, the maximum daily delivery capacity for
IPL and WPL was as follows (in Dths):

FERC
Investigation of Pipeline Tariffs

- In November 2009, FERC initiated
proceedings to investigate the rates of return that NNG, Great Lakes Pipeline
and NGPL earned in 2008.  FERC used data from annual filings made by
interstate pipelines to estimate the rate of return that all U.S. pipelines
earned in 2008 and concluded that these three pipelines may have earned rates of
return exceeding 20%.  The purpose of the proceeding is to determine
whether the tariff rates charged by these pipelines are set too
high.  By law, there will be no retroactive refunds as a result of
these proceedings.  However, the proceedings may result in changes to
tariff rates charged by these pipelines in the future.  Any change in
tariff rates charged by these pipelines in the future is expected to be passed
on to IPL’s and WPL’s gas customers through their respective natural gas cost
recovery mechanisms.  FERC anticipates issuing a ruling regarding
these proceedings in late 2010.

Refer to
Note 1(h) for information relating to utility natural gas cost recovery
mechanisms and Note 12(b) for discussion of natural gas commitments in Alliant
Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Gas
Environmental Matters

-

Alliant Energy is subject to environmental regulations by federal, state
and local agencies.  Such regulations are the result of a number of
environmental laws passed by the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and local
governments and enforced by federal, state and local regulatory
agencies.  The laws impacting Alliant Energy’s gas operations include,
but are not limited to, the Safe Drinking Water Act; Clean Water Act; National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969; Toxic Substances Control Act; Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments

Act.  Alliant Energy regularly obtains federal, state and local
permits to assure compliance with environmental protection laws and
regulations.  Costs associated with such compliance have increased in
recent years and are expected to continue to increase in the
future.  Alliant Energy anticipates these prudently incurred costs for
IPL and WPL will be recoverable through future rate case
proceedings.  Refer to Note 12(e) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of gas environmental
matters.




3)  STEAM

UTILITY OPERATIONS -

IPL has
historically provided steam service to approximately 200 customers in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, who used high-pressure steam for production purposes or
low-pressure steam for hot water and heat.  Substantially all of the
steam for these customers was generated by IPL’s Prairie Creek and Sixth Street
Generating Stations in Cedar Rapids prior to June 2008.  In June 2008,
IPL’s Prairie Creek and Sixth Street Generating Stations were shutdown as a
result of significant damage caused by severe flooding in downtown Cedar
Rapids.  Soon after the flood waters receded, IPL made necessary
repairs to its steam distribution systems and established temporary steam
generating systems (natural gas-fired package boilers and water treatment
systems) to resume steam service for its customers.  Following months
of evaluations and discussions with its steam customers, IPL announced in the
second quarter of 2009 its decision to discontinue providing temporary steam
service to those steam customers located in downtown Cedar Rapids previously
served by IPL’s Sixth Street Generating Station.  IPL ceased
low-pressure steam operations in downtown Cedar Rapids in December 2009 and
currently expects to cease high-pressure steam operations in downtown Cedar
Rapids in the second quarter of 2010.  The Prairie Creek Generating
Station was returned to service in 2009 and is expected to be the primary source
of steam for IPL’s remaining high-pressure steam customers in the
future.

D.  INFORMATION
RELATING TO

NON-REGULATED

OPERATIONS

Resources

manages a portfolio of wholly-owned subsidiaries and additional investments
through several distinct platforms: RMT (including WindConnect®), Non-regulated
Generation, Transportation and other non-regulated investments.

RMT -

provides renewable energy services and environmental consulting and
engineering services to industrial and commercial clients
nationwide.  RMT offers renewable energy services through its
WindConnect® segment, which provides siting, design, construction, and high
voltage connection services for wind and solar projects in the
U.S.  RMT’s environmental consulting and engineering services include
site remediation and restoration, air quality control, auditing/compliance
management, facility siting and planning, and environmental
construction.

The
economic conditions during 2008 and 2009 have resulted in constrained financial
markets and lower funding for large capital projects in the renewable energy
services market.  With fewer renewable energy projects receiving
funding, the competition for those projects has intensified.  RMT is
currently among a small group of companies that has technical expertise and
project experience for all phases of a renewable energy project, from siting
through electrical grid connection.  Future growth in the renewable
energy infrastructure market may attract new competitors to the renewable energy
services market including large construction companies.

The
environmental consulting and engineering market is mature, highly fragmented,
and composed of a large number of firms ranging in size from small private
entities to large public firms.  RMT’s competitors in this market vary
by their scope of services, scale and geographical location of
projects.

Non-regulated
Generation -

owns the 300 MW, simple-cycle, natural gas-fired Sheboygan
Falls Energy Facility near Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, which is leased to WPL
for an initial period of 20 years ending in 2025.  Also included in
Non-regulated Generation is Industrial Energy Applications, Inc., which provides
on-site energy services with small standby generators.

Transportation
- -

includes a short-line railway that provides freight service between
Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; a barge terminal and hauling services on
the Mississippi River; and other transfer and storage services.

Other
non-regulated investments -

include the Whiting Petroleum Corporation tax
sharing agreement receivable discussed in Note 4(b) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements,” real estate investments, two corporate
airplanes and several other modest investments.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

You
should carefully consider each of the risks described below relating to Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL, together with all of the other information contained in
this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision
with respect to our securities.  If any of the following risks develop
into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your
investment.


Risks
related to the regulation of our business could impact the rates we are able to
charge, our costs and our profitability -

We are subject to comprehensive
regulation by federal and state regulatory authorities, which significantly
influences our operating environment, the ability to timely recover costs from
customers and to earn appropriate rates of return.  In particular, our
utility operations are regulated by regulatory authorities with jurisdiction
over public utilities, including the IUB, the PSCW, the MPUC and
FERC.  These authorities regulate many aspects of our operations,
including: rates charged to customers; costs of fuel, purchased power and
natural gas that can be recovered from customers; operating costs that can be
recovered from customers; the authorized rates of return on capital; common
equity levels; the amount of deferred costs that may be recovered from
customers; our ability to site and construct new generating facilities and the
amount of costs associated therewith that may be recovered from customers;
authorization to install environmental pollution control equipment and whether
equipment costs can be recovered from customers; construction and maintenance of
facilities; operations, including requiring certain sources of energy such as
renewable sources and reductions in energy usage by customers; rates paid to
transmission operators; safety; issuance of securities; accounting matters; and
transactions between affiliates.  Further, provisions of the Wisconsin
Utility Holding Company Act limit our ability to invest in non-utility
activities and could deter takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our
common stock that would be willing to pay a premium for our common
stock.  These regulatory authorities are also empowered to impose
financial penalties and other sanctions on us if we are found to have violated
statutes and regulations governing utility operations.  Our ability to
obtain rate adjustments to earn appropriate rates of return depends upon timely
regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and we cannot
assure that rate adjustments will be obtained or appropriate rates of return on
capital will be earned.  IPL and WPL currently plan to file a number
of rate cases with regulatory authorities.  In future rate cases, IPL
and WPL may not receive an adequate amount of rate relief, rates may be reduced,
rate adjustments may not be approved on a timely basis, costs may not be
otherwise recovered through rates, and allowed rates of return on capital may be
inadequate.  As a result, we may experience adverse impacts on our
financial condition and results of operations.  We are unable to
predict the impact on our business and operating results from future regulatory
activities of any of these agencies.  Changes in regulations or the
imposition of additional regulations may require us to incur additional costs or
change business operations or our business plan, which may have an adverse
impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

We are
exposed to risks related to economic conditions -

Our utility operations
are impacted by the economic conditions in our service
territories.  The current economic downturn in our service territories
has caused our sales and revenues to decline.  The totality of the
sales declines to date is not fully reflected in all our rates, causing an
adverse impact on our financial condition and results of
operations.  If economic conditions decline further in our service
territories, we may experience additional reduced demand for electricity or
natural gas.  If current and future demand declines are not reflected
in our rates, our financial condition and results of operations could be
negatively impacted.  In addition, adverse economic conditions in our
service territories could negatively impact our collections of
receivables.  The current economic downturn in our service territories
has also caused a reduction in the number of industrial customers in our service
territories.  We have fewer customers as a result of the most recent
recession and could lose additional customers due to economic conditions,
customers constructing their own generation facilities, and loss of service
territory or franchises.  The current economic climate, and future
economic growth, may not cause enough growth for us to replace the lost energy
demand from these customers.  The loss of customers, and the inability
to replace those customers with new customers, could negatively impact our
financial condition and results of operations.

Changes
in commodity prices or the availability of commodities may increase the cost of
producing electric energy or change the amount we receive from selling electric
energy, harming our financial performance -

The prices that we may obtain
for electric energy may not compensate for changes in delivered coal, natural
gas or electric energy spot-market costs, or changes in the relationship between
such costs and the market prices of electric energy.  As a result, we
may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers, especially at
WPL where we do not have a retail automatic fuel cost adjustment clause, which
allows more consistent and timely cost recovery.  This may result in
an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.  We are heavily exposed to changes in the price and
availability of coal because the majority of the electricity generated by us is
from our coal-fired generating

facilities.  We
have contracts of varying durations for the supply and transportation of coal
for most of our existing generating capability, but as these contracts end or
otherwise are not honored, we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as
favorable as the current contracts.  Further, we currently rely on
coal primarily from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and any disruption of coal
production in, or transportation from, that region may cause us to incur
additional costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.  We also have responsibility to supply natural gas to
certain natural gas-fired electric generating facilities that we own and lease,
which increase our exposure to the more volatile market prices of natural
gas.  We have natural gas supply contracts in place which are
generally short-term in duration.  The natural gas supply commitments
are either fixed price in nature or market-based.  As some of the
contracts are market-based, and all of the contracts are short-term, we may not
be able to purchase natural gas on terms as favorable as the current contracts
when the current contracts expire.  Further, any disruption of
production or transportation of natural gas may cause us to incur additional
costs to purchase natural gas that may adversely impact our financial condition
and results of operations.  We buy electricity from the market, and
sell our generation into the market.  The market prices impact the
volumes of electricity bought and sold and impact our results of
operations.  The derivative instruments we use to manage our commodity
risks have terms allowing our counterparties to demand cash
collateral.  Extensive cash collateral demands could adversely impact
our cash flows.


Risks
related to implementing our strategic plan -

Our strategic plan includes
investments in renewable energy and natural gas generation, environmental
control equipment at existing generating facilities, Smart Grid enablement
through automated metering infrastructure and energy efficiency.  The
construction or purchase of renewable energy generating facilities and advanced
metering infrastructure is subject to many risks, which may cause increased
costs or inability to recover costs, or may impede or block our ability to
achieve our strategic objectives.  The state utility commissions may
not permit us to site, construct or purchase the generating facilities or add
large-scale environmental control equipment to existing generating
facilities.  Such a state utility commission decision could be based
upon any number of factors, including the commission’s determination that there
is no need for the facilities or equipment, customer rate increases associated
with the new generating facilities or equipment are too large or that the added
costs to the customer outweigh the benefits to the customer, technology changes,
environmental concerns or other factors.  State utility commissions
could approve the construction or purchase of generating facilities, but include
conditions that make the project uneconomical.  Such conditions could
include low rates of return, inability to adequately recover costs or certain
operating restrictions.  If we receive regulatory approval to build
the facilities, advocacy groups or other associations may file lawsuits seeking
to overturn or modify the regulatory approvals, as has been done relative to
WPL’s Bent Tree - Phase I wind project.  If the state utility
commissions do not approve the new generating facilities or do not approve
conditions that make the project economical, or if certain groups successfully
challenge the state utility commissions’ decisions to allow the generating
facilities, we will not be able to implement our strategic plan and our
financial condition and ability to serve our customers could be negatively
affected.

Risks
related to wind generation -

Our strategic plan includes our utility
subsidiaries building and operating wind generating facilities.  Our
subsidiary, RMT, Inc., is also dependent on growth in the wind development
market.  The health of, and growth of, the wind market depends on tax
incentives, such as the production tax credit, and other incentives included in
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and other laws and
regulations.  It also depends on the state of the economy and credit
markets.  The failure of tax incentives to work as expected, the
elimination of or changes to these incentives, or continued economic and credit
market weakness, could adversely impact our ability to achieve our strategic
plan and could adversely impact our financial condition and results of
operations.  Growth at RMT requires RMT to maintain its current market
share in the wind construction market as the market grows.  RMT’s
inability to maintain its market share could adversely impact our ability to
achieve our strategic plan and could adversely impact our results of
operations.

Risks
related to large construction projects -

Large construction projects,
such as the building of renewable energy generating facilities, adding
large-scale environmental control equipment to generating facilities or adding
new infrastructure such as advanced metering infrastructure, are subject to
various risks that could cause costs to increase or delays in
completion.  These risks include shortages of, the inability to
obtain, the cost of and the consistency of labor, materials and equipment, the
inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their
contracts, the inability to agree to terms of contracts or disputes in contract
terms, work stoppages, adverse weather conditions, the inability to obtain
necessary permits in a timely manner, changes in applicable laws or regulations,
adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, governmental
actions, legal action, and unforeseen engineering or technology
issues.  If the construction project is over budget, we may not be
able to recover those excess costs.  Inability to recover excess
costs, or inability to complete the project in a timely manner, could adversely
impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Costs
of compliance with existing and future laws and the incurrence of liabilities,
particularly related to the environment, could adversely affect our
profitability -

Our operations are subject to extensive regulation
including environmental protection laws and regulations relating to, among other
things, water discharges, management of hazardous and solid waste, and air
emissions such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and
mercury.  Laws and regulations affecting our operations have recently
been adopted by the EPA and state authorities, and are being implemented in the
states we operate.  In addition, new regulations from federal and
state authorities, such as potential water, greenhouse gas (GHG) and coal ash
regulations, are under consideration and may be adopted, requiring modifications
to our utility operations.  New interpretations of existing laws and
regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our
facilities.  Rules may be adopted and then overturned by courts, such
as the Clean Air Mercury Rule, or sent back to the EPA for revisions, such as
the Clean Air Interstate Rule.  These regulations, possible new
regulations and possible new interpretations may substantially increase
compliance expenditures made by us or restrict our operations in the
future.  We also have current or previous ownership interests in sites
associated with the production of gas and the production and delivery of
electricity for which we may be liable for additional costs related to
investigation, remediation and monitoring of these sites.  We cannot
predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures
(including the potential or magnitude of any fines or penalties, including the
severity of any restrictions on our operations) related to environmental
matters, although we expect them to be material.  Further, we believe
we comply with such regulations, but a state or federal oversight agency may not
agree, as occurred when the EPA issued a notice of violation to WPL alleging
non-compliance with various permitting requirements under the Clean Air
Act.  The risks associated with compliance and estimating compliance
costs include the possibility that changes will be made to the current
environmental laws and regulations, the uncertainty regarding the type of
compliance that will finally be required by rules and regulations, the
possibility that a state or federal oversight agency will not agree that we are
compliant, the uncertain treatment of expenditures by regulators in setting our
rates, the possible inability to obtain necessary materials or skilled labor
force required for certain equipment necessary to comply with environmental
regulations, the rising costs of equipment, services and labor related to
environmental compliance, the possibility that technology will not perform as
anticipated, co-owner considerations with respect to our jointly-owned
facilities, and the uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental
laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible
parties.  Compliance with current and future environmental laws and
regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs,
including remediation and containment expenses and monitoring obligations, which
could adversely impact our financial condition and results of
operations.


We plan
to move forward with environmental control projects that were planned to comply
with the Clean Air Interstate Rule because we expect future environmental
regulations will be adopted that require these projects.  We also
purchased emission allowances to comply with the Clean Air Interstate
Rule.  State utility commissions may not approve such projects because
the current requirements for them are in question, or may not allow us to
recover costs of the projects and emission allowances if future regulations are
not adopted or changed significantly from current
regulations.  Co-owners in our jointly-owned facilities may not agree
with our decision to move forward with these projects.  Further, more
stringent environmental regulations could be adopted in the future, requiring
controls in addition to those currently planned.  Failure to obtain
utility commission approvals, inability to fully recover costs or failure to
obtain co-owner approval could adversely impact our financial condition and
results of operations.

Citizen
groups or others may bring litigation over environmental issues including claims
of various types, such as property damage and personal
injury.  Citizen legal challenges to compliance decisions on the
enforcement of environmental requirements, such as approval of air permits,
opacity and other air quality standards may be brought against
us.  WPL is currently involved in matters in which the Sierra Club is
alleging various violations of the Clean Air Act.  Specifically, the
Sierra Club alleged that WPL violated the Clean Air Act by not obtaining permits
for various projects at its owned and co-owned generating facilities, by
violating opacity limits at a generating facility, and by changing the permitted
operation of a generating facility.  If we are unsuccessful defending
such litigation, we could be subject to restrictions or prohibitions to
operating our generation facilities, costly upgrades to our generation
facilities, payment of damages or fines, and litigation costs, all of which
could be material.  An adverse result in such legal actions could have
a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of
operations.

Actions
related to global climate change and reducing GHG emissions could impact us
- -

The primary GHG emitted from our utility operations is carbon dioxide
(CO2) from combustion of fossil fuels at our generating
facilities.  Our generating facilities are primarily coal-fired
facilities.  Various laws and regulations addressing climate change
are being considered at the federal and state levels.  The Supreme
Court has ruled that CO2 may be regulated by the EPA.  The EPA has
determined that CO2 threatens the public health and welfare and may now regulate
all CO2 emissions under the Clean Air Act.  Several bills have been
introduced in the U.S. Congress that could compel CO2 emission
reductions.  Proposals under consideration include limitations on the
amount of GHG that can be emitted (so called “caps”) together with systems of
trading allowed emissions capacities.  Under most of these proposals,
companies like ours would be allocated a certain number of emission
allowances.  If our CO2 emissions were higher than the allowances
allocated to us, we would have to purchase additional, and potentially costly,
allowances to cover our current emissions.  Under some proposals, we
would not receive an adequate number of allowances to cover our current
emissions.  This type of system could require us to reduce emissions,
even though carbon capture technology is not currently available for efficient
reduction, or to purchase costly allowances for such
emissions.  Emissions also could be taxed independently of
limits.  In addition, we may be required to reduce our customers’ use
of electricity, thereby reducing our sales.  The Governors of all of
the states in our service territories have signed on to the Midwestern Governors
Association GHG Accord (GHG Accord).  The stated goal of the GHG
Accord’s platform is to “maximize the energy resources and economic advantages
and opportunities of Midwestern states while reducing emissions of atmospheric
CO2 and other GHG.”  Each state in our service territories has
established a board or commission regarding reducing CO2
emissions.  Wisconsin’s legislature is considering GHG emission
legislation.  We could be subject to any regulations that are adopted
in the future, and could become the target of challenges, because generating
electricity using fossil fuels emits CO2.  The impacts of such
proposals could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and
results of operations.


Furthermore, state
regulators may consider future climate change policy implications in proceedings
related to making environmental upgrades to existing
facilities.  Future regulation of CO2 emissions could make some of our
electric generating facilities uneconomic to maintain or operate.  The
cost to comply with future potential CO2 emissions regulations could be very
high.  There is no guarantee that we will be allowed to fully recover
compliance costs or that cost recovery will not be delayed or otherwise
conditioned.  Due to the uncertainty of what form CO2 emissions
regulations could take, control technologies available to reduce GHG emissions,
including CO2, and the unknown nature of potential compliance obligations should
climate change regulations be enacted, we cannot provide any assurance regarding
the potential impacts these future regulations would have on our
operations.  In addition, we cannot predict if, or how, state
regulators may factor this issue into approvals and permits for us to modify our
existing coal-fired generation.  All such regulatory results could
adversely impact our ability to implement our strategic plan and our financial
condition and results of operations.

Risks
related to capital markets -

We rely on accessing the capital markets to
support capital expenditure programs and other capital requirements, including
expenditures to build utility infrastructure and comply with future regulatory
requirements.  Successful implementation of our strategic plan and
other long-term business strategies is dependent upon the ability of us to
access the capital markets under competitive terms and rates.  We have
forecasted capital expenditures of $2.5 billion over the next three
years.  Capital markets, particularly debt markets, were under
considerable strain recently, resulting in negative impacts on the availability
and terms of credit available to certain businesses.  Any national
economic downturn or disruption of financial markets could reduce our access to
capital necessary for our operations and to execute our strategic
plan.  If the credit crisis returns, we may be unable to access the
credit markets, or our cost of borrowing might significantly
increase.  We rely on our strong credit ratings to access the credit
markets.  If our credit ratings are downgraded for any reason, we
could pay higher interest rates in future financings, the pool of potential
lenders could be reduced, borrowing costs under existing credit facilities could
increase, our access to the commercial paper market could be limited, or we
could be required to provide additional credit assurance, including cash
collateral, to contract counterparties.  If our access to capital were
to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly
due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory
constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, our
financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely
affected.

We are
subject to employee workforce factors that could affect our businesses -

We are subject to employee workforce factors, including loss or retirement of
key personnel, availability of and our ability to recruit qualified personnel,
collective bargaining agreements with employees and work stoppage that could
affect our businesses and financial condition and results of
operations.  Further, our workforce is dominated by members of the
baby boomer generation who are nearing retirement.  As a large portion
of our workforce prepares to retire, we must recruit and train new employees to
replace them.  Costs of recruitment and the ability to find qualified
employees are expected to become more difficult as our workforce
retires.  These factors could adversely affect our business and
financial condition.

Failure
to provide reliable service to our utility customers could adversely affect our
operating results -

We are currently obligated to supply electric energy
in parts of Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota.  From time to time and
because of unforeseen circumstances, the demand for electric energy required to
meet these obligations could exceed our available electric generating capability
and energy commitments pursuant to purchased power agreements.  The
North American transmission grid is highly interconnected and, in extraordinary
circumstances, disruptions at particular points within the grid could cause an
extensive power outage in our delivery systems.  Power outages in our
service territories could result from factors outside of our control or service
territories.  If this occurs, we may have to buy electric energy in
the market.  Our utilities may not always have the ability to pass all
the costs of purchasing the electric energy on to their customers, and even if
they are able to do so, there may be a significant delay between the time the
costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered.  Since these
situations most often occur during periods of peak demand, it is possible that
the market price for electric energy at the time we purchase it could be very
high.  Even if a supply shortage was brief, we could suffer
substantial losses that could diminish our financial condition and results of
operations.  The transmission system in our utilities’ service
territories is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy
within our service territories and access electric energy from outside of our
service territories.  The transmission constraints could result in
failure to provide reliable service to our utility customers and the inability
to deliver energy from generating facilities, particularly wind generating
facilities, to the national grid, or not being able to access lower cost sources
of electric energy.  Failure to provide safe and reliable service,
including effects of equipment failures in electric and natural gas delivery
systems and any resulting fines or litigation costs, or market demand for energy
exceeding available supply, may result in reduced revenues and increased
maintenance and capital costs, which could adversely impact our financial
condition and results of operations.


Operation
of electric generating facilities or capital improvement of utility facilities
may involve unanticipated changes or delays in operations that could negatively
impact our business -

The operation of electric generating facilities
involves many risks, including start-up risks, breakdown or failure of
equipment, transmission lines or pipelines, use of technology, the dependence on
a specific fuel source, including the supply and transportation of fuel, as well
as the risk of performance below expected or contracted levels of output or
efficiency.  These risks could negatively impact our business through
asset degradation, lost revenues or increased costs, including the cost of
replacement power.  Additionally, our ability to successfully and
timely complete planned capital improvements to existing facilities within
established budgets is contingent upon many variables and may be subject to
substantial risks.  Should such efforts be unsuccessful, we could be
subject to additional costs and increased risk of non-recovery of construction
or improvement costs through rates, which could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.

Our
operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be
adversely affected by the impacts of weather -

Our electric and gas
utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a
material impact on their operating performance.  Demand for
electricity is greater in the summer months associated with air conditioning
requirements.  In addition, market prices for electricity generally
peak in the summer due to higher demand.  Demand for natural gas
depends significantly upon weather patterns in winter months due to heavy use
for residential and commercial heating.  As a result, our overall
operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal
basis.  In addition, we have historically generated less revenues and
income when weather conditions are warmer in the winter and cooler in the
summer.  Unusually mild winters and summers could have an adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Storms
or natural disasters may impact our operations in unpredictable ways -

Storms or catastrophic natural disasters may impact our
operations.  Storms and natural disasters, such as the flood of 2008
and the ice storms of 2007, may adversely impact our ability to generate,
purchase or distribute electric energy or obtain fuel sources and may
significantly slow growth, or cause a decline, in the economy within our service
territories.  Storms and natural disasters may prevent our customers
from being able to operate, causing lower sales and revenues.  In
addition, we could incur large costs of repairing damage to our generating
facilities and infrastructure due to storms or natural disasters.  The
loss of revenues may not be recovered.  The restoration costs may not
be fully covered by insurance policies.  Damage to assets could also
require us to take impairments.  Some costs may not be recovered in
rates, or there could be significant delays in cost recovery.  Any of
these items could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

We are
subject to limitations on our ability to pay dividends -

Alliant Energy
is a holding company with no significant operations of its
own.  Accordingly, the primary sources of funds for Alliant Energy to
pay dividends to its shareowners are dividends and distributions from its
subsidiaries.  Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal
entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to us, whether by dividends,
loans or other payments.  The ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make distributions to us and, accordingly, our ability to pay
dividends on Alliant Energy common stock will depend on regulatory limitations
and the earnings, cash flows, capital requirements and general financial
condition of our subsidiaries.  Our utilities each have dividend
payment restrictions based on the terms of their outstanding preferred stock and
regulatory limitations applicable to them.  If we do not receive
adequate dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries, then we may not be
able to make, or may have to reduce, dividend payments on Alliant Energy common
stock.

Threats
of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism may impact
our operations in unpredictable ways -

We are subject to direct and
indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities.  Generation and
transmission facilities, in general, have been identified as potential
targets.  The effects of terrorist threats and activities include,
among other things, terrorist actions or responses to such actions or threats,
the inability to generate, purchase or transmit electric energy, the risk of
significant slowdown in growth or a decline in the U.S. economy, disruption or
volatility in, or other effects on capital markets, and the increased cost and
adequacy of security and insurance.  Terrorist threats and activities
may adversely impact our ability to generate, purchase or distribute electric
energy or obtain fuel sources and may significantly slow growth, or cause a
decline, in the economy within our service territories, which could adversely
impact our financial condition and results of operations.  In
addition, the cost of repairing damage to our generating facilities and
infrastructure due to acts of terrorism, and the loss of revenue if such events
prevent us from providing utility service to our customers, could adversely
impact our financial condition and results of operations.


Energy
industry changes could have a negative effect on our businesses -

As a
public utility company with significant utility assets, we conduct our utility
operations in a regulated business environment.  The advent of new and
unregulated markets has the potential to significantly impact our financial
condition and results of operations.  The evolution of the wholesale
and transmission markets has the potential to significantly increase costs of
transmission, costs associated with inefficient generation dispatching, costs of
participation in the new markets and costs stemming from estimated payment
settlements.  Competitive pressures, including advances in technology
that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy to a
level that is competitive with that of current electric production methods,
could result in our utilities losing market share and customers and incurring
stranded costs (i.e., assets and other costs rendered unrecoverable through
customer rates as a result of competitive pricing), which would be borne by our
shareowners.  Increased competition from any restructuring efforts in
our primary retail electric service territories may have a significant adverse
impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Shareowner
Derivative Compl

a

i

nt

-

On Feb. 27, 2009, a purported shareowner filed in the Circuit Court for
Dane County, Wisconsin, a derivative complaint against certain current and
former officers and directors of Alliant Energy alleging that such officers and
directors breached their fiduciary duties by approving sales of assets of
Resources in violation of the Indenture with respect to the Exchangeable Senior
Notes due 2030 and wasting Alliant Energy’s assets by compensating such officers
and directors in connection with such sales.  Alliant Energy believes
the derivative complaint is without merit and intends to vigorously defend
against this litigation.  The purported shareowner had previously made
a demand asking the Board of Directors to take action to remedy the alleged
breaches of fiduciary duties by certain officers and directors.  Under
Wisconsin law, if a shareowner commences a derivative proceeding after making
such a demand, the court must dismiss such a derivative proceeding if a
committee of independent directors appointed by independent directors
determines, acting in good faith after conducting a reasonable inquiry upon
which its conclusions are based, that maintenance of the derivative proceeding
is not in the best interests of the corporation.  The independent
directors of Alliant Energy appointed such a special litigation committee of
independent directors, which conducted an inquiry into the allegations made in
the demand from the purported shareowner and in a report delivered to Alliant
Energy determined that maintenance of the derivative proceeding is not in the
best interests of Alliant Energy.  Based on that report, on Sep. 14,
2009, Alliant Energy filed a motion to dismiss the derivative proceeding in the
Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin.

Air
Permitting Violation Claims

-

In October 2009, WPL, as an owner and the operator of the Nelson Dewey
Generating Station (Nelson Dewey) and the Columbia Energy Center (Columbia),
received from Sierra Club a notice of intent to file a civil lawsuit (NOI) based
on allegations that modifications were made at those facilities without
complying with the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program
requirements, Title V Operating Permit requirements of the CAA and state
regulatory counterparts contained within the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan
(SIP) designed to implement the CAA.  In December 2009, WPL received
from Sierra Club a separate NOI, which contained similar allegations regarding
the Edgewater Generating Station (Edgewater).  The NOIs allege that
various projects performed at Nelson Dewey, Columbia and Edgewater in years past
were major modifications, as defined in the CAA, and that the owners violated
the CAA when they undertook those projects without obtaining permits and
installing the best available emission controls for SO2, NOx and particulate
matter.  In the Edgewater NOI, additional allegations were made
regarding violations of emission limits for visible emissions.

In
December 2009, the EPA sent a Notice of Violation (NOV) to WPL as an owner and
the operator of Nelson Dewey, Columbia and Edgewater.  The NOV alleges
that the owners failed to comply with appropriate pre-construction review and
permitting requirements and as a result violated the PSD program requirements,
Title V Operating Permit requirements of the CAA and the SIP.

If
pursued successfully by the EPA and/or the Sierra Club, these actions could
result in civil penalties in amounts of up to $37,500 per day for each violation
and/or injunctive relief to require installation of pollution control technology
at Nelson Dewey, Columbia and Edgewater, which would increase future capital and
operating expenditures of Alliant Energy and WPL.  Alliant Energy and
WPL are currently reviewing the allegations and are unable to predict the impact
of the allegations on their financial conditions or results of operations, but
believe that an adverse outcome could be significant.  WPL and the
other owners of Columbia and Edgewater are exploring settlement options with
each of the EPA and Sierra Club while simultaneously defending against these
actions.  WPL believes the projects at Nelson Dewey, Columbia and
Edgewater were routine or not projected to increase emissions therefore did not
violate the permitting requirements of the CAA.

In addition to
any legal proceedings discussed in Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s reports to
the SEC, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently, and from time to time,
subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of
business.  Although the results of these legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of
these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on Alliant Energy’s,
IPL’s or WPL’s financial condition or results of operations.

Shareowners

- - At Dec. 31, 2009, there were approximately 37,480 holders of record of Alliant
Energy’s common stock, including holders through Alliant Energy’s Shareowner
Direct Plan.  Alliant Energy is the sole common shareowner of all
13,370,788 and 13,236,601 shares of IPL and WPL common stock, respectively,
currently outstanding.

Dividends

- - Alliant Energy does not have any significant common stock dividend
restrictions.  Although Alliant Energy’s practice has been to pay cash
dividends on its common stock quarterly, the timing of payment and amount of
future dividends are necessarily dependent upon future earnings, capital
requirements, general financial conditions, general business conditions, the
ability of Alliant Energy’s subsidiaries to pay dividends, approval from its
Board of Directors and other factors.  In January 2010, Alliant Energy
announced an increase in its expected 2010 annual common stock dividend to $1.58
per share, which is equivalent to a quarterly rate of $0.395 per share,
beginning with the Feb. 12, 2010 dividend payment.  Payment of future
2010 quarterly dividends is subject to the actual dividend declaration by
Alliant Energy’s Board of Directors.

Note 7(a) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
information about IPL’s and WPL’s dividend restrictions and limitations on

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Description
of Business

General

- - Alliant Energy is an investor-owned public utility holding company whose
primary subsidiaries are IPL, WPL, Resources and Corporate
Services.  IPL is a public utility engaged principally in the
generation and distribution of electric energy and the distribution and
transportation of natural gas in selective markets in Iowa and southern
Minnesota.  WPL is a public utility engaged principally in the
generation and distribution of electric energy and the distribution and
transportation of natural gas in selective markets in southern and central
Wisconsin.  WPL also owns an approximate 16% interest in the American
Transmission Company LLC (ATC), a transmission-only utility operating in
Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Minnesota.  Resources is the parent
company for Alliant Energy’s non-regulated businesses.  Corporate
Services provides administrative services to Alliant Energy and its
subsidiaries.  An illustration of Alliant Energy’s primary businesses
is shown below.

Utility
Business -

IPL and WPL own a portfolio of electric generating facilities
located in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including
coal, natural gas and renewable resources.  The output from these
generating facilities, supplemented with purchased power, is used to provide
electric service to approximately 1 million electric customers in the upper
Midwest.  The utility business also procures natural gas from various
suppliers to provide service to approximately 412,000 retail gas customers in
the upper Midwest.  Alliant Energy’s utility business is its primary
source of earnings and cash flows.  The earnings and cash flows from
the utility business are sensitive to various external factors including, but
not limited to, the amount and timing of rate relief approved by regulatory
authorities, the impact of weather and economic conditions on electric and gas
sales volumes and other factors listed in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and
“Forward-looking Statements.”


Non-regulated
Businesses -

Resources manages various businesses including RMT
(environmental, consulting, engineering and renewable energy services),
Transportation (short-line railway and barge transportation services),
Non-regulated Generation (electric generating facilities management), and
several other modest investments.

Parent
and Other -

includes operations of Alliant Energy (parent holding
company) and Corporate Services.

The table
above includes utility, non-regulated and parent earnings (losses) per share
from continuing operations, which are non-GAAP (accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (U.S.)) financial
measures.  Alliant Energy believes utility, non-regulated and parent
earnings (losses) per share from continuing operations are useful to investors
because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends and
provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis
consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and
evaluate its performance.  Alliant Energy’s management also uses
utility earnings per share from continuing operations to determine incentive
compensation.

Utility
Business

- Lower income from continuing operations in 2009 compared to
2008 was primarily due to:

·

higher transmission
      service and pension costs at IPL;

·

lower electric sales
      demand resulting from historically cool weather during the summer of
      2009;

·

higher depreciation
      and interest expense as a result of planned capital
      expenditures;

·

lower electric sales
      demand from industrial customers resulting from unfavorable economic
      conditions in 2009;

·

$0.11 per share of
      income tax benefits recognized in 2008 related to a U.S. federal income
      tax audit;

·

$0.10 per share of
      charges incurred in 2009 for proposed coal plants;
  and

·

$0.07 per share of
      restructuring costs incurred in 2009 related to the elimination of certain
      corporate and operations positions.

These
items were partially offset by:

·

$0.32 per share of
      state income tax benefits in 2009 related to combined reporting for
      corporate income taxation in Wisconsin enacted in 2009 and a decision by
      management to allow WPL to do business in
Iowa;

·

higher electric
      revenues at IPL resulting from an interim retail electric rate increase
      effective March 2009;

·

impacts on margins
      and expenses from the severe Midwest flooding in
  2008;

·

impacts of cost
      saving initiatives implemented in
2009;

·

allowance for funds
      used during construction (AFUDC) for IPL’s Whispering Willow - East wind
      project in 2009; and

·

$0.04 per share of
      regulatory-related credits in 2009 for the recovery of 2008 flood
      costs.

Non-regulated
Businesses

- Lower income from continuing operations in 2009 compared to
2008 was primarily due to:

·

lower earnings at
      RMT resulting from reduced construction activity for wind projects;
      and

·

$0.05 per share of
      state income tax expense in 2009 related to combined reporting for
      corporate income taxation in Wisconsin enacted in
  2009.


Parent
and Other

- Lower income from continuing operations in 2009 compared to
2008 was primarily due to:

·

a $1.16 per share
      loss incurred in 2009 on the early extinguishment of Alliant Energy’s
      Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2030;
and

·

lower interest
      income caused by lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and
      lower interest rates on money market fund
  investments.

These
items were partially offset by $0.09 per share of state income tax benefits in
2009 related to combined reporting for corporate income taxation in Wisconsin
enacted in 2009.

Refer to
“Alliant Energy’s Results of Operations,” “IPL’s Results of Operations” and
“WPL’s Results of Operations” for additional details regarding the various
factors impacting their respective earnings during 2009

, 2008 and 2007.

Strategic
Overview

The
strategic plans for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL focus on investments in new wind
generation to meet customer demand and renewable portfolio standards, emission
controls at their existing fleet of electric generating facilities to meet
environmental regulations and energy efficiency programs.  Key

      meters and gas modules in its service
territory.

Refer to
“Strategic Overview” for additional details regarding these and other strategic
plan developments.

Rate
Matters

Alliant
Energy’s utility subsidiaries, IPL and WPL, are subject to federal regulation by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which has jurisdiction over
wholesale electric rates, and state regulation in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota
for retail utility rates and standards of service.  Key regulatory
developments impacting Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL during 2009 and early 2010
include:

·

March 2009 - IPL
      implemented an interim retail electric rate increase for its Iowa retail
      customers equivalent to approximately $84 million on an annual
      basis.

·

September 2009 - The
      PSCW set WPL’s retail electric fuel rates currently in effect subject to
      refund beginning Sep. 1, 2009 as a result of lower than expected fuel
      costs incurred by WPL.  In January 2010, WPL filed a retail
      electric fuel refund report indicating retail fuel over collections of $4
      million for the final four months of
2009.

·

November 2009 -
      Legislation (2009 Assembly Bill 600) was introduced in Wisconsin to change
      statutes related to the process by which utilities recover electric
      fuel-related costs from their retail electric
  customers.

·

December 2009 - WPL
      received an order from the PSCW authorizing an annual retail electric rate
      increase of $59 million, or approximately 6%, and an annual retail natural
      gas rate increase of $6 million, or approximately 2%, effective January
      2010.  The order also authorized WPL to recover a portion of the
      previously deferred costs for the cancelled Nelson Dewey #3 project and
      certain deferred benefits costs incurred by WPL in
  2009.

·

January 2010 - IPL
      received an order from the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) authorizing a final
      annual retail electric rate increase of $84 million, or approximately 7%,
      plus the use of a portion of IPL’s regulatory liabilities to offset costs
      related to the cancelled Sutherland #4 project and future transmission
      service costs.  The order also authorized IPL to recover $8
      million of flood-related costs incurred in 2008.  Lastly, the
      IUB deferred the decision on IPL’s proposal to implement an automatic cost
      recovery rider for transmission costs until IPL’s next rate
      case.

Refer to
“Rate Matters” for additional details regarding these and other regulatory
developments, including plans to file retail rate cases in Iowa, Wisconsin and
Minnesota in the first half of 2010.


Environmental
Matters

-

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation of environmental matters by
various federal, state and local authorities.  Key environmental
developments during 2009 and early 2010 that may impact Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL include:

·

April 2009 - The
      U.S. Supreme Court granted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
      authority to use a cost-benefit analysis when setting technology-based
      requirements under Section 316(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act (Section
      316(b)).  A revised Section 316(b) rule reflecting the U.S.
      Supreme Court’s decision is anticipated to be proposed by the EPA in
      2010.

·

October 2009 - The
      EPA published the proposed greenhouse gas (GHG) Tailoring rule, which
      could require large industrial facilities to obtain permits that
      demonstrate use of Best Available Control Technologies (BACT) and energy
      efficiency measures to minimize GHG emissions when facilities are
      constructed or significantly
modified.

·

October 2009 - WPL
      received from the Sierra Club a notice of intent to file a civil lawsuit
      (NOI) based on allegations that modifications were made at the Nelson
      Dewey Generating Station (Nelson Dewey) and Columbia without complying
      with air permitting requirements.  In December 2009, the Sierra
      Club sent a separate NOI to WPL containing similar allegations regarding
      the Edgewater Generating Station (Edgewater).  WPL and the other
      owners of Columbia and Edgewater are exploring settlement options with the
      Sierra Club while simultaneously defending against these
      actions.

·

November 2009 - The
      EPA issued a final rule staying the application of the Clean Air
      Interstate Rule (CAIR) annual SO2 and nitrogen oxide (NOx) programs for
      Minnesota.

·

December 2009 - The
      EPA’s Mandatory GHG Reporting rule became effective, which requires
      electric utilities, among other companies, to monitor and report annual
      levels of GHG emissions beginning with calendar year
  2010.

·

December 2009 - The
      EPA published a proposed rule that would establish a new one-hour National
      Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for SO2 and associated monitoring
      requirements.  The final standard is expected by June 2010 and
      final designations of non-attainment areas are expected to be issued by
      June 2012.

·

December 2009 - The
      EPA sent a Notice of Violation (NOV) to WPL as an owner and the operator
      of Nelson Dewey, Columbia and Edgewater.  The NOV alleges that
      the owners failed to comply with appropriate pre-construction review and
      permitting requirements.  WPL and the other owners of Columbia
      and Edgewater are exploring settlement options with the EPA while
      simultaneously defending against these
actions.

·

December 2009 - The
      EPA issued a final rule finding that concentrations of GHG emissions in
      the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare and that emissions from
      motor vehicles contribute to atmospheric concentrations of GHG emissions
      and hence to the threat of climate
change.

·

January 2010 - The
      Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) issued a state thermal
      rule, subject to EPA approval, regulating the amount of heat that
      generating facilities can discharge into Wisconsin
  waters.

·

January 2010 - The
      EPA issued a proposal to reduce the primary NAAQS standard for ozone and
      establish a new seasonal secondary standard for ozone.  The
      final rule is expected to be issued by August 2010 and final designations
      of non-attainment areas are expected to be issued by August
      2011.

·

January 2010 - The
      EPA issued a final rule to strengthen the primary NAAQS for NOx as
      measured by nitrogen dioxide (NO2).  The EPA expects to
      designate non-attainment areas for the new NO2 standard by January
      2012.

·

January 2010 - The
      EPA issued an information collection request for coal- and oil-fired
      electric utility steam generation units over 25 MW in order to develop a
      proposed Utility Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT) standard for
      the control of mercury and other federal hazardous air
      pollutants.  The EPA is currently negotiating a consent decree
      that could require the agency to propose Utility MACT standards no later
      than March 2011 and promulgate final standards no later than November
      2011.

Refer to
“Environmental Matters” for additional details regarding these and other
environmental developments.


Legislative
Matters

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL monitor various legislative developments, including climate
change, tax-related and other matters.  Key legislative developments
impacting Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL during 2009 include:

·

February 2009 - The
      American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was
      enacted.  The most significant provisions of the ARRA for
      Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL provide a one-year extension of the 50% bonus
      depreciation deduction for certain expenditures for property that is
      acquired or constructed in 2009, incentives for wind facilities placed in
      service by Dec. 31, 2012 and grants for qualifying investments that are
      expected to improve the electric grid and transportation

      IPL’s and WPL’s utility service territories.  Additional details
      of energy efficiency plans are included in “Energy Efficiency Programs”
      below.

The
strategic plan for Alliant Energy’s non-regulated operations involves
maintaining a portfolio of businesses that are accretive to earnings but not
significant users of capital.

Utility
Generation Plans

- -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL review and update, as deemed necessary and
in accordance with regulatory requirements, their utility generation
plans.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently evaluating the types
of capacity additions they will pursue to meet their customers’ long-term energy
needs and are monitoring several related external factors that will influence
those evaluations.  Some of these external factors include regulatory
decisions regarding proposed projects, changes in long-term projections of
customer demand, availability and cost effectiveness of different generation
technologies, market conditions for obtaining financing, developments related to
federal and state renewable portfolio standards, environmental requirements for
new generation, such as future carbon and renewable requirements and federal and
state tax incentives.  The following provides details of two
generation projects within the Utility Generation Plans that were completed
during 2009.

Whispering
Willow - East

- In the fourth quarter of 2009, IPL’s 200 MW Whispering
Willow - East wind project located in Franklin County, Iowa, began commercial
operation.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, IPL incurred construction costs for
Whispering Willow - East of $466 million, excluding AFUDC.

Neenah
Energy Facility

- In June 2009, WPL acquired the Neenah Energy Facility
and related assets from Resources for $92 million.  The Neenah Energy
Facility is a 300 MW, simple-cycle, dual-fueled (natural gas/diesel) electric
generating facility located in Neenah, Wisconsin.

The
remaining generation projects in the current utility generation plans for
Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL through 2013 are as follows (Not Applicable (N/A);
To Be Determined (TBD)):


(a) Cost
estimates represent IPL’s or WPL’s estimated portion of the total escalated
construction and acquisition expenditures in millions of dollars and exclude
AFUDC, if applicable.

(b) Costs
represent capitalized expenditures in millions of dollars recorded in “Property,
plant and equipment” on the respective Consolidated Balance Sheets as of Dec.
31, 2009 and exclude AFUDC, if applicable.

Whispering
Willow

- In 2007, IPL acquired approximately 500 MW of wind site capacity
in Franklin County, Iowa referred to as the Whispering Willow wind
project.  IPL utilized 200 MW of this wind site capacity for its
Whispering Willow - East wind project discussed above.  IPL currently
anticipates utilizing 100 MW of the wind site capacity for development of the
second phase of the Whispering Willow wind project, known as Whispering Willow -
West.  IPL plans to utilize the final 100 MW of wind turbine
generators and related equipment under the master supply agreement entered into
with Vestas-American Wind Technology, Inc. (Vestas) in 2008 for the Whispering
Willow-West wind project.  In 2009, IPL made progress payments of $22
million to Vestas for the 100 MW of wind turbine generator sets and related
equipment.  Future development of the remaining 200 MW of the wind
site capacity will depend on numerous factors such as renewable portfolio
standards, availability of wind turbines and transmission
capabilities.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, IPL’s capitalized costs related to
the final 200 MW of wind site capacity held for future development were $10
million.

Bent
Tree

- In March 2009, WPL acquired approximately 400 MW of wind site
capacity in Freeborn County, Minnesota.  WPL plans to use 200 MW of
the capacity from this site for its Bent Tree - Phase I wind
project.  In July 2009, WPL received an order from the PSCW approving
construction of the 200 MW project.  The total project cost approved
by the PSCW is $497 million ($460 million, excluding AFUDC).  WPL must
promptly notify the PSCW if the scope, design or location of the project changes
significantly, or if the project cost exceeds the approved amount by more than
10%.  WPL expects to use traditional rate making procedures for the
recovery of and return on its capital costs for the 200 MW of
capacity.  In October 2009, WPL received an order from the MPUC
approving the Site Permit and Certificate of Need applications.  WPL
plans to utilize 200 MW of wind turbine generator sets and related equipment
under the master supply agreement entered into with Vestas in 2008 for the Bent
Tree - Phase I wind project.  In 2009, WPL made progress payments of
$146 million to Vestas for the 200 MW of wind turbine generator sets and related
equipment.  Construction of Bent Tree - Phase I is expected to begin
in 2010 and the expected commercial operation date is subject to the timing of
remaining local permits and execution of a transmission interconnect
agreement.  Future development of the remaining 200 MW of wind site
capacity will depend on numerous factors such as renewable portfolio standards,
availability of wind turbines and transmission capabilities.  As of
Dec. 31, 2009, WPL’s capitalized costs related to the additional 200 MW of
capacity held for future development were $14 million.

Riverside
Energy Center (Riverside)

- WPL has a purchased power agreement (PPA)
with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation related to Riverside that extends
through May 2013 and provides WPL the option to purchase Riverside at the end of
the PPA term.  For planning purposes, WPL is currently assuming it
will exercise its option to purchase Riverside, a 600 MW natural-gas fired
electric generating facility in Beloit, Wisconsin, to replace the output
currently obtained under the PPA.

Other
Wind Projects

- In March 2009, WPL purchased development rights to a wind
site with the potential to develop an approximate 100 MW of wind capacity in
Green Lake and Fond du Lac Counties in Wisconsin.  Development and
construction of the project will depend on numerous factors such as renewable
portfolio standards, site permitting and environmental approvals, transmission
interconnections and availability of wind turbines.  As of Dec. 31,
2009, WPL’s capitalized costs related to the wind project were $5
million.

Environmental
Compliance Plans

- -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have developed environmental compliance
plans to help ensure cost effective compliance with current and proposed
environmental regulations expected to significantly reduce future emissions of
NOx, SO2 and mercury at their generating facilities.  Details of these
current and proposed environmental regulations are discussed in “Environmental
Matters.”  The current environmental compliance plans for IPL and WPL
include investments in emission controls for their respective electric
generating facilities as well as purchases of emission
allowances.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL review and update, as deemed
necessary and in accordance with regulatory requirements, their environmental
compliance plans to address various external factors.  Some of these
external factors include regulatory decisions regarding proposed emission
control projects, developments related to environmental regulations,
availability and cost effectiveness of different emission reduction
technologies, market prices for emission allowances, market conditions for
obtaining financings and federal and state tax incentives.  The

(a)

Selective
      Catalytic Reduction (SCR)

is a post-combustion process that injects
      ammonia or urea into the stream of gases leaving the generating facility
      boiler to convert NOx emissions into nitrogen and water.  The
      use of a catalyst enhances the effectiveness of the conversion enabling
      NOx emissions reductions of up to
90%.

Baghouse
      / carbon injection process

is a post-combustion process that
      injects carbon particles into the stream of gases leaving the generating
      facility boiler to facilitate the capture of mercury in filters or
      bags.  A baghouse / carbon injection process can remove more
      than 85% of mercury emissions.

Scrubber

is a post-combustion process that injects lime or lime slurry into
      the stream of gases leaving the generating facility boiler to remove SO2
      and capture it in a solid or liquid waste by-product.  A
      scrubber typically removes more than 90% of the SO2 emissions regardless
      of generating facility boiler type or
design.

These
capital expenditure estimates represent IPL’s or WPL’s respective portion of the
total escalated capital expenditures and exclude AFUDC, if
applicable.  Capital expenditure estimates are subject to change based
on future changes to plant-specific costs of emission control technologies and
air quality rules.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently
evaluating their environmental compliance plans for 2013 and beyond and will
update their capital expenditure plans for these periods in the future when the
plans are finalized.  Refer to “Environmental Matters” for additional
details regarding proposed environmental rules that may impact environmental
compliance plans.

IPL’s
Emission Control Projects

- Under Iowa law, IPL is required to file an
Emissions Plan and Budget (EPB) at least bi-annually.  Filing of
annual periodic reports regarding the implementation of IPL’s compliance plan
and related budget is also required under a settlement agreement between IPL and
the Office of Consumer Advocate in Iowa.  An EPB provides a utility’s
compliance plan and related budget to meet applicable state environmental
requirements and federal air quality standards.  IUB approval of an
EPB demonstrates that the IUB believes the EPB is reasonably expected to achieve
cost-effective compliance with applicable state environmental requirements and
federal air quality standards.  In October 2008, the IUB approved the
most recent EPB filed by IPL in March 2008.  In October 2009, IPL
filed its required annual periodic report regarding the implementation of its
compliance plan and related budget as contained in IPL’s EPB filing approved in
October 2008.  IPL’s EPB filing includes the following emission
control projects.

Lansing
Generating Station Unit 4 (Lansing Unit 4)

- IPL is currently installing
a SCR system and baghouse at Lansing Unit 4 to reduce NOx and mercury emissions,
respectively, at the generating facility.  The SCR system for Lansing
Unit 4 was included in IPL’s Amended EPB approved by the IUB in November
2007.  The baghouse for Lansing Unit 4 was included in IPL’s EPB
approved by the IUB in October 2008.  Total capital expenditures,
excluding AFUDC, for the Lansing Unit 4 emission controls are currently
estimated to be $188 million ($94 million for controls to reduce NOx and $94
million for controls to reduce mercury).  As of Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant
Energy and IPL recorded $74 million of capitalized expenditures for the SCR
system and $57 million of capitalized expenditures for the baghouse at Lansing
Unit 4 in “Construction Work in Progress (CWIP)” on their respective
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Remaining capital expenditures for
Lansing Unit 4’s emission controls are included in the above estimates for
Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s environmental compliance plans.  The SCR
system and baghouse at Lansing Unit 4 are expected to be completed by the second
quarter of 2010.  The SCR system and baghouse at Lansing Unit 4 are
expected to support compliance obligations for current and anticipated air
quality regulatory requirements, primarily including CAIR and the Utility MACT
Standard.


Ottumwa
Generating Station (Ottumwa)

- IPL’s current EPB approved by the IUB in
October 2008 included plans to install a baghouse at Ottumwa to reduce mercury
emissions at the generating facility.  The baghouse at Ottumwa is
expected to support compliance obligations for anticipated air quality
regulatory requirements including the Utility MACT Standard.  IPL’s
portion of total capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC, for the baghouse is
currently estimated to be $103 million, a portion of which is included in the
above estimates for Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s environmental compliance
plans.  The project is currently under review to determine whether it
will be included in the next EPB that IPL plans to file in the second quarter of
2010.

WPL’s
Emission Control Projects

- WPL must file a construction application and
receive authorization from the PSCW to proceed with any individual clean air
compliance project containing estimated project costs of $8 million or
more.  In March 2007, the PSCW approved the deferral of the retail
portion of WPL’s incremental pre-certification and pre-construction costs for
current or future clean air compliance rule projects requiring PSCW approval,
effective on the request date of November 2006.  Alliant Energy and
WPL currently anticipate that such deferred costs will be recovered in future
rates and therefore does not expect these costs to have an adverse impact on
their financial condition or results of operations.  WPL has filed
construction applications for the following individual clean air compliance
projects.

Edgewater
Unit 5

- In 2008, WPL filed a certificate of authority with the PSCW to
install a SCR system at Edgewater Unit 5 to reduce NOx emissions at the
facility.  WPL’s portion of the capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC,
for the Edgewater Unit 5 emission controls is currently estimated to be $115
million, a portion of which is included in the above estimates for Alliant
Energy’s and WPL’s environmental compliance plans.  WPL currently
expects the PSCW to issue a ruling on its application in the second quarter of
2010.  The SCR system at Edgewater Unit 5 is expected to support
compliance obligations for current and anticipated air quality regulatory
requirements, primarily including CAIR and the Wisconsin Reasonably Available
Control Technology (RACT) Rule.

Columbia

- - In April 2009, WPL and its co-owners filed a certificate of authority with the
PSCW to install a scrubber and baghouse at Columbia to reduce SO2 and mercury
emissions, respectively, at the generating facility.  WPL’s portion of
the capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC, for the Columbia emission controls is
currently estimated to be $290 million, a portion of which is included in the
above estimates for Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s environmental compliance
plans.  WPL currently expects the PSCW to issue a ruling on its
application in the first quarter of 2010.  The scrubber and baghouse
at Columbia are expected support compliance obligations for current and
anticipated air quality regulatory requirements, primarily including CAIR and
the Wisconsin State Mercury Rule.

Nelson
Dewey

- In 2007, WPL filed a certificate of authority with the PSCW to
install a scrubber and baghouse at the two existing units at Nelson Dewey to
reduce SO2 and mercury emissions, respectively, at the generating
facility.  WPL is re-evaluating this project due to forthcoming
changes in environmental rules and regulations.  There are no capital
expenditures included in the above table relating to this project.

Energy
Efficiency Programs

- Alliant Energy has several energy efficiency
programs that help customers reduce their energy usage through the use of new
energy efficient equipment, products and practices.  The following are
Alliant Energy’s current key energy efficiency programs:

Smart
Grid Initiatives

- Smart Grid initiatives are designed to improve
customer service, enhance energy management and conservation and provide
operational savings through increased efficiencies of IPL’s and WPL’s electric
distribution systems.  AMI is expected to be the foundation for the
Smart Grid in IPL’s and WPL’s service territories.  WPL has completed
approximately 90% of its AMI deployment by installing over 560,000 AMI electric
meters and gas modules in its service territory as of Dec. 31,
2009.  WPL anticipates its total capital expenditures for AMI will be
approximately $110 million ($90 million for the electric portion and $20 million
for the gas portion) upon completion of the deployment in 2010.  IPL
also plans to install AMI in its Iowa and Minnesota service territories at an
estimated cost of approximately $145 million, conditional upon appropriate cost
recovery treatment in its regulatory jurisdictions.


IPL
Ener

gy
Efficiency Plan (EEP) -

In April 2008, IPL filed an EEP for 2009 through
2013 with the IUB.  The EEP includes spending approximately $400
million for electrical and natural gas energy efficiency programs in Iowa over
the next five years, and aspires to conserve electric and gas usage equal to
that of more than 100,000 homes.  In accordance with Iowa law, IPL is
required to file an EEP every five years.  An EEP provides a utility’s
plan and related budget to achieve specified levels of energy
savings.  IUB approval demonstrates that the IUB believes that IPL’s
EEP is reasonably expected to achieve cost-effective delivery of the energy
efficiency programs.  To the extent approved by the IUB, costs
associated with executing the EEP are recovered from ratepayers through an
additional tariff called an Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery (EECR)
factor.  The EECR factors are revised annually and include a
reconciliation to eliminate any under- or over-recovery of energy efficiency
expenses from prior periods.  There are no carrying costs associated
with the cost recovery factors.  In March 2009, the IUB approved new
EECR factors for IPL’s electric and gas retail customers for the period from
April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010.  The new EECR factors are based
on IPL’s approved budget as filed with its EEP for 2009 through 2013, along with
any over- or under-collection from the prior year and therefore are not expected
to have a material impact on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s financial condition or
results of operations.

Focus
on Energy Program

- WPL contributes 1.2% of annual retail utility
revenues to help fund Focus on Energy, Wisconsin’s statewide energy efficiency
and renewable energy resource program.  Focus on Energy works with
eligible Wisconsin residents and businesses to finance and install energy
efficiency and renewable energy equipment.  Contributions to Focus on
Energy are recovered from WPL’s retail rate payers.

Shared
Savings Programs

- IPL and WPL offer energy efficiency programs to
certain customers in Minnesota and Wisconsin referred to as Shared Savings
programs.  These programs provide low-cost financing to help customers
identify, purchase and install energy efficiency improvement
projects.  The customers repay IPL and WPL with monthly payments over
a term up to five years.

RATE MATTERS

Overview

-

Alliant Energy has two utility subsidiaries, IPL and
WPL.  Alliant Energy’s utility subsidiaries are subject to federal
regulation by FERC, which has jurisdiction over wholesale electric rates,
electric transmission and certain natural gas facilities, and state regulation
in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota for retail utility rates and standards of
service.  Such regulatory oversight also covers IPL’s and WPL’s plans
for construction and financing of new generation facilities and related
activities.

Retail
Base Rate Filings

-

Details of IPL’s and WPL’s retail base rate cases impacting its
historical and future results of operations are as follows (dollars in millions;
Electric (E); Gas (G); Not Applicable (N/A)):

(a)
Interim rates are implemented (without regulatory review for IPL), subject to
refund, pending determination of final rates.  The amount of the
interim rates is replaced by the amount of final rates once the final rates are
granted.

WPL’s
Retail Rate Case (2010 Test Year) -

In May 2009, WPL filed a request with
the PSCW to increase annual retail electric rates by $86 million, or
approximately 9%, and increase annual retail natural gas rates by $6 million, or
approximately 3%.  The request was based on a 2010 forward-looking
test year.  The key drivers for the filing included recovery of
infrastructure costs of the electric and natural gas utility systems, which had
been impacted by a material reduction in sales and increased
costs.  In addition, WPL requested recovery of the remaining retail
portion of the deferred costs for its cancelled Nelson Dewey #3
project.  In September 2009, WPL revised its request to an annual
electric retail rate increase of $99 million and annual retail natural gas rate
increase of $8 million.  The increase in the requested amount for the
retail electric rates was primarily due to increased infrastructure costs and a
reduced 2010 sales forecast.


In
December 2009, WPL received an order from the PSCW authorizing an annual retail
electric rate increase of $59 million, or approximately 6%, and an annual retail
natural gas rate increase of $6 million, or approximately 2%, effective January
2010.  The PSCW order included the following details:

·

Return on common
      equity of 10.4%

·

Regulatory capital
      structure comprised of 50.4% common equity, 43.3% long-term debt, 3.9%
      short-term debt and 2.4% preferred
equity

·

Weighted average
      cost of capital of 8.18%

·

2010 average rate
      base of $1.38 billion for retail electric and $0.21 billion for retail
      natural gas.

The
December 2009 order from the PSCW also approved recovery of certain deferred
benefits costs incurred by WPL in 2009 and a portion of the previously deferred
costs for the cancelled Nelson Dewey #3 project.  Refer to Note 1(b)
of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” and “Alliant
Energy’s Results of Operations” for further discussion regarding the PSCW’s
decision regarding recovery of these deferred costs and regulatory-related
charges in 2009 for the portion of the cancelled Nelson Dewey #3 costs that WPL
was denied recovery.

The 2010
retail electric rate relief approved by the PSCW includes an amount that
represents a current return on 50% of the estimated CWIP for WPL’s Bent Tree -
Phase I wind project for 2010.  The remaining CWIP balance for its
Bent Tree - Phase I wind project will accrue AFUDC during 2010.  In
addition, the PSCW authorized WPL to defer the retail portion of return on rate
base, depreciation expense and other operation and maintenance expenses for
those portions of the Bent Tree -Phase I wind project placed in service in
2010.

WPL’s
Retail Rate Case (2009/2010 Test Period) -

In February 2008, WPL filed a
request with the PSCW to increase current retail electric rates by $93 million,
or approximately 9%, and reduce current retail gas rates by $1 million, or
approximately 1%, effective Jan. 1, 2009.  The electric request was
based on a 2009 forward-looking test year with approval to reopen the case to
address limited cost drivers for 2010.  The electric request reflected
recovery for increased projected spending on electric generation infrastructure,
environmental compliance and stewardship, enhanced investment in renewable
energy projects, stepped-up customer energy efficiency and conservation efforts,
and related electric transmission and distribution costs.  The gas
request was based on an average of 2009 and 2010 projected costs.

Through
the course of the PSCW audit, the 2009 request was updated for various new cost
estimates and removal of capital projects that had not yet been approved by the
PSCW.  These projects include Bent Tree - Phase I, Nelson Dewey #3
(subsequently rejected by the PSCW in December 2008) and various environmental
compliance projects.  WPL received approval from the PSCW for the Bent
Tree - Phase I wind project in 2009, and it was subsequently included in WPL’s
2010 retail rate case.

In
December 2008, WPL and major intervenors in the case reached a stipulated
agreement on electric and gas rate changes for 2009.  The parties
agreed to hold retail electric rates flat and decrease retail gas rates by $4
million.  The stipulated agreement also included a provision that
authorized WPL to defer, and record carrying costs on, the retail portion of
pension and benefit costs in excess of $4 million, any change in the retail
portion of network wheeling costs charged by ATC that is different than the $82
million included in rates and any change in the retail portion of emission
allowance expense that is different than $2 million.  In addition, the
stipulated agreement included the recovery of $9 million over a two-year period
for pre-certification costs related to the Nelson Dewey #3 project that had been
incurred through December 2007.  The PSCW approved the stipulations in
December 2008.

WPL’s
Retail Rate Case (2008 Test Year) -

In April 2007, WPL filed a request
with the PSCW to reopen its 2007 retail rate case for the limited purpose of
increasing electric retail rates in an amount equal to deferral credits that
were fully amortized on Dec. 31, 2007.  WPL also requested
clarification that it is authorized to record AFUDC on all CWIP balances in
excess of the CWIP balance included in the 2007 test year.  In
November 2007, the PSCW issued a final written order approving an annual
electric retail rate increase of $26 million effective Jan. 1, 2008 and
approving WPL’s requested clarification regarding AFUDC and CWIP.

IPL’s
Iowa Retail Rate Case (2008 Test Year) -

In March 2009, IPL filed a
request with the IUB to increase annual electric rates for its Iowa retail
customers by $171 million, or approximately 17%.  The filing was based
on a 2008 historical test year as adjusted for certain known and measurable
changes occurring up to 12 months after the commencement of the
proceeding.  The key drivers for the filing included recovery of
increased costs and capital investments since IPL’s last Iowa electric retail
rate case filed in 2004.  These increased costs and capital
investments included increased costs for electric transmission service,
infrastructure investments completed during the past five years to enhance the
reliability of IPL’s electric system and lower emissions at its generating
facilities, increased costs for pension and other employee benefits, capital
investments and operating expenses incurred by IPL to restore electric service
following 2007 winter ice storms and 2008 severe flooding that impacted its Iowa
electric service territory, and capital expenditures for the cancelled
Sutherland #4 project.  In September 2009, IPL revised this request to
seek an increase of $146 million, or approximately 14%.  The decrease
in the requested amount was primarily due to an alternative cost recovery
process for the capitalized expenditures for Sutherland #4 discussed below and
an alternative method (five-year average) for calculating the annual recovery
amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs.


In
January 2010, IPL received an order from the IUB authorizing a final annual
retail electric rate increase of $84 million, or approximately 7%, plus the use
of a portion of IPL’s regulatory liabilities to offset costs related to the
cancelled Sutherland #4 project and future electric transmission service
costs.  The IUB order included the following details:

·

Return on common
      equity of 10.5% for all non-Emery Generating Station-related
      capital

(Emery
Generating Station-related capital has a previously approved return on common
equity of 12.23%)

·

Regulatory capital
      structure comprised of 49.5% common equity, 43.5% long-term debt and 7.0%
      preferred equity

·

Weighted average
      cost of capital of 8.76% for all non-Emery Generating Station-related
      capital

·

2008 average rate
      base of $1.82 billion for retail
electric.

Refer to
Note 1(b) of “Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
additional discussion of the IUB’s decision in its January 2010 order to allow
IPL to recover $8 million of flood-related costs incurred in 2008 and to use
regulatory liabilities to offset the recovery of $26 million of costs incurred
for the cancelled Sutherland #4 base-load project and $46 million of
transmission costs expected to be billed to IPL in 2010 related to ITC Midwest
LLC’s (ITC’s) 2008 transmission revenue true-up adjustment.

Planned
Utility Rate Cases in 2010 -

IPL expects to file an Iowa retail electric
rate case in March 2010 based on a 2009 historical test period.  The
key drivers for the filing include recovery of investments in the Whispering
Willow - East wind project and emission control projects at Lansing Unit 4 and
recovery of increased electric transmission service costs.  Any rate
changes are expected to be implemented in two phases with interim rates
effective approximately 10 days after the filing and final rates effective
approximately 11 months after the March filing date.  IPL also
anticipates filing a retail electric rate case in Minnesota in the second
quarter of 2010.  Any rate changes in Minnesota are currently expected
to be implemented in two phases with interim rates effective approximately two
months after the filing and final rates effective approximately 10 months after
the filing date.

WPL
expects to file a retail electric and gas rate case in March 2010 based on a
forward-looking test period that includes 2011 and 2012.  The key
drivers for the filing include recovery of investments in WPL’s Bent Tree -
Phase I wind project and other infrastructure projects.  Any rate
changes granted are expected to be effective on Jan. 1, 2011, which is the start
of the test-year period.

Other
Utility Rate Case Information -

With the exception of recovering a return
on additions to IPL’s and WPL’s infrastructure, a significant portion of the
rate increases included in the above table reflect a recovery of increased costs
incurred or expected to be incurred by IPL and WPL and the impact of lower
sales.  Thus, increases in revenues from rate increases cannot be
expected to result in an equal increase in income before income taxes to either
IPL or WPL, as applicable.

Retail
Fuel-related Rate Filings

-
Details of WPL’s retail fuel-related rate filings impacting its historical
results of operations are as follows:

Test Year -

In August 2009, WPL notified the PSCW that its actual retail
fuel-related costs incurred during the month of July 2009 were below the monthly
monitoring range of plus or minus 8% and projected annual retail fuel-related
costs for 2009 could fall outside the annual monitoring range of plus or minus
2%.  In September 2009, the PSCW issued an order that set WPL’s retail
electric fuel rates currently in effect subject to refund beginning Sep. 1,
2009.  In January 2010, WPL filed a retail electric fuel refund report
indicating retail fuel over collections of $4 million for the period from Sep.
1, 2009 through Dec. 31, 2009.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, WPL reserved $4
million, including interest, for refunds anticipated to be paid to its retail
electric customers.  WPL currently expects to receive the PSCW’s
decision and complete any refunds to its retail electric customers in the second
quarter of 2010.


Test Year -

In March 2008, WPL filed a request with the PSCW to increase
annual retail electric rates by $16 million to recover anticipated increased
electric production fuel and energy purchases (fuel-related
costs).  Actual fuel-related costs through February 2008, combined
with projections of continued higher fuel-related costs for the remainder of
2008, significantly exceeded the amounts being recovered in retail electric
rates at the time of the filing.  In the second quarter of 2008, WPL
received an order from the PSCW authorizing the requested $16 million interim
increase, subject to refund, effective in April 2008.  Retail
fuel-related costs incurred by WPL in 2008 were lower than retail fuel-related
costs used to determine interim rates that were effective April 2008, resulting
in $23 million, including interest, of refunds owed to its retail electric
customers.  WPL refunded the $23 million to its retail electric
customers in 2009.

Test Year -

In May 2007, WPL notified the PSCW that its actual average
fuel-related costs for the month of March 2007 had fallen below the monthly fuel
monitoring range set in WPL’s most recent retail rate case and that projected
average fuel-related costs for 2007 could be below the annual monitoring range
to an extent that would warrant a decrease in retail electric
rates.  In June 2007, the PSCW issued an order that set WPL’s retail
electric rates currently in effect subject to refund beginning June 1,
2007.  Retail fuel-related costs incurred by WPL for the period from
June 1, 2007 to Dec. 31, 2007 were lower than retail fuel-related costs used to
determine rates during such period resulting in $22 million, including interest,
of refunds owed to its retail electric customers.  WPL completed these
refunds by reimbursing its retail electric customers $4 million in 2007, $16
million in 2008 and $2 million in 2009.

Refer to
“B. Information Relating to Alliant Energy on a Consolidated Basis - Regulation
- - PSCW - Retail Fuel-related Cost Recovery Mechanisms” in Item 1 Business for
additional details of WPL’s electric fuel-related cost recovery
mechanism.

WPL’s
Wholesale Rate Filing

- In December 2006, WPL received an order from FERC
authorizing an interim rate increase, subject to refund, effective June 1, 2007
related to WPL’s request to implement a formula rate structure for its wholesale
electric customers.  In February 2008, final written agreements were
filed with FERC that contained a settlement between WPL and its wholesale
customers of the issues identified in WPL’s filing requesting the formula rate
structure.  In August 2008, FERC approved the settlement and the
implementation of settlement rates effective June 1, 2008.  During the
period the interim rate increase was effective from June 1, 2007 to May 31,
2008, WPL over-recovered $10 million, including interest, from its wholesale
customers.  In September 2008, WPL refunded the $10 million to its
wholesale electric customers.

Authorized
Return on Equity

-

At Dec. 31, 2009, IPL’s and WPL’s most recently authorized return on
common equity for each of its key jurisdictions were as follows:

Proposed
Changes to Rate Recovery Mechanisms

IPL’s
Iowa Transmission Rider -

In 2009, IPL filed a proposal with the IUB to
implement an automatic cost recovery rider for annual changes in electric
transmission service costs.  The proposed automatic cost recovery
rider would not require a base rate case for annual revisions of rates charged
to IPL’s Iowa retail electric customers, but would require that the electric
transmission service costs incurred be fully reconciled against the revenues
collected for such costs.  In its January 2010 order, the IUB deferred
the decision on IPL’s proposal to IPL’s next filed rate case.

IPL’s
Minnesota Transmission Rider -

In January 2010, IPL filed a proposal with
the MPUC to implement an automatic cost recovery rider for annual changes in
electric transmission service costs.  The proposed automatic cost
recovery rider would not require a base rate case for annual revisions of rates
charged to IPL’s Minnesota retail electric customers, but would require that the
electric transmission service costs incurred be fully reconciled against the
revenues collected for such costs.  IPL is currently unable to
determine when the MPUC will take action on this request.


WPL’s
Wholesale Formula Rate Change -

In August 2009, WPL filed a request with
FERC requesting approval of changes to WPL’s wholesale formula rates in order to
implement for billing purposes the full impact of accounting for defined benefit
postretirement plans.  In October 2009, WPL wholesale customers
requested that FERC suspend the August 2009 filing and set up an evidentiary
hearing to be held pending the outcome of settlement discussions.

Electric
Fuel-related Cost Recovery Mechanism in Wisconsin -

In November 2009,
legislation (2009 Assembly Bill 600) was introduced in Wisconsin to change
statutes related to the process by which utilities recover electric fuel-related
costs from their retail electric customers.  If approved, the new
electric fuel-related costs recovery mechanism would allow Wisconsin utilities
to automatically defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a
symmetrical cost tolerance band and reflect the over/under recovery of these
deferred costs in future billings to its retail customers.  This
change would eliminate the current regulatory lag between the point in time
fuel-related costs fall outside tolerance bands and the point in time when new
rates are placed into effect.  The PSCW supports this
legislation.  In February 2010, the Wisconsin Assembly approved the
2009 Assembly Bill 600.  However, Alliant Energy and WPL are unable to
predict whether the legislation will be enacted.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Overview

-

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation of environmental
matters by federal, state and local authorities as a result of their current and
past operations.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL monitor these
environmental matters and address them with pollution abatement
programs.  These programs are subject to continuing review and are
periodically revised due to various factors, including changes in environmental
regulations, litigation of environmental requirements, construction plans and
compliance costs.  There is currently significant regulatory
uncertainty with respect to the various environmental rules and regulations
discussed below.  Given the dynamic nature of environmental
regulations and other related regulatory requirements, IPL and WPL have
established an integrated planning process that is used for environmental
compliance of their future anticipated operations.  Alliant Energy,
IPL and WPL anticipate future expenditures for environmental compliance will be
material including significant capital investments.  Alliant Energy
anticipates that prudent expenditures incurred by IPL and WPL to comply with
environmental requirements likely would be recovered in rates from its
customers.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Environmental Compliance
Plans” for details of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s environmental compliance
plans, including estimated capital expenditures.  The following are
major environmental matters that could potentially have a significant impact on
Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s financial condition and results of
operations.

Air
Quality

-

The Clean Air Act (CAA) and its amendments mandate preservation of air
quality through existing regulations and periodic reviews to ensure adequacy of
these provisions based on scientific data.  As part of the basic
framework under the CAA, the EPA is required to establish NAAQS, which serve to
protect public health and welfare.  These standards address six
“criteria” pollutants, four of which are particularly relevant to Alliant
Energy’s electric utility operations, including NOx, SO2, particulate matter
(PM), and ozone.  Ozone is not directly emitted from Alliant Energy’s
generating facilities; however, NOx emissions may contribute to its formation in
the atmosphere.  Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) may also be formed in
the atmosphere from SO2 and NOx emissions.

State
implementation plans (SIPs) document the collection of regulations that
individual state agencies will apply to maintain NAAQS and related CAA
requirements.  The EPA must approve each SIP and if a SIP is not
acceptable to the EPA or if a state chooses not to issue separate state rules,
then the EPA can assume enforcement of the CAA in that state by issuing a
federal implementation plan (FIP).  Areas that comply with NAAQS are
considered to be in attainment, whereas routinely monitored locations that do
not comply with these standards may be classified by the EPA as non-attainment
and require further actions to reduce emissions.  Additional emissions
standards may also be applied under the CAA regulatory framework beyond the
NAAQS.  The specific federal and state regulations that may affect
Alliant Energy’s operations include: CAIR, Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR),
Wisconsin State Mercury Rule, Wisconsin RACT Rule, MACT standards and NAAQS
rules.  Alliant Energy also monitors various other potential
environmental matters related to air quality, including: litigation of various
federal rules issued under the CAA statutory authority; revisions to the New
Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permitting programs
and New Source Performance Standards; and proposed legislation or other
regulatory actions to regulate the emission of GHG.


CAIR -

CAIR was issued by the EPA in 2005 to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx
from electric generating units with greater than 25 MW of
capacity.  CAIR established new SO2 and NOx (both annual and ozone
season) emission caps beginning in 2010 and 2009, respectively, with further
reductions in SO2 and NOx emission caps effective in 2015.  CAIR
included a large regional cap-and-trade system, where compliance may be achieved
by either adding emission controls and/or purchasing emission
allowances.  In July 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit (D.C. Circuit Court) vacated CAIR in its entirety.  In
September 2008, the EPA and other affected parties filed petitions requesting
the D.C. Circuit Court review this decision, including a request that CAIR be
remanded to the EPA for reconsideration and not vacated in its
entirety.  In December 2008, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an order
that denied rehearing of the original court decision and also remanded (rather
than vacated) CAIR to the EPA for revision to address flaws identified in the
July 2008 opinion in the case.  The impact of the court’s remand of
CAIR to the EPA is that CAIR obligations became effective Jan. 1,
2009.  The EPA has indicated that a revised CAIR proposal is expected
to be issued by May 2010 and the final revised rule is expected to be issued 12
to 14 months later.

The 2008
court ruling may have an indirect impact on the CAVR issued by the EPA in 1999
and related Best Available Retrofit Technology Rule (BART) determination
guidance in 2005 to address regional haze as discussed below.  The
EPA’s response to this court decision and associated implications to IPL and WPL
are uncertain at this time.  There are also uncertainties regarding
the state regulations in Iowa and Wisconsin that were adopted to implement CAIR
and state responses when a federal CAIR replacement rule is finalized by the
EPA.

In
November 2009, the EPA took final action to address one issue under CAIR related
to the inclusion of Minnesota in the CAIR program.  At issue were
claims that the EPA had included Minnesota in the CAIR region based on
inaccurate data and that use of better data would result in Minnesota falling
below the threshold impact level.  Consistent with the 2008 court
ruling, the EPA issued a final rule staying the application of the CAIR annual
SO2 and NOx programs for Minnesota.  The final rule retired the annual
2009 NOx emission allowances allocated to owners of Minnesota generating
facilities.  The EPA’s CAIR replacement rule will further assess
whether or not Minnesota will be included in the future as part of the CAIR
region based on revised thresholds.

IPL and
WPL are currently unable to predict the final outcome of the EPA’s further work
on a replacement rule for CAIR, but expect that capital investments and/or
modifications resulting from the replacement air quality rules that address SO2
and NOx emissions could be significant.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL
continue to implement their environmental compliance plans to meet the currently
effective CAIR requirements, which include investments in emission controls for
electric generating facilities as well as purchases of emission
allowances.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL will closely monitor future
developments relating to the CAIR regulations and update their environmental
compliance plans as needed.

CAVR -

CAVR requires states to develop and implement SIPs to address visibility
impairment in designated national parks and wilderness areas across the country
with a national goal of no impairment by 2064.  Affected states
including Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota were required to submit a CAVR SIP to
the EPA by December 2007 to include BART emission controls and other additional
measures needed for reducing state contributions to regional
haze.  Iowa submitted its Regional Haze SIP for EPA review and
approval in March 2008.  Minnesota and Wisconsin have not yet
submitted a CAVR SIP for EPA review.  In January 2009, the EPA found
both Minnesota and Wisconsin to be deficient regarding the CAVR SIP
submittal.  The EPA is now required to promulgate a FIP within two
years.  However, the FIP requirement is void if a state submits a
regional haze SIP, and the EPA approves that SIP within the two-year
period.  Electric generating facility emissions of primary concern for
BART and regional haze regulation include SO2, NOx and PM.  There are
pending obligations under the EPA’s CAVR to complete BART determinations that
would evaluate control options to reduce these emissions at certain WPL and IPL
units that were built between 1962 and 1977.  The D.C. Circuit Court
CAIR ruling in 2008 may have an indirect impact on the CAVR and BART SIP
implementation approach because the EPA allowed for BART obligations for SO2 and
NOx emissions to be fulfilled by the CAIR program.  As a result of the
D.C. Circuit Court CAIR ruling in December 2008 to revise CAIR, there are
uncertainties in the applicability of and compliance outcomes of BART control
approaches that will be approved for inclusion in CAVR SIPs.  In
addition, there are uncertainties whether additional emission reductions could
be required to address regional haze impacts beyond BART.  Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL are unable to predict the impact that CAVR might have on the
operations of existing electric generating facilities until EPA final approval
of state CAVR plans, which is currently expected in 2011.

Utility
MACT Standard -

In February 2009, the EPA filed a motion to dismiss its
request for review of the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision vacating the Clean Air
Mercury Rule.  According to the motion to dismiss, the EPA intends to
develop MACT standards for electric generating units pursuant to Section 112 of
the CAA.  When developing a MACT standard, the EPA looks at the
current level of emissions control achieved by best-performing similar
sources.  These emissions control levels set a baseline, often
referred to as the “MACT floor” for the new standard.  In January
2010, the EPA issued an information collection request for coal- and oil-fired
electric utility steam generating units over 25 MW in order to develop a
proposed Utility MACT standard for the control of mercury and other federal
hazardous air pollutants.  The purpose of the proposed information
collection request is to collect data necessary to identify affected categories
of electric generation units that will be subject to a Utility MACT standard and
to define the MACT floor.  The EPA is currently negotiating a consent
decree that could require the agency to propose Utility MACT standards for coal-
and oil-fired electric generating units no later than March 2011 and promulgate
final standards no later than November 2011.  Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL are currently unable to predict the final outcome of Utility MACT standards
to regulate mercury and other federal hazardous air pollutants from electric
generating units, but expect that capital investments and/or modifications could
be significant to comply with any such regulations.


Wisconsin
State Mercury Rule -

In December 2008, a state-only mercury emission
control rule became effective, which requires electric utility companies in
Wisconsin to reduce annual mercury emissions by 40% from a historic baseline
beginning in 2010.  As part of its environmental compliance plan, WPL
has invested in emission control technologies to meet the 2010 compliance
requirements.  In addition, the Wisconsin State Mercury Rule requires
large coal-fired electric generating units with greater than 150 MW of capacity
to either achieve a 90% annual mercury emissions reduction standard or limit the
annual concentration of mercury emissions to 0.008 pounds of mercury per
gigawatt-hour beginning in 2015.  There is also an alternative
multi-pollutant option that extends the time for compliance with the annual
mercury reduction requirement until 2021, but in addition requires the affected
facilities to achieve NOx and SO2 reductions beyond those currently required by
federal and state regulations.  Other coal-fired electric generating
units between 25 MW and 150 MW of capacity must install BACT by Jan. 1, 2015 to
reduce mercury emissions.  WPL is planning additional investments in
emission controls to meet the post-2010 compliance
requirements.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Environmental Compliance
Plans - WPL’s Emission Control Projects” for discussion of these proposed WPL
emission controls.  WPL continues to evaluate the impact of this state
mercury rule and the federal Utility MACT rule discussed above to determine
further mercury emission reductions that will be required.

Wisconsin
RACT Rule -

In 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in Southeastern
Wisconsin as non-attainment areas for the ozone NAAQS.  This
designation includes Sheboygan County, where WPL operates the Sheboygan Falls
Energy Facility (SFEF) and Edgewater.  In 2007, the Wisconsin DNR
issued a RACT rule that requires NOx emission reductions at electric generating
facilities as part of the federal ozone SIP submittal to address non-attainment
areas in Wisconsin.  Facility modifications are not necessary at SFEF
to comply with this rule.  As part of its environmental compliance
plan, WPL completed investments for installation of NOx emission control
technologies at Edgewater to meet the 2009 to 2012 compliance
requirements.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Environmental Compliance
Plans - WPL’s Emission Control Projects” for discussion of proposed emission
controls for further NOx emission reductions at Edgewater Unit 5 to meet 2013
compliance deadlines.

Ozone
NAAQS Rule -

In March 2008, the EPA announced reductions in the primary
NAAQS for eight-hour ozone to a level of 0.075 parts per million (ppm) from the
previous standard of 0.08 ppm.  A court has challenged that this new
standard is not stringent enough.  In January 2010, the EPA issued a
proposal to reduce the primary standard to a level within the range of 0.060 to
0.070 ppm and establish a new seasonal secondary standard.  The final
rule is expected to be issued by August 2010 and final designations of
non-attainment areas are expected to be issued by August
2011.  Depending on the level and location of non-attainment areas,
Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL may be subject to additional NOx emissions reduction
requirements to meet the new ozone standard.  Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL are currently unable to predict the impact of any potential changes to these
ozone standards on their financial condition and results of
operations.

Fine
Particle NAAQS Rule -

The EPA lowered the 24-hour fine particle primary
NAAQS (PM2.5 NAAQS) from 65 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) to 35 ug/m3 in
2006.  In October 2009, the EPA announced final designation of PM2.5
non-attainment areas.  IPL and WPL do not have any generating
facilities in these non-attainment areas.  However, in February 2009,
the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision for litigation regarding the
EPA’s determination not to lower the annual PM2.5 NAAQS in 2006.  In
response to the litigation decision, the EPA must re-evaluate its justification
for not tightening the annual standard related to adverse effects on health and
visibility.  If the annual PM2.5 standard becomes more stringent, it
could require SO2 and NOx emission reductions in areas designated as
non-attainment.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to
predict the potential impact of the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS re-evaluation on their
financial condition and results of operations.

NO2
NAAQS Rule -

In January 2010, the EPA issued a final rule to strengthen
the primary NAAQS for NOx as measured by NO2.  The final rule
establishes a new one-hour NO2 standard of 100 parts per billion (ppb) and
associated ambient air monitoring requirements, while maintaining the current
annual standard of 53 ppb.  The EPA is expected to designate
non-attainment areas for the new NO2 standard by January
2012.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict the
impact of any potential NO2 standard changes on their financial condition or
results of operations.


SO2
NAAQS Rule -

In December 2009, the EPA published a proposed rule that
would establish a new one-hour NAAQS for SO2 and associated monitoring
requirements.  The proposed rule would revise the primary SO2 standard
to a level of between 50 and 100 ppb measured over one hour.  The EPA
anticipates that a new one-hour standard in the proposed range would prevent SO2
concentrations from exceeding the current 24-hour and annual health-based
standards.  As a result, the EPA is proposing to revoke both of the
current primary SO2 standards.  Alternatively, the EPA is seeking
comment on a one-hour standard of 150 ppb, which would supplement the existing
standards.  The EPA is under a court order to issue a final SO2
standard by June 2010 and is expected to designate non-attainment areas by June
2012.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict the
impact of any potential SO2 standard changes on their financial condition or
results of operations.

Industrial
Boiler and Process Heater MACT Rule -

The EPA’s Industrial Boiler and
Process Heater MACT rule became effective in 2004 and compliance with these new
emission requirements for hazardous air pollutants was required by September
2007.  This rule applies to fossil fuel electric generating units with
less than 25 MW capacity as well as certain auxiliary boilers and process
heaters operated at electric generating facilities.  In June 2007, a
court decision vacated this rule.  The EPA will be revising the
Industrial Boiler and Process Heater MACT rule by April 2010 in response to this
court decision, and the implications to IPL and WPL are uncertain at this
time.  Until the EPA issues a revised Industrial Boiler and Process
Heater MACT rule, the federal CAA generally requires affected facilities to
submit to state permitting authorities an application for a case-by-case MACT
determination for all potentially affected units under this
rule.  Case-by-case MACT determinations are effective compliance
measures until revised final federal regulations can replace these interim
requirements.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL submitted case-by-case
permit application information in 2009.  The outcome of the
case-by-case MACT determinations by the Iowa DNR and Wisconsin DNR are uncertain
at this time.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to
predict the impact of any potential Industrial Boiler and Process Heater MACT
standard changes on their financial condition or results of operations and
continue to monitor related regulatory developments.

Air
Permit Renewals -

WPL is aware of certain public comments or petitions
from citizen groups that have been submitted to the Wisconsin DNR or to the EPA
regarding the renewal of air operating permits at certain of its
facilities.  WPL has since received renewal air permits for Edgewater
and Columbia, which considered all public comments and contain changes to permit
requirements that resulted from the Wisconsin DNR’s review
process.  In December 2008, the Sierra Club submitted a notice of
intent to sue the EPA for failure to respond to its petition encouraging the EPA
to challenge the air permit issued by the Wisconsin DNR for
Columbia.  In October 2009, the EPA responded to the Sierra Club
petition and granted one of three issues from the Sierra Club petition,
objecting to that portion of the permit issued by the Wisconsin
DNR.  The Wisconsin DNR has been working with EPA, and has been in
contact with WPL, related to this matter.  To date, no changes have
been made to the previously issued permit for Columbia.

In
October 2009, the Sierra Club petitioned the EPA to object to a proposed Title V
air permit for Edgewater that the Wisconsin DNR had submitted to the EPA for
review.  The EPA had 60 days from the filing of the petition to
respond.  In October 2009, the Wisconsin DNR issued the Title V air
permit renewal for Edgewater, responding to comments made by the Sierra Club,
which were the foundation for the petition.  In December 2009, the
Sierra Club filed a notice of intent to sue the EPA over its failure to act on
the petition.  The EPA has not yet acted on the petition, and WPL
cannot predict the outcome of the EPA’s response to the Sierra Club petition or
the Sierra Club’s notice of intent to sue the EPA for failure to act on the
petition.

Air
Permitting Violation Claims -

In October 2009, WPL, as an owner and the
operator of Nelson Dewey and Columbia, received from Sierra Club an NOI based on
allegations that modifications were made at those facilities without complying
with the PSD program requirements, Title V Operating Permit requirements of the
CAA and state regulatory counterparts contained within the Wisconsin SIP
designed to implement the CAA.  In December 2009, WPL received from
Sierra Club a separate NOI, which contained similar allegations regarding
Edgewater.  The NOIs allege that various projects performed at Nelson
Dewey, Columbia and Edgewater in years past were major modifications, as defined
in the CAA, and that the owners violated the CAA when they undertook those
projects without obtaining permits and installing the best available emission
controls for SO2, NOx and PM.  In the Edgewater NOI, additional
allegations were made regarding violations of emission limits for visible
emissions.

In
December 2009, the EPA sent an NOV to WPL as an owner and the operator of Nelson
Dewey, Columbia and Edgewater.  The NOV alleges that the owners failed
to comply with appropriate pre-construction review and permitting requirements
and as a result violated the PSD program requirements, Title V Operating Permit
requirements of the CAA and the SIP.


If
pursued successfully by the EPA and/or the Sierra Club, these actions could
result in civil penalties in amounts of up to $37,500 per day for each violation
and/or injunctive relief to require installation of pollution control technology
at Nelson Dewey, Columbia and Edgewater, which would increase future capital and
operating expenditures of Alliant Energy and WPL.  Alliant Energy and
WPL are currently reviewing the allegations and are unable to predict the impact
of the allegations on their financial conditions or results of operations, but
believe that an adverse outcome could be significant.  WPL and the
other owners of Columbia and Edgewater are exploring settlement options with
each of the EPA and Sierra Club while simultaneously defending against these
actions.  WPL believes the projects at Nelson Dewey, Columbia and
Edgewater were routine or not projected to increase emissions therefore did not
violate the permitting requirements of the CAA.

Section
316(b) of Federal Clean Water Act -

The Federal Clean Water Act requires
the EPA to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure that these
structures reflect the “best technology available” for minimizing adverse
environmental impacts to fish and other aquatic life.  The second
phase of this EPA rule became effective in 2004 and is generally referred to as
Section 316(b).  Section 316(b) applies to existing cooling water
intake structures at large steam-electric generating facilities.  In
2007, a court opinion invalidated aspects of the Section 316(b), which allowed
for consideration of cost-effectiveness when determining the appropriate
compliance measures.  As a result, the EPA formally suspended Section
316(b) in 2007.  In April 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the EPA
authority to use a cost-benefit analysis when setting technology-based
requirements under Section 316(b).  A revised Section 316(b) rule
reflecting the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision is anticipated to be proposed by
the EPA in 2010 and a final rule is expected in 2012.  IPL and WPL
have identified seven and three generating facilities, respectively, which may
be impacted by the revised Section 316(b) rule.  Alliant Energy, IPL
and WPL are currently unable to predict the final requirements from Section
316(b), but expect that capital investments and/or modifications resulting from
the rule could be significant.

Wisconsin
State Thermal Rule -

In January 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources
Board adopted a revised thermal rule proposal for regulating the amount of heat
that facilities can discharge into Wisconsin waters.  The rule must
now be approved by the EPA and is anticipated to be effective in the first half
of 2010.  Compliance with the thermal rule will be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis as discharge permits for WPL’s generating facilities are
renewed.  WPL continues to evaluate the thermal rule regulatory
requirements and the compliance options available to meet the heat limitations
for its generating facility discharges into Wisconsin waters.  WPL is
unable to predict the final requirements of this rule until discharge permits
for the impacted facilities are renewed; however, should capital investments
and/or modifications be required, WPL believes these investments could be
significant.

Hydroelectric
Fish Passages and Fish Protective Devices -

In 2002, FERC issued an order
requiring the following actions regarding WPL’s Prairie due Sac hydroelectric
generating facility: 1) develop a detailed engineering and biological evaluation
of potential fish passages for the facility within 12 months; 2) install an
agency-approved fish-protective device at the facility within 12 months; and 3)
install an agency-approved fish passage at the facility within three
years.  The due dates for designing the potential fish passages and
installing the fish-protective device were extended to June 30, 2010, and the
due date for installing the fish passage was extended to Dec. 31,
2012.  In December 2009, WPL completed the installation of an
agency-approved fish protection device at its Prairie du Sac facility as
required by FERC.  Alliant Energy continues to work with the agencies
to design and install the fish passage.  Alliant Energy and WPL
believe the required capital investments and/or modification to comply with the
FERC order for the fish passage at its Prairie du Sac facility could be
significant.

Land
and Solid Waste

-

Manufactured
Gas Plant (MGP) Sites -

IPL and WPL have current or previous ownership
interests in 40 and 14 MGP sites, respectively, previously associated with the
production of gas for which they may be liable for investigation, remediation
and monitoring costs relating to the sites.  IPL and WPL are working
pursuant to the requirements of federal and state agencies to investigate,
mitigate, prevent and remediate, where necessary, the environmental impacts to
property, including natural resources, at and around the sites in order to
protect public health and the environment.  Refer to Note 12(e) of
Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for estimates of
the range of remaining costs to be incurred for the investigation, remediation
and monitoring of IPL’s and WPL’s MGP sites.

Coal
Combustion By-products (CCB) -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are monitoring
potential regulatory changes that may affect the rules for operation and
maintenance of active ash ponds and/or landfills, in the wake of an ash pond
containment berm failure at a different utility.  In 2009, IPL and WPL
responded to information collection requests from the EPA for data on coal ash
surface impoundments at ten and four of their facilities,
respectively.  The EPA is evaluating the responses and has indicated
its intent to issue proposed regulations for public comment in 2010 and final
regulations in 2011.  These proposed regulations may include
additional requirements with significant impact for CCB management, beneficial
use applications and disposal.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are
currently unable to predict the impact of these information collection requests
or potential regulations resulting from such requests.


Closed
Ash Landfill Sites -

In 2004, IPL received communication from the Iowa
DNR regarding an evaluation of groundwater monitoring results for four of its
closed ash landfills and a request to further evaluate potential offsite
groundwater impacts at two of its closed landfills.  The Iowa DNR
approved IPL’s plans to evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at these
two landfills, which were implemented beginning in 2005.  Work was
completed at one of the landfills in 2005.  Work at the other landfill
has not been completed pending access agreements from two neighboring property
owners to install additional groundwater monitoring wells.  One access
agreement was obtained in 2008 and installation of wells at that location was
completed in December 2009.  IPL provides periodic updates to the Iowa
DNR on the status of implementing the monitoring plan.  Results from
this additional monitoring will be evaluated by the Iowa DNR to determine if
further actions are required.

Polychlorinated
Biphenyls (PCBs) -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are monitoring possible
new regulations for PCB that could require replacement of all electrical
equipment containing PCB insulating fluid.  Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL are currently unable to predict the outcome of this possible regulatory
change, but believe that the required capital investment and/or modifications
resulting from these potential regulations could be significant.

EPA
GHG Rulemakings

- Climate change continues to garner public attention
along with support for policymakers to take action to mitigate global
warming.  There is considerable debate regarding the public policy
response that the U.S. should adopt, involving both domestic actions and
international efforts.  Several members of Congress have proposed
legislation to regulate GHG emissions, primarily targeting reductions of carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions.  In addition, efforts are underway by the EPA
to respond to a court ruling that could require rules to reduce GHG emissions,
including assessment of whether or how the agency should regulate GHG
emissions.  Initiatives to address GHG emissions are also underway in
the states covering Alliant Energy’s utility service
territories.  Given the highly uncertain outcome and timing of future
regulations regarding the control of GHG emissions, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL
currently cannot predict the financial impact of any future climate change
regulations on their operations but believe the expenditures to comply with any
new emissions regulations could be significant.  Refer to “Legislative
Matters - Climate Change Legislative Developments” for federal and state
legislative initiatives to address GHG emissions.

EPA
Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule -

In December 2009, the final EPA Mandatory
GHG Reporting rule became effective.  The final rule does not require
control of GHG emissions, rather it requires that sources above certain
threshold levels monitor and report emissions.  The EPA anticipates
that the data collected by this rule will improve the U.S. government’s ability
to formulate a set of climate change policy options.  The GHG
emissions covered by the final EPA reporting rule include CO2, methane (CH4),
nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
perfluorocarbons and other fluorinated gases.  Emissions of GHG will
be reported at the facility level in CO2-equivalent (CO2e) and include those
facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e annually.  The
final rule applies to electric utility and natural gas distribution operations
at Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.  The annual reporting compliance
requirement begins for the calendar year 2010, with the first GHG emissions
reports due by March 31, 2011.

The
primary GHG emitted from Alliant Energy’s utility operations is CO2 from the
combustion of fossil fuels at its larger electric generating
facilities.  Alliant Energy’s annual CO2 emissions from its larger
electric generating facilities, in terms of total mass, ranged from 19 million
tons (or 17 million metric tons) to 24 million tons (or 22 million metric tons)
during the 2005 through 2009 period.  These amounts represent
emissions from IPL’s and WPL’s ownership portion of fossil-fueled electric
generating units with a design nameplate of 25 MW or greater that are required
to be equipped with continuous emissions monitoring systems.  Alliant
Energy is currently updating its emissions monitoring methodologies to capture
all the GHG emissions data required to comply with the EPA’s mandatory GHG
reporting rule.

GHG
Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Finding -

In April 2009, the EPA
issued a “Proposed Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for GHG under
the CAA.”  This proposal includes two distinct findings regarding GHG
emissions under the CAA.  First, the current and projected
concentrations of GHG emissions in the atmosphere threaten the public health and
welfare of current and future generations.  This is referred to as the
endangerment finding and includes the six key GHG emissions identified in the
EPA’s proposed reporting rule.  Second, the combined emissions of CO2,
CH4, N2O, and HFCs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute
to the atmospheric concentrations of these key GHG emissions and hence to the
threat of climate change.  This is referred to as the cause or
contribute finding.  The EPA’s proposed findings do not include any
specific regulations that mandate reductions in GHG
emissions.  However, finalization of these findings is requisite to
EPA’s future issuance of regulations to reduce GHG emissions from motor vehicles
or other emissions sources, which could include electric utility
operations.  In December 2009, the EPA published the final rule for
this finding with an effective date of January 2010.  The final rule
is currently being challenged by several groups in the D.C. Circuit
Court.

The
implications of the EPA’s findings are highly uncertain, including the nature or
timing related to future issuance of regulations mandating reductions of GHG
emissions.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to
predict the final outcome of the EPA’s findings, but expect that expenditures to
comply with any regulations to reduce GHG emissions could be
significant.


GHG
Tailoring Rule -

In October 2009, the EPA published the GHG Tailoring
rule proposal to establish GHG permit applicability thresholds.  This
proposed rule defines when CAA permits under the PSD and Title V programs would
be required for new and existing large industrial facilities.  The
proposed rule would create a new emissions threshold (25,000 tons per year CO2e)
for GHG emissions.  New and significantly modified facilities would be
required to obtain PSD pre-construction permits that demonstrate use of BACT and
energy efficiency measures to minimize GHG emissions.  Existing
facilities may also be required to obtain a revised Title V operating permit if
their GHG emissions exceed the proposed threshold.  A final GHG
Tailoring rule is anticipated in the first half of 2010.  Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict the final outcome of the
EPA’s proposed permitting rule, but expect that expenditures to comply with any
regulations to reduce GHG emissions could be significant.

Chicago
Climate Exchange (CCX) -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL continue to take
voluntary measures to reduce their emissions including CO2 and other GHG as
prudent steps to address potential climate change regulation.  In May
2009, Alliant Energy committed to continued participation in Phase II of the CCX
for the period from 2007 through 2010.  CCX is a voluntary
market-based emissions cap and trade program for reducing GHG emissions,
including CO2.

Refer to
Note 12(e) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,”
Item 1 Business, “Strategic Overview” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources -
Cash Flows - Investing Activities - Construction and Acquisition Expenditures”
for further discussion of environmental matters.

LEGISLATIVE MATTERS

Climate
Change

Legislative
Developments

-

Federal
- -

The U.S. Congress is currently debating various forms of legislation to
regulate GHG emissions, including legislation to create a cap and trade program
(i.e., H.R. 2454 approved by the House in June 2009).  Alliant Energy,
IPL and WPL are not able to determine what, if any, GHG legislation will finally
be enacted, or the impact of such legislation.  If enacted, Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL believe that GHG legislation could have a material adverse
impact on their financial condition and results of operations.

Midwestern
Governors Association GHG Accord (GHG Accord) -

The Midwest Governors
Association began a process in 2007 to develop a series of policy
recommendations and proposals to address various Climate Change GHG
issues.  Various recommendations have come from the process related to
infrastructure siting and carbon sequestration studies.  Other
recommendations outlined a system to enable a regional market-based multi-sector
cap and trade program for GHG reductions.  The recommendations for a
cap and trade system are still under discussion, and any final recommendations
will be advisory only in the form of a model rule.  Any adoption of
any cap and trade or other GHG reduction proposals that are allowed under
interstate commerce and other federal law will have to be adopted by member
states subject to the approval of their legislatures and governors.

Wisconsin
- -

In April 2007, Governor Doyle signed Executive Order 191, which created
the Wisconsin Task Force on Global Warming (GWTF).  In July 2008, the
GWTF issued its final report containing policy recommendations for state-level
actions to address climate change.  The report contains short- and
long-term goals and action items Wisconsin might undertake, and it was
understood legislation would be introduced where needed to accomplish the
recommendations.  In 2009, Senate Bill 450 and Assembly Bill 649
were introduced proposing enactment of some of the GWTF
recommendations.  The most significant provisions of these bills
include: 1) increasing the Wisconsin Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to 20%
by 2020 and 25% by 2025; 2) requiring a portion (6% by 2020 and 10% by 2025) of
the RPS to be met with renewable sources located in Wisconsin; 3)

implementing
a statewide goal of 2% annual energy savings and expanding energy efficiency
programs and spending to accomplish this goal; and 4) allowing the PSCW to
mandate utilities to make power purchases at prices higher than avoided cost
(Feed in Tariffs) from small distributed renewable generation owned by third
parties.  The bills do not propose a Wisconsin or regional cap and
trade regime. Alliant Energy and WPL expect final action on these proposals by
April 2010.  Alliant Energy and WPL are currently unable to determine
what impacts these initiatives will have on their future financial condition or
results of operations.

Iowa
and Minnesota -

No specific GHG legislation is currently being considered
in Iowa or Minnesota.


Other
Recent Legislative Developments

-

American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -

In February 2009, the ARRA was
enacted.  The most significant provisions of the ARRA for Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL provide a one-year extension of the 50% bonus depreciation
deduction for certain expenditures for property that is acquired or constructed
in 2009, incentives for wind facilities placed in service by Dec. 31, 2012 and
grants for qualifying investments that are expected to improve the electric grid
and transportation infrastructure.  Based on capital projects placed
into service in 2009, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL estimate their 2009 bonus tax
depreciation deduction to be approximately $427 million, $337 million and $79
million, respectively.  These 2009 bonus tax depreciation deductions
significantly reduced the amount of cash taxes paid by Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL in 2009.  Refer to “Other Matters - Other Future Considerations”
for additional details of potential incentives for IPL’s and WPL’s proposed wind
projects and grants related to its investments in transportation
infrastructure.  Refer to Note 5 of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of a deferral of Alliant
Energy’s federal tax obligation associated with the repurchase of its
Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2030 based on provisions of the ARRA.

Wisconsin
Senate Bill 62 -

In February 2009, SB 62 was enacted.  The most
significant provision of SB 62 for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL requires combined
reporting for corporate income taxation in Wisconsin beginning with tax returns
filed for the calendar year 2009.  This provision will require legal
entities in which Alliant Energy owns a 50% or more interest to file as members
of a unitary return in Wisconsin.  In addition, the provisions of SB
62 make it unlikely that Alliant Energy will be able to utilize the majority of
its current Wisconsin net operating loss carryforwards before they
expire.  Refer to Note 5 of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” and to “Other Matters - Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates - Income Taxes” for additional discussion of SB 62 and its impact on
Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s financial condition and results of operations
during 2009.

Federal
Healthcare Legislation (Senate Bill H.R. 3590 and House Bill H.R. 3962) -

Both the House and the U.S. Senate approved different versions of
proposed healthcare legislation recently.  Both versions of healthcare
legislation contain a provision that would eliminate the non-taxable status of
the 28% subsidy provided to employers who continue prescription drug coverage
for their retirees.  If healthcare legislation that contains this
provision is enacted, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL expect to record deferred
income tax expense of $10 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively, in
the period the legislation is enacted.

Federal
Regulatory Reform Legislation -

In December 2009, the House approved
comprehensive regulatory reform legislation (H.R. 4173).  The most
significant provision of this legislation for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL would
create Commodities Futures Trading Commission regulations and mandatory clearing
definitions, which may require Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL to post large amounts
of cash collateral related to their derivative instruments.  During
consideration of this legislation, an amendment was approved that narrowed the
definition of major swaps participant to focus on systemic risk, not
counterparty credit risk exposures.  As a result, Alliant Energy, IPL
and WPL as well as other end-users of derivatives may not fall under the scope
of this legislation.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable
to determine the ultimate impact of this proposed legislation on their financial
condition and results of operations.

Overview

-

“Executive Summary” provides an overview of Alliant Energy’s 2009, 2008
and 2007 earnings and the various components of Alliant Energy’s
business.  Additional details of Alliant Energy’s 2009, 2008 and 2007
earnings are discussed below.

Utility
Electric Margins

-

Electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less electric
production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric capacity
expenses.  Management believes that electric margins provide a more
meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating
revenues since electric production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric
capacity expenses are generally passed through to customers, and therefore,
result in changes to electric operating revenues that are comparable to changes
in electric production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric capacity
expenses.  Electric margins and megawatt-hour (MWh) sales for Alliant
Energy were as follows:

vs. 2008 Summary -

Electric margins increased $21 million, or 2% in 2009,
primarily due to the impact of IPL’s 2009 interim retail rate increase effective
March 2009, which increased IPL’s electric revenues by $62 million in 2009, an
estimated $10 million reduction in electric margins in 2008 due to the loss of
retail sales during electric service outages caused by the severe flooding in
IPL’s service territory in 2008, $9 million of lower purchased electric capacity
expenses at WPL related to the RockGen Energy Center (RockGen) PPA, which
terminated in May 2009, $6 million of incremental purchased electric capacity
expenses at IPL in 2008 resulting from the severe flooding, $5 million of higher
energy conservation revenues at IPL, a $4 million regulatory-related credit
recorded by IPL in 2009 related to the IUB’s approval to recover electric
capacity expenses incurred in 2008 related to the severe flooding, and changes
in the recovery of electric production fuel and energy purchases at
WPL.  These items were partially offset by an estimated $33 million
reduction in electric margins from changes in the net impacts of weather
conditions and Alliant Energy’s weather hedging activities, a decrease in
weather-normalized sales volumes, $12 million of higher purchased electric
capacity expenses at WPL related to the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (Kewaunee)
PPA, $6 million of higher purchased electric capacity expenses at IPL related to
the Duane Arnold Energy Center (DAEC) PPA and a $4 million reduction in electric
margins from the impact of annual adjustments to unbilled revenue
estimates.  Changes in energy conservation revenues are largely offset
by changes in energy conservation expenses.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Electric margins decreased $7 million, or 1%, in 2008,
primarily due to $12 million of lower wheeling revenues at IPL largely due to
the sale of its electric transmission assets in December 2007, an $11 million
reduction in electric margins from the impact of electric production fuel and
energy purchases cost recoveries at WPL, an estimated $10 million reduction in
electric margins during 2008 due to the loss of retail sales during electric
service outages caused by the severe flooding in IPL’s service territory in
2008, an estimated $10 million reduction in electric margins from changes in the
net impacts of weather conditions and Alliant Energy’s weather hedging
activities, $6 million of incremental purchased electric capacity expenses at
IPL in 2008 resulting from the severe flooding and lower industrial sales
volumes at WPL due to the negative impact the slowing economy in 2008 had on
WPL’s large industrial customer demand during such period.  These
items were partially offset by $16 million of purchased electric capacity
expenses at WPL in 2007 related to a contract that ended in December 2007, a $9
million impact from changes in annual adjustments to unbilled revenue estimates,
$8 million of lower purchased electric capacity expenses at WPL in 2008 from its
Kewaunee PPA, the loss of retail sales during electric service outages caused by
the winter storms in IPL’s service territory in 2007 and an increase in
weather-normalized sales at IPL partially due to increased industrial sales to
ethanol production facilities in IPL’s service territory.

Electric
Production Fuel and Energy Purchases (Fuel-related) Cost Recoveries -

Alliant Energy burns coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity
at its generating facilities.  The cost of fossil fuels used during
each period is included in electric production fuel expense.  Alliant
Energy also purchases electricity to meet the demand of its customers and
charges these costs to energy purchases expense.  Alliant Energy’s
electric production fuel expense decreased $36 million, or 8%, in 2009 and
decreased $55 million, or 11%, in 2008.  The 2009 decrease was
primarily due to lower coal volumes burned at its generating facilities
resulting from reduced generation needed to serve the lower sales
volumes.  The 2008 decrease was primarily due to lower fuel volumes
burned at IPL’s Emery Generating Station and at the generating facilities
impacted by the severe flooding in IPL’s service territory in
2008.  Alliant Energy’s energy purchases expense increased $84
million, or 20%, in 2009 and increased $75 million, or 22%, in
2008.  The 2009 increase was primarily due to higher energy purchased
volumes and higher costs in 2009 related to derivative instruments used to
mitigate pricing volatility for the electricity purchased to supply to its
customers.  The 2008 increase was primarily due to changes in
commodity prices.  The impact of the changes in energy purchases
volumes were largely offset by the impact of changes in bulk power sales volumes
discussed below.


Due to
IPL’s rate recovery mechanisms for fuel-related costs, changes in fuel-related
costs resulted in comparable changes in electric revenues and, therefore, did
not have a significant impact on IPL’s electric margins.  WPL’s rate
recovery mechanism for wholesale fuel-related costs also provides for subsequent
adjustments to its wholesale electric rates for changes in commodity costs,
thereby mitigating impacts of changes to commodity costs on its electric
margins.

WPL’s
retail fuel-related costs incurred in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were all lower than
the forecasted fuel-related costs used to set retail rates during such
periods.  WPL estimates the lower than forecasted retail fuel-related
costs increased electric margins by approximately $8 million, $5 million and $16
million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Refer to
“Other Matters - Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions” for discussion
of risks associated with increased electric production fuel and energy purchases
expenses on WPL’s electric margins.  Refer to “Rate Matters” and Note
1(h)

of
Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information relating to recovery mechanisms for electric production fuel and
energy purchases expenses including proposed changes to the retail rate recovery
mechanism in Wisconsin for such expenses.

Alliant
Energy’s electric sales demand is seasonal to some extent with the annual peak
normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning usage by its
residential and commercial customers.  Cooling degree days (CDD) data
is used to measure the variability of temperatures during summer months and is
correlated with electric sales demand.  Heating degree days (HDD) data
is used to measure the variability of temperatures during winter months and is
correlated with electric and gas sales demand.  Refer to “Utility Gas
Margins - Impacts of Weather Conditions” for details regarding HDD in Alliant
Energy’s service territories.  CDD in Alliant Energy’s service

Alliant
Energy periodically utilizes weather derivatives based on CDD and HDD to reduce
the potential volatility on its margins during the summer months of June through
August and the winter months of November through March,
respectively.  Alliant Energy entered into weather derivatives based
on CDD in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Madison, Wisconsin for the periods June 1, 2008
to Aug. 31, 2008 and June 1, 2007 to Aug. 31, 2007.  Alliant Energy
did not enter into any weather derivatives for the June 1, 2009 to Aug. 31, 2009
time period.  Alliant Energy entered into weather derivatives based on
HDD in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Madison, Wisconsin for the periods Nov. 1, 2008 to
March 31, 2009 and Nov. 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008 and weather derivatives based
on HDD in Chicago, Illinois for the periods Nov. 1, 2006 to March 31,
2007.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy did not enter into any
weather derivatives for the Nov. 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010 time
period.

Unbilled
Revenue Estimates -

In the second quarter of each year, when weather
impacts on electric sales volumes are historically minimal, Alliant Energy
refines its estimates of unbilled electric revenues.  Adjustments
resulting from these refined estimates can increase (e.g. 2008) or decrease
(e.g. 2009 and 2007) electric margins reported in the second
quarter.  Estimated increases (decreases) in Alliant Energy’s electric
margins from the annual adjustments to unbilled revenue estimates recorded in
the second quarter were as follows (in millions):

Sales
Trends -

Retail sales volumes decreased 7% and 1% in 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  The 2009 decrease was largely due to a 12% decrease in
industrial sales, which was caused by reduced sales to two of IPL’s larger
industrial customers who transitioned to their own cogeneration facilities in
2009 and plant closures and shift reductions as a result of economic conditions
in 2009.  Retail sales volumes in 2008 were impacted by temporary
disruptions of electric service associated with severe flooding in
2008.  At the peak of the disruptions caused by the severe weather,
approximately 40,000 electric customers of IPL were unable to receive
service.  The most significant impacts of these disruptions on
electric sales related to several large industrial customers in Cedar Rapids,
Iowa who were unable to receive service after the flood.

Wholesale
sales volumes decreased 15% and increased 7% in 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  The 2009 decrease was largely due to the impact of
weather and economic conditions in 2009 on the electric sales demand of IPL’s
and WPL’s wholesale customers.  Wholesale and retail sales volumes in
2008 were impacted by IPL’s and WPL’s sales of their respective electric
distribution properties in Illinois in February 2007.  Prior to these
asset sales, electric revenues and MWhs sold to retail customers in Illinois
were included in residential, commercial and industrial sales in the electric
margin table above.  Upon completion of these asset sales, IPL and WPL
entered into separate wholesale agreements to continue to provide electric
service to their former retail customers in Illinois.  Electric
revenues and MWhs sold under these wholesale agreements are included in
wholesale sales in the electric margin table above.  The lower pricing
for wholesale customers as compared to retail customers resulted in a decrease
to electric margins following the sale of the electric distribution properties
in Illinois.


Bulk
power and other revenue changes were largely due to changes in revenues from
sales in the wholesale energy market operated by the Midwest Independent
Transmission System Operator (MISO) and PJM Interconnection,
LLC.  These changes are impacted by several factors including the
availability of Alliant Energy’s generating facilities and electricity demand
within these wholesale energy markets.  Changes in bulk power and
other sales revenues were largely offset by changes in energy purchases expense
and therefore did not have a significant impact on electric
margins.

Refer to
“Other Matters - Other Future Considerations” for discussion of retail electric
sales projections expected to be influenced by economic conditions, new
cogeneration facilities constructed by two of IPL’s industrial customers and
ethanol production facilities in Alliant Energy’s service
territories.

Utility
Gas Margins

-

Gas margins are defined as gas operating revenues less cost of gas
sold.  Management believes that gas margins provide a more meaningful
basis for evaluating utility operations than gas operating revenues since cost
of gas sold are generally passed through to customers, and therefore, result in
changes to gas operating revenues that are comparable to changes in cost of gas
sold.  Gas margins and dekatherm (Dth) sales for Alliant Energy were
as follows:

vs. 2008 Summary -

Gas margins decreased $13 million, or 7%, in 2009,
primarily due to an estimated $7 million reduction in gas margins from changes
in the net impacts of weather conditions and Alliant Energy’s weather hedging
activities, and the impact of WPL’s 2009 retail gas rate decrease effective in
January 2009 that reduced WPL’s gas revenues in 2009 by $4 million.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Gas margins increased $2 million, or 1%, in 2008,
primarily due to an estimated $11 million increase in gas margins from changes
in the net impacts of weather conditions and Alliant Energy’s weather hedging
activities.  This item was partially offset by $5 million of gains in
2007 from WPL’s performance-based gas commodity cost recovery program (benefits
were allocated between ratepayers and WPL) and a decrease in weather-normalized
retail residential sales largely due to the negative impacts high natural gas
prices and the slowing economy in 2008 had on customer demand during such
period.

Natural
Gas Cost Recoveries -

In 2009 and 2008, Alliant Energy’s cost of gas sold
decreased $172 million, or 33%, and increased $79 million, or 18%,
respectively.  The 2009 decrease was primarily due to a decrease in
Dths sold to retail customers and a decrease in natural gas
prices.  The 2008 increase was primarily due to an increase in natural
gas prices and an increase in Dths sold to retail customers.  Due to
Alliant Energy’s rate recovery mechanisms for natural gas costs, these changes
in cost of gas sold resulted in comparable changes in gas revenues and,
therefore, did not have a significant impact on gas margins.  Refer to
Note 1(h)

of
Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information relating to natural gas cost recoveries.

Impacts

Alliant
Energy periodically utilizes weather derivatives based on HDD to reduce the
potential volatility on its gas margins during the winter months of November
through March.

Performance-based
Gas Commodity Recovery Program -

In 2007, 35% of all gains and losses
from WPL’s gas performance incentive sharing mechanism were retained by WPL,
with 65% refunded to or recovered from customers.  Effective Nov. 1,
2007, WPL’s gas performance incentive sharing mechanism was terminated and
replaced with a modified one-for-one pass through of gas costs.  WPL’s
performance-based gas commodity recovery program resulted in gains which
increased gas margins by $5 million in 2007.  Refer to Note 1(h) of
Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
details of the gas commodity recovery program implemented in November
2007.

Refer to
“Rate Matters” for discussion of various electric and gas rate filings including
anticipated rate filings in 2010.

Utility
Other Revenues

-
Changes in utility other revenues were largely offset by related changes in
utility other operation and maintenance expenses.

vs. 2008 Summary -

Other revenues for the utilities decreased $9 million
in 2009, primarily due to $5 million of lower steam revenues at
IPL.  IPL’s steam revenues were higher than normal during the second
half of 2008 due to higher rates charged to steam customers for operating the
temporary steam generating systems (natural gas-fired package boilers and water
treatment systems) used to resume steam service after its Prairie Creek and
Sixth Street Generating Stations were shut down due to severe flooding
in  2008.  In the second quarter of 2009, IPL announced its
decision to discontinue providing steam service within the next 12 months to the
portion of its steam customers located in downtown Cedar Rapids,
Iowa.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Other revenues for the utilities increased $30 million
in 2008, primarily due to higher steam revenues at IPL and $7 million of higher
coal sales by IPL in 2008.  IPL’s steam revenues increased $20 million
largely due to the recovery of incremental leasing and fuel costs incurred to
resume steam production and service in Cedar Rapids, Iowa after its Prairie
Creek and Sixth Street Generating Stations were shut down due to the severe
flooding that occurred in 2008.

Non-regulated

RMT

$


$


$


Transportation




Non-regulated
      Generation

--


$


$


$


vs. 2008 Summary

- The decreased RMT revenues were primarily caused by
reduced demand for construction management services for large wind generation
projects in 2009.  These decreases in revenues were largely offset by
lower costs incurred by RMT to manage large wind generation projects, which are
included in non-regulated operation and maintenance expenses.  The
demand for services from RMT’s WindConnect® business is impacted by various
external factors, including the availability and amount of government incentives
for wind projects, the number and scope of state-imposed renewable portfolio
standards and the availability and cost of capital to fund capital expenditures
for wind projects.  The ARRA enacted in February 2009 extended
incentives to wind projects completed by Dec. 31, 2012.

The
decreased Non-regulated Generation revenues were primarily due to $9 million of
lower revenues generated by the Neenah Energy Facility as a result of the sale
of the facility to WPL on June 1, 2009 and $6 million of revenues generated from
demand for temporary generation projects during 2008 as a result of the flooding
in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in 2008.


vs. 2007 Summary

- The increased RMT revenues were primarily due to
higher revenues earned by its WindConnect® business on large construction
management projects related to wind projects.  These increased
revenues were largely offset by increased costs incurred by RMT for the large
construction management projects included in non-regulated operation and
maintenance expenses.

The
decreased Non-regulated Generation revenues were primarily due to $8 million of
lower revenues generated by the Neenah Energy Facility due to a change in PPAs
effective June 1, 2008.  This item was partially offset by $6 million
of revenues generated from demand for temporary generation projects in 2008 as a
result of the flooding in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in 2008.  The $6 million
of increased revenues from the temporary generation projects were offset by a
comparable increase in costs included in non-regulated operation and maintenance
expenses.

Electric
Transmission Service Expenses

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Alliant Energy’s electric transmission service expense
for the utilities increased $43 million in 2009, primarily due to $45 million of
higher expenses billed to IPL from ITC in 2009, resulting from increased rates
effective in January 2009.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Alliant Energy’s electric transmission service
expenses for the utilities increased $89 million in 2008, primarily due to $77
million of charges at IPL incurred in 2008 for transmission services provided by
ITC following the sale of IPL’s electric transmission assets to ITC in December
2007 and $12 million of increased electric transmission services at WPL
primarily due to increased electric transmission rates billed to WPL by
ATC.  The electric transmission-related charges from ITC were
partially offset by electric transmission-related operating expenses incurred in
2007 including operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization
expenses and taxes other than income taxes, as well as the positive impacts on
earnings from the application of the sale proceeds

Refer to
“Other Matters - Other Future Considerations” for discussion of material
increases in electric transmission service expenses at IPL anticipated in 2010
resulting from increased transmission rates proposed by ITC.  Refer to
Notes 1(b) and 1(h)

of

information relating to recovery of electric transmission service
expenses.

Refer to
“Other Matters - Other Future Considerations” for discussion of anticipated
material decreases in pension and other postretirement benefits expenses in 2010
resulting from increases in retirement plans’ assets during 2009 and anticipated
increases in maintenance expenses in 2010 for IPL’s Whispering Willow - East
wind project.

Non-regulated
Operation and Maintenance Expenses

-
Alliant Energy’s non-regulated operation and maintenance expenses were as
follows (in millions):




RMT

$


$


Transportation




Non-regulated
      Generation




Other (includes
      eliminations)


(2

)


$


$


$


vs. 2008 Summary -

The RMT variance was largely driven by lower
construction management costs associated with the execution of large wind
projects in 2009 and lower incentive-related compensation expenses of $8 million
in 2009 resulting from the lower earnings at RMT.  The Non-regulated
Generation variance was largely driven by $6 million of project costs incurred
in 2008 associated with temporary generation projects.  The increased
Other expenses were largely due to higher professional expenses incurred at the
parent company in 2009.

vs. 2007 Summary -

The RMT variance was largely driven by higher project
costs associated with the execution of large construction management
projects.  The Non-regulated Generation variance was largely driven by
$6 million of project costs incurred in 2008 associated with temporary
generation projects.  The Other expenses variance was primarily due to
lower incentive-related compensation expenses and increased eliminations of
intercompany operating expenses.

Depreciation
and Amortization Expenses

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $34
million primarily due to additional depreciation expense from the impact of
property additions at IPL related to restoration activities associated with the
severe flooding and the Whispering Willow - East wind project that began
commercial operation in late 2009 and property additions at WPL related to its
Cedar Ridge wind project that began commercial operation in late 2008, AMI
placed into service in 2009 and the June 2009 acquisition of the Neenah Energy
Facility.  The increases were also impacted by higher depreciation
rates at IPL.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $21
million primarily due to $16 million of depreciation expense in 2007 related to
IPL’s electric transmission assets that were sold in December 2007, a $9 million
decrease from the implementation of lower depreciation rates at WPL in 2008 as a
result of a new depreciation study and lower amortization expenses from
enterprise resource planning (ERP) software that became fully amortized in
2007.  These items were partially offset by additional depreciation
expense from the impact of utility property additions including WPL’s Cedar
Ridge wind project that began commercial operation in late 2008.

Taxes
other than Income Taxes

-

vs. 2007 Summary -

Taxes other than income taxes decreased $6 million in
2008, primarily due to $6 million of property tax expense in 2007 related to
IPL’s electric transmission assets that were sold in December 2007.

Refer to
“Rate Matters” for discussion of the interplay between utility operating
expenses and utility margins given their impact on Alliant Energy’s rate
activities.

Gain
on Sale of IPL’s Electric Transmission Assets

- The sale of IPL’s
electric transmission assets in December 2007 resulted in a pre-tax gain of $219
million in 2007.  The gain reflected the net proceeds from the sale
less the net assets sold and a regulatory liability established pursuant to an
IUB order.  Refer to Note 22 of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional details of the sale of IPL’s
electric transmission assets.

Equity
Income from Unconsolidated Investments

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Equity income from unconsolidated investments
increased $3 million in 2009, primarily due to $4 million of higher equity
income from ATC largely due to the impacts of increased transmission rates
billed by ATC.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Equity income from unconsolidated investments
increased $4 million in 2008, primarily due to $5 million of higher equity
income from ATC largely due to the impacts of increased transmission rates
billed by ATC.

Refer to
Note 9(a) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
breakdown of Alliant Energy’s equity income from unconsolidated
investments.

AFUDC

- -

vs. 2008 Summary -

AFUDC increased $15 million in 2009, primarily due to
$14 million of higher AFUDC recognized in 2009 as compared to 2008 for IPL’s
Whispering Willow - East wind project.  The increase was also due to
AFUDC recognized in 2009 on capital projects related to restoration activities
at IPL associated with the severe flooding in 2008 and WPL’s Bent Tree - Phase I
wind project.  These items were partially offset by AFUDC recognized
in 2008 related to the construction of WPL’s Cedar Ridge wind
project.


vs. 2007 Summary -

AFUDC increased $17 million in 2008, primarily due to
AFUDC recognized in 2008 related to the construction of WPL’s Cedar Ridge wind
project and IPL’s Whispering Willow - East wind project.

Interest
Income and Other

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Interest income and other decreased $14 million in
2009, primarily due to $15 million of lower interest income caused by lower
average balances of cash and cash equivalents and lower interest rates on money
market fund investments in 2009 compared to 2008.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Interest income and other increased $3 million in
2008, primarily due to $7 million of increased interest income caused by higher
average balances of cash and cash equivalents in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a
result of proceeds received from the sale of IPL’s electric transmission assets
in December 2007.  This item was partially offset by a $4 million
pre-tax gain realized from the sale of an investment in 2007.

Refer to
Notes 1(d) and 1(l) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for additional information regarding Alliant Energy’s cash and cash
equivalents and interest income and other, respectively.

Income
Taxes

-

The effective income tax rates for Alliant Energy’s continuing operations
were (7.7%), 31.9% and 36.6% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

vs. 2008 Summary -

The decrease in the effective income tax rate was
primarily due to $40 million of income tax benefits recognized in 2009 related
to the net impacts of SB 62 enacted in February 2009 and a decision by
management to allow WPL to do business in Iowa in order to take advantage of
efficiencies that will likely be available as a result of IPL and WPL sharing
resources and facilities and $4 million of production tax credits in 2009 from
the Cedar Ridge wind project that began commercial operation in late
2008.  These items were partially offset by $12 million of income tax
benefits recorded in 2008 as a result of finalizing the audit of Alliant
Energy’s U.S. federal income tax returns for calendar years 2002 through 2004
and recording known adjustments for the tax returns for calendar years 2005
through 2007.

vs. 2007 Summary -

The decrease in the effective income tax rate was
primarily due to the impact of income tax expense related to the gain on sale of
IPL’s electric transmission assets in 2007, $12 million of income tax benefits
recorded in 2008 related to the impact of reaching a settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2008 regarding the audit of Alliant Energy’s
U.S. federal income tax returns for calendar years 2002 through 2004 and
recording known adjustments for the tax returns for calendar years 2005 through
2007, and other changes in the impacts of property related differences for which
deferred tax expense is not recorded pursuant to Iowa rate making
principles.  These items were partially offset by a $6 million
reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in 2007 related to changes
in Alliant Energy’s anticipated ability to utilize capital losses prior to their
expiration, $4 million of income tax benefits recorded in 2007 as a result of
reaching a settlement with the IRS in 2007 regarding the audits of Alliant
Energy’s U.S. federal income tax returns for calendar years 1999 through 2001
and recording known adjustments for the tax returns for calendar years 2002
through 2006, deferred tax rate changes as a result of estimated higher state
income tax rates from apportionment changes anticipated in the future, a reserve
recorded at WPL in 2008 for a tax-related regulatory asset and lower
manufacturing production deductions in 2008.

Refer to
Note 5

of
Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information regarding its effective income tax rates.  Refer to “Other
Matters - Other Future Considerations” for discussion of production tax credits
for wind projects, which may impact future effective income tax
rates.

IPL’S RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS

Overview

- -

Earnings available for common stock increased $11 million in 2009 and
decreased $149 million in 2008.  The 2009 increase was primarily due
to a lower effective income tax rate, the impact of the severe flooding on
electric margins and operating expenses in 2008 and the impact of the interim
rate increase implemented in March 2009.  These items were partially
offset by lower electric sales resulting from cool summer weather and economic
conditions in 2009 and higher operating expenses.  The 2008 decrease
was primarily due to an after-tax gain of $123 million from the sale of IPL’s
electric transmission assets in 2007 and lower electric margins and higher
operating expenses caused by the severe flooding in 2008.

Electric
Margins

-

Electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less electric
production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric capacity
expenses.  Management believes that electric margins provide a more
meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating
revenues since electric production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric
capacity expenses are generally passed through to customers, and therefore,
result in changes to electric operating revenues that are comparable to changes
in electric production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric capacity
expenses.  Electric margins and MWh sales for IPL were as

vs. 2008 Summary -

Electric margins increased $30 million, or 4%, in
2009, primarily due to the impact of IPL’s 2009 interim retail rate increase
effective in March 2009, which increased IPL’s electric revenues by $62 million
in 2009, an estimated $10 million reduction in electric margins in 2008 from the
loss of retail sales during electric service outages caused by the severe
flooding in IPL’s service territory in 2008, $6 million of incremental purchased
electric capacity expenses in 2008 resulting from the severe flooding, $5
million of higher energy conservation revenues and a $4 million
regulatory-related credit recorded by IPL in 2009 related to IUB approval to
recover electric capacity expenses incurred in 2008 related to the severe
flooding.  These items were partially offset by an estimated $21
million reduction in electric margins from changes in the net impacts of weather
conditions and IPL’s weather hedging activities, a decrease in
weather-normalized sales volumes, a $9 million reduction in electric margins
from the impact of IPL’s annual adjustments to unbilled revenue estimates and $6
million of higher purchased electric capacity expenses related to the DAEC
PPA.  The decrease in weather-normalized retail sales volumes was
largely due to a 12% decrease in industrial sales caused by reduced sales to two
of IPL’s larger industrial customers who transitioned to their own cogeneration
facilities in 2009 and plant closures and shift reductions as a result of
economic conditions in 2009.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Electric margins decreased $24 million, or 3%, in
2008, primarily due to $12 million of lower wheeling revenues resulting from the
sale of electric transmission assets in December 2007, an estimated $10 million
reduction in electric margins during 2008 due to the loss of retail sales during
electric service outages caused by the severe flooding in IPL’s service
territory in 2008, an estimated $8 million reduction in electric margins from
changes in the net impacts of weather conditions and IPL’s weather hedging
activities and $6 million of incremental purchased electric capacity expenses in
2008 resulting from the severe flooding.  These items were partially
offset by a $5 million impact from changes in IPL’s annual adjustments to
unbilled revenue estimates, the loss of retail sales during electric service
outages caused by the winter storms in 2007 and an increase in
weather-normalized sales partially due to the impacts of increased industrial
sales to ethanol production facilities in IPL’s service territory.

Impacts

transactions.  Refer to “Other Matters - Other Future Considerations”
for discussion of electric sales projections expected to be influenced by
economic conditions, new cogeneration facilities constructed by two of IPL’s
industrial customers and ethanol production facilities in IPL’s service
territory.


Gas
Margins

-

Gas margins are defined as gas operating revenues less cost of gas
sold.  Management believes that gas margins provide a more meaningful
basis for evaluating utility operations than gas operating revenues since cost
of gas sold are generally passed through to customers, and therefore, result in
changes to gas operating revenues that are comparable to changes in cost of gas
sold.  Gas margins and Dth sales for IPL were as follows:

primarily due to an estimated $5 million reduction in gas margins from the
changes in the net impacts of weather conditions and IPL’s weather hedging
activities.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Gas margins increased $6 million, or 6%, in 2008,
primarily due to an estimated $6 million increase in gas margins from changes in

“Rate Matters” for discussion of IPL’s electric rate filings including
anticipated rate filings in 2010.

Steam
and Other Revenues

-
Changes in steam and other revenues were largely offset by related changes in
other operation and maintenance expenses.

vs. 2008 Summary -

Steam and other revenues decreased $6 million in 2009,
primarily due to $5 million of lower steam revenues.  IPL’s steam
revenues were higher than normal during the second half of 2008 due to higher
rates charged to steam customers for operating the temporary steam generating
systems used to resume steam service after its Prairie Creek and Sixth Street
Generating Stations were shut down due to severe flooding
in  2008.  In the second quarter of 2009, IPL announced its
decision to discontinue providing steam service within the next 12 months to the
portion of its steam customers located in downtown Cedar Rapids,
Iowa.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Steam and other revenues increased $28 million in
2008, primarily due to higher steam revenues and $7 million of higher coal sales
in 2008.  IPL’s steam revenues increased $20 million in 2008, largely
due to the recovery of incremental leasing and fuel costs incurred to resume
steam production and service in Cedar Rapids, Iowa after its Prairie Creek and
Sixth Street Generating Stations were shut down due to the severe flooding that
occurred in 2008.


Electric
Transmission Service Expenses

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Electric transmission service expense increased $42
million in 2009, primarily due to $45 million of higher expenses billed from ITC
resulting from increased rates effective in January 2009.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Electric transmission service expense increased $77
million in 2008, primarily due to $77 million of charges incurred in 2008 for
transmission services provided by ITC following the sale of IPL’s electric
transmission assets to ITC in December 2007.  The electric
transmission-related charges from ITC were partially offset by electric
transmission-related operating expenses incurred in 2007 including operation and
maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses and taxes other
than income taxes, as well as the positive impacts on earnings from the
application of the sale proceeds.

Refer to
“Other Matters - Other Future Considerations” for discussion of material
increases in electric transmission service expenses anticipated in 2010
resulting from increased transmission rates by ITC.

Other
Operation and Maintenance Expenses

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased $23
million in 2009, primarily due to $29 million of incremental expenses incurred
in 2008 related to severe flooding, $10 million of lower electric generation
maintenance expenses caused by planned maintenance outages in 2008, $9 million
of lower steam fuel, operation and maintenance expenses, $4 million of
regulatory-related credits recorded in 2009 related to 2008 flood costs, $3
million of lower incentive-related compensation expenses and lower expenses
resulting from cost saving initiatives implemented in 2009.  These
items were partially offset by $18 million of higher pension and other
postretirement benefits costs, $7 million of incremental expenses incurred in
2009 related to the severe flooding that occurred in 2008, $5 million of higher
energy conservation expenses, $4 million of restructuring charges incurred in
2009 related to the elimination of certain corporate and operations positions, a
$4 million asset impairment charge recorded in 2009 for the steam assets used to
serve steam customers in downtown Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a $4 million charge in
2009 related to a settlement with joint partners of the Sutherland #4 project
and a $2 million loss contingency reserve recorded in 2009 related to the
Alliant Energy Cash Balance Pension Plan lawsuit.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased $29
million in 2008, primarily due to $29 million of incremental expenses related to
the severe flooding in 2008 including operating expenditures required to restore
operations and impairments of assets impacted by the flooding that were not
reimbursed under IPL’s property insurance policy and $21 million of higher fuel
costs for steam production due to incremental fuel costs incurred to resume
steam production and service in Cedar Rapids, Iowa after its Prairie Creek and
Sixth Street Generating Stations were shut down.  The increase was
also due to $8 million of higher electric generation planned outage costs, $4
million of higher expenses related to coal sales, $3 million of higher employee
health care costs and $3 million of higher bad debt expenses due to economic
conditions.  These items were partially offset by $10 million of
electric transmission operating and maintenance expenses incurred in 2007 prior
to the sale of IPL’s electric transmission assets, $10 million of lower
incentive-related compensation expenses, $9 million of lower pension and other
postretirement benefits expenses, $9 million of incremental expenses associated
with winter storms in 2007 and $5 million of lower sales of accounts receivable
expenses.

Refer to
“Other Matters - Other Future Considerations” for discussion of anticipated
material decreases in pension and other postretirement benefits expenses in 2010
resulting from increases in retirement plans’ assets during 2009 and anticipated
increases in maintenance expenses in 2010 for IPL’s Whispering Willow - East
wind project.

Depreciation
and Amortization Expenses

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $22
million in 2009, primarily due to additional depreciation expense from the
impact of property additions and higher depreciation rates.  The
increased property additions were primarily related to restoration activities
associated with the severe flooding in 2008 and the IPL’s Whispering Willow -
East wind project that began commercial operation in late 2009.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $12
million in 2008, primarily due to $16 million of depreciation expense in 2007
related to IPL’s electric transmission assets that were sold in December 2007
and lower amortization expenses from ERP software that became fully amortized in
2007.  These items were partially offset by additional depreciation
expense from the impact of property additions.

Taxes
Other than Income Taxes

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Taxes other than income taxes decreased $4 million in
2009, primarily due to lower property tax expense.


vs. 2007 Summary -

Taxes other than income taxes decreased $7 million in
2008, primarily due to $6 million of property tax expense in 2007 related to
IPL’s electric transmission assets that were sold in December 2007.

Refer to
“Rate Matters” for discussion of the interplay between utility operating
expenses and utility margins given their impact on IPL’s utility rate
activities.

Gain
on Sale of IPL’s Electric Transmission Assets

- The sale of IPL’s
electric transmission assets in December 2007 resulted in a pre-tax gain of $219
million in 2007.  The gain reflected the net proceeds from the sale
less the net assets sold and a regulatory liability established pursuant to an
IUB order.  Refer to Note 22 of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional details of the sale of IPL’s
electric transmission assets.

Interest
Expense

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Interest expense increased $15 million in 2009,
primarily due to interest expense from IPL’s issuances of 7.25% senior
debentures in October 2008 and 6.25% senior debentures in July
2009.  These items were partially offset by the impact of IPL’s 6.625%
senior debentures retired in August 2009 and the impact of lower interest rates
on commercial paper borrowings in 2009 compared to 2008.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Interest expense decreased $2 million in 2008,
primarily due to long-term debt retirements in 2007 and lower average short-term
debt outstanding during 2008.  These items were partially offset by
the impact of IPL’s 7.25% senior debentures issued in October
2008.  The lower average short-term debt outstanding during 2008 was
primarily due to IPL using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its
electric transmission assets to reduce short-term debt in December
2007.

Refer to
Note 8(b) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
discussion of IPL’s long-term debt issuances and retirements.

AFUDC

- -

vs. 2008 Summary -

AFUDC increased $19 million in 2009, primarily due to
$14 million of higher AFUDC recognized in 2009 for IPL’s Whispering Willow -
East wind project.  The increase was also due to AFUDC recognized in
2009 on capital projects related to restoration activities associated with the
severe flooding in 2008.

vs. 2007 Summary -

AFUDC increased $10 million in 2008, primarily due to
AFUDC recognized in 2008 related to the construction of the Whispering Willow -
East wind project.

Income
Taxes

-

The effective income tax rates were 15.0%, 27.1% and 39.2% in 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively.

vs. 2008 Summary -

The decrease in the effective income tax rate was
primarily due to $33 million of income tax benefits recognized in 2009 related
to the net impacts of SB 62 enacted in February 2009 and a decision by
management to allow WPL to do business in Iowa in order to take advantage of
efficiencies that will likely be available as a result of IPL and WPL sharing
resources and facilities.  These items were partially offset by $13
million of income tax benefits recorded in 2008 as a result of finalizing the
audit of Alliant Energy’s U.S. federal income tax returns for calendar years
2002 through 2004 and recording known adjustments for the tax returns for
calendar years 2005 through 2007, and the impacts of property related
differences for which deferred tax expense is not recorded pursuant to Iowa rate
making principles.

vs. 2007 Summary -

The decrease in IPL’s effective tax rate was primarily
due to the impact of income tax expense related to the gain on sale of IPL’s
electric transmission assets in 2007, $13 million of income tax benefits
recorded in 2008 related to the impact of reaching a settlement with the IRS in
2008 regarding the audit of Alliant Energy’s U.S. federal income tax returns for
calendar years 2002 through 2004 and recording known adjustments for the tax
returns for calendar years 2005 through 2007, and other changes in the impacts
of property related differences for which deferred tax expense is not recorded
pursuant to Iowa rate making principles.  These items were partially
offset by $3 million of income tax benefits recorded in 2007 related to the
impact of reaching a settlement with the IRS in 2007 regarding the audit of
Alliant Energy’s U.S. federal income tax returns for calendar years 1999 through
2001 and recording known adjustments for tax returns for the calendar years 2002
through 2006, reserves recorded in 2008 related to uncertain tax positions and
related interest, deferred tax rate changes as a result of estimated higher
state income tax rates from apportionment changes anticipated in the future and
lower manufacturing production deductions in 2008.

Refer to
Note 5 of IPL’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information regarding changes in its effective income tax
rates.  Refer to “Other Matters - Other Future Considerations” for
discussion of production tax credits for a wind project, which may impact future
effective income tax rates.


WPL’S RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS

Overview

-

WPL’s earnings available for common stock decreased $29 million in 2009
and increased $5 million in 2008.  The 2009 decrease was primarily due
to lower electric sales resulting from cool summer weather and adverse economic
conditions in 2009, higher depreciation expense from its Cedar Ridge wind
project and the acquisition of the Neenah Energy Facility, and higher interest
expense from the issuances of new debentures.  The 2008 increase was
primarily due to lower purchased electric capacity expenses and higher AFUDC
related to the construction of WPL’s Cedar Ridge wind project.  These
items were partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from the
issuance of new debentures and gains in 2007 from WPL’s performance-based gas
commodity cost recovery program.

Electric
Margins

-

Electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less electric
production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric capacity
expenses.  Management believes that electric margins provide a more
meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating
revenues since electric production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric
capacity expenses are generally passed through to customers, and therefore
result in changes to electric operating revenues that are comparable to changes
in electric production fuel, energy purchases and purchased electric capacity
expenses.  Electric margins and MWh sales for WPL were as
follows:

vs. 2008 Summary -

Electric margins decreased $9 million, or 2%, in 2009,
primarily due to an estimated $12 million reduction in electric margins from
changes in the net impacts of weather conditions and WPL’s weather hedging
activities, $12 million of higher purchased electric capacity expenses related
to the Kewaunee PPA and a decrease in weather-normalized sales
volumes.  The decrease in weather-normalized retail sales volumes was
largely due to a 13% decrease in industrial sales caused by plant closures and
shift reductions as a result of economic conditions in 2009.  These
items were partially offset by $9 million of lower purchased electric capacity
expenses related to the RockGen PPA, which terminated in May 2009, a $5 million
increase in electric margins from the impact of WPL’s annual adjustments to
unbilled revenue estimates and a $3 million increase in electric margins from
the impact of changes in the recovery of electric production fuel and energy
purchases expense.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Electric margins increased $17 million, or 3%, in
2008, primarily due to $16 million of purchased electric capacity expenses in
2007 related to a contract that ended in December 2007, $8 million of lower
purchased electric capacity expenses in 2008 from the Kewaunee PPA and a $4
million impact from changes in WPL’s annual adjustments to unbilled revenue
estimates.  These items were partially offset by an $11 million
reduction in electric margins from the impact of changes in electric production
fuel and energy purchases cost recoveries and lower industrial sales volumes due
to the negative impact the slowing economy in 2008 had on WPL’s large industrial
customer demand during such period.

Impacts

electric distribution properties in February 2007 and wholesale energy market
transactions.  Refer to “Other Matters - Other Future Considerations”
for discussion of electric sales projections influenced by economic
conditions.

Gas
Margins

-

Gas margins are defined as gas operating revenues less cost of gas
sold.  Management believes that gas margins provide a more meaningful
basis for evaluating utility operations than gas operating revenues since cost
of gas sold are generally passed through to customers, and therefore, result in
changes to gas operating revenues that are comparable to changes in cost of gas
sold.  Gas margins and Dth sales for WPL were as follows:

vs. 2008 Summary -

Gas margins decreased $8 million, or 9%, in 2009,
primarily due to the impact of the 2009 retail gas rate decrease effective in
January 2009, which reduced gas revenues in 2009 by $4 million and an estimated
$2 million reduction in gas margins from changes in the net impacts of weather
conditions and WPL’s weather hedging activities.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Gas margins decreased $4 million, or 5% in 2008,
primarily due to $5 million of gains in 2007 from WPL’s performance-based gas
commodity cost recovery program (benefits were allocated between ratepayers and
WPL) and a decrease in weather-normalized retail residential sales largely due
to the negative impacts high natural gas prices and the slowing economy in 2008
had on customer demand during such period.  These items were partially
offset by an estimated $5 million increase in gas margins from changes in the
net impacts of weather conditions and WPL’s weather hedging
activities.

“Rate Matters” for discussion of WPL’s electric and gas rate filings including
an anticipated rate filing in 2010.


Electric
Transmission Service Expenses

-

vs. 2007 Summary -

Electric transmission service expenses increased $12
million in 2008, largely due to increased transmission rates billed to WPL by
ATC.

Other
Operation and Maintenance Expenses

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased $2
million in 2009, primarily due to $11 million of regulatory-related charges in
2009 related to the Nelson Dewey #3 project, $7 million of restructuring charges
incurred in 2009 related to the elimination of certain corporate and operations
positions and a $2 million loss contingency reserve recorded in 2009 related to
the Alliant Energy Cash Balance Pension Plan lawsuit.  These items
were substantially offset by $4 million of regulatory-related charges in 2008
related to the Nelson Dewey #3 project, $3 million of lower incentive-related
compensation expenses and the impact of cost saving initiatives implemented by
WPL in 2009.  Pension and other postretirement benefit costs, net of
the portion allocated to capital projects, increased $15 million primarily due
to the amortization of actuarial losses and lower expected return on plan assets
caused by significant decreases in plan assets in 2008.  These higher
net pension costs were offset by a deferral of retail pension and benefits costs
recorded in accordance with the stipulation agreement approved by the PSCW
related to WPL’s 2009 retail rate case.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased $4
million in 2008, primarily due to $7 million of lower pension and other
postretirement benefits expenses, $7 million of lower incentive-related
compensation expenses and a $4 million regulatory-related charge in
2007.  These items were partially offset by $5 million of higher
employee health care costs, a $4 million regulatory-related charge in 2008, $3
million of lower regulatory liability amortizations and $1 million of higher bad
debt expenses primarily due to economic conditions.

Refer to
“Other Matters - Other Future Considerations” for discussion of anticipated
material decreases in pension and other postretirement benefits expenses in 2010
resulting from increases in retirement plans’ assets during 2009.

Depreciation
and Amortization Expenses

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $14
million in 2009, primarily due to the impact of property additions related to
WPL’s Cedar Ridge wind project that began commercial operation in late 2008, AMI
placed into service in 2009 and the June 2009 acquisition of the Neenah Energy
Facility.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $8
million in 2008, primarily due to a $9 million decrease from the implementation
of lower depreciation rates in 2008 as a result of a new depreciation study and
lower amortization expenses from ERP software that became fully amortized in
2007.  These items were partially offset by additional depreciation
expense from the impact of utility property additions including WPL’s Cedar
Ridge wind project that began commercial operation in late 2008.

Refer to
“Rate Matters” for discussion of the interplay between utility operating
expenses and utility margins given their impact on WPL’s utility rate
activities.

Interest
Expense

-

vs. 2008 Summary -

Interest expense increased $13 million in 2009,
primarily due to interest expense from WPL’s issuances of 7.6% debentures in
October 2008 and 5% debentures in July 2009.  These items were
partially offset by the impact of WPL’s 5.7% debentures retired in October 2008
and lower commercial paper outstanding balances and interest rates in 2009
compared to 2008.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Interest expense increased $13 million in 2008,
primarily due to higher interest expense from WPL’s 6.375% debentures issued in
August 2007 and 7.6% debentures issued in October 2008.  These items
were partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of WPL’s 7%
debentures retired in June 2007 and 5.7% debentures retired in October
2008.

Refer to
Note 8(b) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidating Financial Statements” for
details of WPL’s long-term debt issuances and retirements.

Equity
Income from Unconsolidated Investments

- -

vs. 2008 Summary -

Equity income from unconsolidated investments
increased $3 million in 2009, primarily due to $4 million of higher equity
income from ATC.

vs. 2007 Summary -

Equity income from unconsolidated investments
increased $6 million in 2008, primarily due to $5 million of higher equity
income from ATC.


AFUDC

- -

vs. 2008 Summary -

AFUDC decreased $4 million in 2009, primarily due to
AFUDC recognized in 2008 related to the construction of WPL’s Cedar Ridge wind
project, partially offset by AFUDC recognized in 2009 related to the
construction of WPL’s Bent Tree - Phase I wind project.

vs. 2007 Summary -

AFUDC increased $7 million in 2008, primarily due to
AFUDC recognized in 2008 related to the construction of WPL’s Cedar Ridge wind
project.

Income
Taxes

-

The effective income tax rates were 33.9%, 36.6% and 34.3% in 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively.

vs. 2008 Summary -

The decrease in the effective income tax rate for 2009
was primarily due to $4 million of production tax credits in 2009 from the Cedar
Ridge wind project that began commercial operation in December 2008 and $2
million of income tax benefits recognized in 2009 related to the net impacts of
the SB 62 enacted in February 2009 and a decision by management to allow WPL to
do business in Iowa thus requiring WPL to file as part of the Iowa consolidated
tax return.

vs. 2007 Summary -

The increase in the effective tax rate for 2008 was
primarily due to a reserve recorded in 2008 for a tax-related regulatory asset
and deferred tax rate changes as a result of estimated higher state income tax
rates from apportionment changes anticipated in the future.

Refer to
Note 5 of WPL’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information regarding changes in its effective income tax
rates.  Refer to “Other Matters - Other Future Considerations” for
discussion of production tax credits for wind projects, which may impact future
effective income tax rates.

LIQUIDITY

AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

- -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they have, and expect to maintain,
an adequate liquidity position to operate their businesses as a result of
available capacity under their revolving credit facilities, operating cash flows
generated by their utility business, and available cash and cash
equivalents.  Based on their liquidity positions and capital
structures, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they will be able to secure the
additional capital required to implement their strategic plans and to meet their
long-term contractual obligations.  Access by Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL to capital markets to fund their future capital requirements is largely
dependent on their respective credit quality and on developments in those
capital markets.

Liquidity
Position

- At Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy and its subsidiaries had $175
million of cash and cash equivalents and $433 million ($97 million at IPL, $240
million at WPL and $96 million at the parent company) of available capacity
under their revolving credit facilities.  Refer to “Cash Flows -
Financing Activities - Short-term Debt” for further discussion of the credit
facilities.  Refer to Note 1(d) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on Alliant
Energy’s cash and cash equivalents.

Capital
Structure

- Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL plan to maintain consolidated
debt-to-total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment-grade
credit ratings in order to facilitate ongoing and reliable access to capital
markets on reasonable terms and conditions.  Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s
and WPL’s capital structures at Dec. 31, 2009 were as follows (dollars in
millions):

In
addition to capital structures, other important financial considerations used to
determine the characteristics of future financings include financial coverage
ratios, flexibility regarding the utility generation plans, state regulations
and the levels of debt imputed by rating agencies.  The most
significant debt imputations include a portion of the DAEC, Kewaunee and
Riverside PPAs and postretirement benefits obligations.  The PSCW
explicitly factors certain imputed debt adjustments in establishing a regulatory
capital structure as part of WPL’s retail rate cases, particularly those related
to operating leases and PPAs.  The IUB does not make any explicit
adjustments for imputed debt in establishing capital ratios used in determining
rates, although such adjustments are considered by IPL in recommending an equity
ratio.

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL intend to manage their respective capital structures in such
a way that they do not compromise their ability to raise the necessary funding
required to enable them to continue to provide utility services reliably and at
reasonable costs, while maintaining financial capital structure targets
consistent with those approved by regulators.  Key considerations
include maintaining access to the financial markets on the terms, in the amounts
and within the timeframes required to fund Alliant Energy’s strategic plan,
retaining a prudent level of financial flexibility and maintaining IPL’s and
WPL’s investment-grade credit ratings.  The capital structure is only
one of a number of components that needs to be actively managed in order to
achieve these objectives.  Both IPL and WPL currently expect to
maintain a capital structure in which total debt would not exceed 40% to 45%,
and preferred stock would not exceed 5% to 10%, of total
capital.  These targets may be adjusted depending on subsequent
developments and on their potential impact on IPL’s and WPL’s investment-grade
credit ratings.

Credit
and Capital Market Developments

-
Financial markets were subjected to considerable strain over the past two years,
resulting in adverse impacts on the availability and terms of credit for
businesses.  A number of initiatives have been taken by the U.S.
Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve System intended to contain the
contraction of credit in the economy and of liquidity in the various capital
markets.  These initiatives have resulted in a degree of
stabilization, which has varied across different sectors of the capital
markets.  Financial market conditions continue to remain highly
sensitive to the evolving economic outlook.  Liquidity in the various
markets has fluctuated unpredictably, as investment flows continue to alternate
between the safety of shorter-dated U.S. Treasury obligations and the higher
yields associated with investments in corporate and/or longer-dated
instruments.  Concerns regarding the U.S. dollar’s reserve currency
role, and the willingness of overseas investors to continue to buy and hold U.S.
Treasury obligations, have also impacted the capital markets.  The
uncertain profile and impact of prospective financial market re-regulation
contributes to the unsettled tone of the various market sectors.

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL are aware of the potential implications these credit and
capital market developments might have on their ability to raise the external
funding required for their respective operations and capital expenditure
plans.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL had already taken measures over
the past several years to improve their financial strengths including: reducing
financial leverage; retiring debt; securing multi-year committed revolving
credit facilities to provide backstop liquidity to their commercial paper
programs and a committed source of alternative liquidity in the event the
commercial paper market becomes disrupted; arranging an accounts receivable
sales program for up to $150 million at IPL as an alternative source of working
capital financing; retaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund a
portion of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s current operating and capital
requirements in the event of credit market disruptions; extending IPL’s and
WPL’s respective long-term debt maturity profiles and avoiding undue
concentrations of maturities over the next few years; and converting certain of
IPL’s and WPL’s pollution control revenue bonds from variable interest rates to
fixed interest rates.  As discussed below, IPL and WPL retain
flexibility in undertaking their capital expenditure programs, particularly with
respect to capital expenditures to fund the investment programs within their
strategic plans.

Primary
Sources and Uses of Cash

- -

Alliant Energy’s most significant source of cash is electric and gas
sales to its utility customers.  Cash from these sales reimburses IPL
and WPL for prudently incurred expenses to provide service to their utility
customers and provides IPL and WPL a return on the rate base assets required to
provide such services.  Utility operating cash flows are expected to
cover the majority of IPL’s and WPL’s capital expenditures required to maintain
their current infrastructure and dividends paid to Alliant Energy’s
shareowners.  Capital requirements needed to retire debt and fund
capital expenditures related to new generating facilities and environmental
compliance programs, are expected to be financed primarily through external
financings.  Ongoing monitoring of credit and capital market
conditions allows management to evaluate the availability of funding and the
terms and conditions attached to such financing.  In order to maintain
debt-to-total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment-grade
ratings, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL may periodically fund such capital
requirements with additional debt and equity.

Operating
Activities -

vs. 2008

- Alliant Energy’s cash flows from operating activities
increased $319 million primarily due to $272 million of higher cash flows from
changes in income tax payments and refunds, lower payments for prepaid gas and
gas stored underground partially due to lower natural gas prices, $73 million of
incremental operating expenditures in 2008 due to the severe flooding in IPL’s
service territory, $50 million of higher cash flows from changes in the level of
accounts receivable sold at IPL during 2009 and 2008, $32 million of higher cash
flows from changes in the amount of collateral paid to and received from
counterparties of derivative contracts during 2009 and 2008, $27 million of
insurance proceeds received by IPL in 2009 for operating expenditures related to
the severe flooding in 2008 and $16 million of refunds paid by WPL to retail
electric customers in 2008 related to over-recovered fuel-related costs in
2007.  These items were partially offset by $131 million of pension
plan contributions in 2009, $40 million of lower cash flows from operations at
RMT largely due to payments received in 2008 for a large wind construction
management project, $23 million of refunds paid by WPL to its retail customers
in 2009 for over-collected fuel-related costs during 2008, $18 million of
insurance proceeds received by IPL in 2008 for operating expenditures related to
severe flooding and the impact of lower electric sales at IPL and WPL due to
weather and economic conditions in 2009.

IPL’s
cash flows from operating activities increased $260 million primarily due to
$119 million of higher cash flows from changes in income tax payments and
refunds, $73 million of incremental operating expenditures in 2008 due to the
severe flooding in IPL’s service territory, lower payments for prepaid gas and
gas stored underground partially due to lower natural gas prices, $50 million of
higher cash flows from changes in the level of accounts receivable sold during
2009 and 2008 and $27 million of insurance proceeds received in 2009 for
operating expenditures related to the severe flooding in 2008.  These
items were partially offset by $59 million of pension plan contributions in
2009, $18 million of insurance proceeds received in 2008 for operating
expenditures related to severe flooding and the impact of lower electric sales
due to weather and economic conditions in 2009.

WPL’s
cash flows from operating activities increased $66 million primarily due to $107
million of higher cash flows from changes in income tax payments and refunds,
lower payments for gas stored underground partially due to lower natural gas
prices, $28 million of higher cash flows from changes in the amount of
collateral paid to and received from counterparties of derivative contracts
during 2009 and 2008 and $16 million of refunds paid by WPL to retail electric
customers in 2008 related to over-recovered fuel-related costs in
2007.  These items were partially offset by $47 million of pension
plan contributions in 2009, $23 million of refunds paid by WPL to its retail
customers in 2009 for over-collected fuel-related costs in 2008 and the impact
of lower electric sales due to weather and economic conditions in
2009.

vs. 2007

- Alliant Energy’s cash flows from operating activities
decreased $269 million primarily due to $77 million of transmission service
expenditures paid to ITC in 2008 following the sale of IPL’s electric
transmission assets in December 2007, $73 million of incremental operating
expenditures related to the severe flooding in 2008, $50 million of higher
expenditures due to changes in the level of accounts receivable sold during 2008
and 2007, $49 million of collateral payments received from counterparties of
derivative contracts in 2007, $23 million of expenditures by IPL for prepaid gas
in 2008, $16 million of refunds paid by WPL to retail electric customers in 2008
for over-recovered fuel-related costs in 2007 and other changes in working
capital.  These items were partially offset by $21 million of lower
income tax payments and $18 million of property insurance payments received by
IPL in 2008 for reimbursement of covered flood losses allocated to operating
expenditures.

IPL’s
cash flows from operating activities decreased $144 million primarily due to $77
million of transmission service expenditures paid to ITC in 2008 following the
sale of IPL’s electric transmission assets in December 2007, $73 million of
incremental operating expenditures related to the severe flooding in 2008, $50
million of higher expenditures due to changes in the level of accounts
receivable sold during 2008 and 2007, $27 million of collateral payments
received from counterparties of derivative contracts in 2007, $23 million of
expenditures for prepaid gas in 2008 and other changes in working
capital.  These items were partially offset by $126 million of lower
income tax payments and $18 million of property insurance payments received in
2008 for reimbursement of covered flood losses allocated to operating
expenditures.


WPL’s
cash flows from operating activities decreased $18 million primarily due to $22
million of collateral payments received from counterparties of derivative
contracts in 2007, $16 million of refunds paid to retail electric customers in
2008 for over-recovered fuel-related costs in 2007 and other changes in working
capital.  These items were partially offset by $32 million of lower
income tax payments.

Income
Tax Payments and Refunds

- Income tax payments and refunds resulted in
higher cash flows from operations for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL in 2009
compared to 2008.  These changes in income tax payments and refunds
were largely due to bonus tax depreciation deductions eligible to be taken by
Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL for 2009 under the ARRA and the impact of a change
in accounting method for repairs expenditures.  Refer to “Legislative
Matters” for additional discussion of the 2009 bonus tax depreciation deductions
under the ARRA and Note 5 of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for additional discussion of the change in tax method for repairs
expenditures.

IPL’s
Accounts Receivable Sale Program

- Changes in the levels of accounts
receivable sold by IPL decreased Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s cash flows from
operations by $25 million, $75 million and $25 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  The 2008 change was partially due to IPL using a
portion of the proceeds from the issuance of its senior debentures in October
2008 to reduce the amount of accounts receivable sold.  As of Dec. 31,
2009, IPL does not have any receivables sales outstanding under this
program.  However, IPL still plans to maintain the program as a
potential source of additional liquidity.  Refer to Note 4(a) of
Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information on IPL’s accounts receivable sale program, including new accounting
guidance that may impact the accounting for future sales of accounts
receivable.

Cash
Collateral

- Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have entered into various
commodity contracts that contain provisions requiring the parties to provide
cash collateral if their liability position under the contract exceeds certain
limitations.  Refer to Note 4(d) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on the cash
collateral outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008.  Refer to
“Legislative Matters” for proposed legislation that may impact the amount of
cash collateral required to be paid by Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL in the
future.

Pension
Plan Contributions

- In 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was
enacted.  This legislation included changes to minimum funding level
requirements of pension plans beginning in 2008.  In 2008, the Worker,
Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 was enacted.  This
legislation provides pension plan funding relief to retirement plan sponsors
impacted by material losses to their retirement plan assets in
2008.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently in compliance with
these two acts and expect to maintain compliance with these acts as a result of
future expected pension plan contributions noted below.  Pension plan
contributions for 2007 through 2009 along with estimates of pension plan
contributions currently expected to be made in 2010 through 2012 are as follows

Investing
Activities -

vs. 2008

- Alliant Energy’s cash flows used for investing activities
increased $283 million primarily due to $324 million of higher construction
expenditures including expenditures in 2009 for IPL’s and WPL’s wind projects,
restoration activities at IPL’s Prairie Creek Generating Station, AMI at WPL and
emission controls at IPL’s Lansing Unit 4.  This item was partially
offset by changes in the collection of and advances for customer energy
efficiency projects and higher insurance proceeds received by IPL in 2009
compared to 2008 for property damaged by the severe flooding in
2008.

IPL’s
cash flows used for investing activities increased $244 million primarily due to
$254 million of higher construction expenditures including expenditures in 2009
for its Whispering Willow - East wind project, restoration activities at its
Prairie Creek Generating Station and emission controls at its Lansing Unit
4.  This item was partially offset by higher insurance proceeds
received in 2009 compared to 2008 for property damaged by the severe flooding in
2008.


WPL’s
cash flows used for investing activities increased $117 million due to $145
million of higher construction and acquisition expenditures including
expenditures in 2009 for the Bent Tree - Phase I wind project, the Neenah Energy
Facility and AMI.  This item was partially offset by changes in the
collection of and advances for customer energy efficiency projects.

vs. 2007

- Alliant Energy’s cash flows used for investing activities
increased $1.2 billion primarily due to $901 million of net proceeds received
from asset sales in 2007 and $336 million of higher construction expenditures
including expenditures for IPL’s Whispering Willow - East and WPL’s Cedar Ridge
wind projects in 2008.  These items were partially offset by $24
million of expenditures for emission allowances at IPL in 2007.

IPL’s
cash flows used for investing activities increased $921 million primarily due to
$801 million of net proceeds from the sales of its electric transmission assets
and Illinois properties in 2007 and $164 million of higher construction
expenditures including expenditures for its Whispering Willow - East wind
project in 2008.  These items were partially offset by $24 million of
expenditures for emission allowances in 2007.

WPL’s
cash flows used for investing activities increased $169 million primarily due to
$160 million of higher construction expenditures including expenditures for its
Cedar Ridge wind project in 2008 and $24 million of net proceeds from the sale
of its Illinois properties in 2007.

Construction
and Acquisition Expenditures

- Capital expenditures and financing plans
are reviewed, approved and updated as part of Alliant Energy’s strategic
planning and budgeting processes.  In addition, significant capital
expenditures and investments are subject to a cross-functional review prior to
approval.  Changes in Alliant Energy’s anticipated construction and
acquisition expenditures may result from a number of reasons including economic
conditions, regulatory requirements, ability to obtain adequate and timely rate
relief, changing market conditions and new opportunities.  Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL currently anticipate construction and acquisition
expenditures during 2010 through 2012 as follows (in millions):

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL have not yet entered into contractual commitments relating
to the majority of their anticipated future capital expenditures.  As
a result, they have discretion with regard to the level of capital expenditures
eventually incurred and closely monitor and frequently update such estimates
based on numerous economic and other factors.  Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL have capital purchase obligations under a master supply agreement executed
in 2008 with Vestas for the purchase of wind turbine generator sets and related
equipment to support IPL’s and WPL’s wind generation plans.  Refer to
“Certain Financial Commitments - Contractual Obligations” for long-term capital
purchase obligations related to wind projects and “Strategic Overview” for
further discussion of the utility generation plans and environmental compliance
plans.

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL expect to finance their 2010 through 2012 capital
expenditure plans in a manner that allows them to adhere to the capital
structure targets discussed in the “Capital Structure” section
above.  2010 capital expenditures are expected to be funded with a
combination of available cash and cash equivalents, internally-generated cash,
and short- and long-term debt.  The precise characteristics of the
financing for the 2011 and 2012 capital expenditures will be determined closer
to the time that the financing is required.  Flexibility will be
required in implementing the long-term financing for capital expenditure plans
to allow for scheduling variations in the required authorization and
construction work, changing market conditions and any adjustments that might be
required to ensure there are no material adverse impacts to Alliant Energy’s,
IPL’s and WPL’s respective capital structures.


Proceeds

Financing
Activities -

vs. 2008

- Alliant Energy’s cash flows from financing activities
increased $191 million primarily due to changes in the amount of commercial
paper outstanding at IPL and changes in the amount of long-term debt issued and
retired during 2009 and 2008 discussed below.

IPL’s
cash flows from financing activities increased $12 million primarily due to
changes in the amount of commercial paper outstanding.  This item was
partially offset by changes in the amount of long-term debt issued and retired
during 2009 and 2008 discussed below and $50 million of lower capital
contributions from its parent company, Alliant Energy.

WPL’s
cash flows from financing activities increased $61 million primarily due to
changes in the amount of long-term debt issued and retired during 2009 and 2008
discussed below.

vs. 2007

- Alliant Energy’s cash flows from financing activities
increased $586 million primarily due to changes in the amount of long-term debt
issued and retired during 2008 and 2007 and $295 million of common stock
repurchases under Alliant Energy’s common stock repurchase program in
2007.  These items were partially offset by $34 million of proceeds
received from stock options exercised in 2007.

IPL’s
cash flows from financing activities increased $993 million primarily due to
$581 million of lower common stock dividends, changes in the amount of long-term
debt issued and retired during 2008 and 2007 and $100 million of higher capital
contributions from its parent, Alliant Energy.  These items were
partially offset by a $75 million repayment of capital to its parent, Alliant
Energy, in 2008.

WPL’s
cash flows from financing activities increased $193 million primarily due to
$100 million of lower common stock dividends and a $100 million capital
contribution from its parent, Alliant Energy, in 2008.  These items
were partially offset by changes in the amount of long-term debt issued and
retired during 2008 and 2007.

FERC
and Public Utility Holding Company Act Financing Authorizations

- Under
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, FERC has authority over the
issuance of utility securities, except to the extent that a state regulatory
commission has retained jurisdiction over such matters.  In 2008, FERC
issued an order allowing IPL to pay up to $400 million in common equity
distributions from additional paid-in capital, rather than retained
earnings.  In 2009 and 2008, IPL paid $106 million and $75 million,
respectively, of common equity distributions from additional paid-in capital
under this order.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, IPL had remaining authority
for $219 million of common equity distributions from additional paid-in capital,
rather than retained earnings, under the 2008 authorization issued by
FERC.

In
December 2009, FERC authorized IPL to issue up to $900 million of long-term debt
securities, $750 million of short-term debt securities and $200 million of
preferred stock for a period from Jan. 1, 2010 through Dec. 31,
2011.  Issuance of debt securities by WPL is authorized by the PSCW
and therefore is exempt from regulation by FERC.  FERC does not have
authority over the issuance of securities by Alliant Energy or
Resources.

State
Regulatory Financing Authorizations

- In June 2009, IPL received approval
from the MPUC for its annual capital structure filing, which provides
authorization for IPL to issue debt securities during the 12 months ended June
30, 2010 as long as IPL maintains total capitalization (including short-term
debt) below $3.11 billion and a common equity ratio between 41.3% and 50.5%
during such period.  The annual capital structure filing limits IPL’s
short-term borrowings to a maximum of $300 million outstanding at any time
during the 12 months ended June 30, 2010. IPL received approval from FERC
and the MPUC to borrow directly from its parent should external sources of
short-term debt become unavailable or short-term interest rates become
excessive.  Any borrowings from its parent would be subject to the
maximum limit of its state regulatory financing authorization for short-term
borrowings of $300 million.


In July
2009, WPL received authorization from the PSCW to issue long-term debt
securities of no more than $350 million in 2010.  WPL is also
authorized by the PSCW to have no more than $250 million of short-term
borrowings outstanding.

Shelf
Registrations

- In the second quarter of 2009, IPL and WPL filed shelf
registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC).  IPL’s shelf registration became effective in June 2009 and
provided IPL flexibility to offer from time to time up to an aggregate of $650
million of preferred stock and unsecured debt securities from June 2009 through
June 2012.  WPL’s shelf registration became effective in June 2009 and
provided WPL flexibility to offer up to an aggregate of $700 million of
preferred stock and unsecured debt securities from June 2009 through June
2012.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, IPL and WPL had $350 million and $450
million, respectively, remaining available under their shelf
registrations.  In September 2009, Alliant Energy filed a shelf
registration statement with the SEC, which was effective immediately upon
filing.  Alliant Energy’s shelf registration provides Alliant Energy
flexibility to offer from time to time an unspecified amount of common stock,
senior notes and other securities from September 2009 through September
2012.

Common
Stock Dividends

- In January 2010, Alliant Energy announced an increase
in its expected annual common stock dividend from $1.50 per share to $1.58 per
share, which is equivalent to a rate of $0.395 per share per quarter, beginning
with the Feb. 12, 2010 dividend payment.  Payment of future 2010
quarterly dividends is subject to the actual dividend declaration by Alliant
Energy’s Board of Directors.  Alliant Energy’s general long-term goal
is to maintain a dividend payout ratio that is competitive with the industry
average.  Currently, Alliant Energy’s goal is to attain a dividend
payout percentage of approximately 60% to 70% of its utility
earnings.  Alliant Energy’s dividend payout ratio was 74% of its
utility earnings in 2009.  Refer to Note 7(a) of Alliant Energy’s
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s
dividend payment restrictions based on the terms of their outstanding preferred
stock and applicable regulatory limitations.

Common
Stock Issuances and Capital Contributions

- Alliant Energy issued $1
million, $1 million and $34 million of additional common stock under its equity
incentive plans for employees in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  Alliant Energy currently anticipates its only common
stock issuances in 2010 through 2011 will be to issue new shares to satisfy
demands under its equity incentive plans for employees.  Refer to
Notes 6(b) and 7(a) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for discussion of Alliant Energy’s common stock issuances under its
equity incentive plans for employees and capital contributions from Alliant
Energy to IPL and WPL in 2009.

Common
Stock Repurchase Program

- Refer to Note 7(a) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of Alliant Energy’s common
stock repurchase program, which was completed in 2007.

Short-term
Debt

- In 2007, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL extended the terms of their
respective revolving credit facilities to November 2012.  These credit
facilities backstop commercial paper issuances used to finance short-term
borrowing requirements, which fluctuate based on seasonal corporate needs, the
timing of long-term financings and capital market conditions.  The
facility at the parent company is generally used to fund Resources and Corporate
Services as well as its own needs.  At Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy’s
short-term borrowing arrangements included three revolving credit facilities
totaling $623 million ($96 million for Alliant Energy at the parent company
level, $287 million for IPL and $240 million for WPL).  Currently,
there are 14 lenders that participate in the three credit facilities, with
aggregate respective commitments ranging from $20 million to $68
million.  Alliant Energy anticipates that in March 2010, two lenders
that participate in the three credit facilities will merge, resulting in the
maximum exposure to a single lender increasing from $68 million to $118

During
2009, IPL and WPL issued commercial paper to meet short-term financing
requirements and did not borrow directly under their respective credit
facilities.  During 2009, the Alliant Energy parent company did not
issue commercial paper or borrow directly under its credit
facility.

Alliant
Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s credit facility agreements each contain a covenant
that requires the entities to maintain certain debt-to-capital
ratios.  The debt-to-capital ratios required in order to borrow under
the credit facilities, and the actual debt-to-capital ratios at Dec. 31, 2009
were as follows:

Requirement

Status at Dec. 31,

Alliant
      Energy

Less than
      65%

47%

IPL

Less than
      58%

47%

WPL

Less than
      58%

47%

The debt
component of the capital ratios includes long- and short-term debt (excluding
non-recourse debt and hybrid securities to the extent such hybrid securities do
not exceed 15% of consolidated capital of the borrower), capital lease
obligations, letters of credit, guarantees of the foregoing and new synthetic
leases.  The equity component excludes accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss).

Alliant
Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s credit facility agreements each contain negative
pledge provisions, which generally prohibit placing liens on any of the property
of Alliant Energy or its subsidiaries with certain
exceptions.  Exceptions include among others, securing obligations of
up to 5% of the consolidated assets of the borrower, non-recourse project
financing and purchase money liens.

The
credit facility agreements each contain provisions that require, during their
term, any proceeds from asset sales, with certain exclusions, in excess of 20%
of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s respective consolidated assets to be used
to reduce commitments under their respective facilities.  Exclusions
include, among others, certain sale and lease-back transactions, and
transmission and non-regulated assets.

The
credit facility agreements each contain customary events of
default.  In addition, Alliant Energy’s credit facility agreement
contains a cross-default provision that is triggered if a domestic
majority-owned subsidiary of Alliant Energy incurs an event of default on debt
totaling $50 million or more.  If an event of default under any of the
credit facility agreements occurs and is continuing, the lenders may declare any
outstanding obligations under the credit facility agreements immediately due and
payable and could terminate such agreements.  In addition, if any
order for relief is entered under bankruptcy laws with respect to Alliant
Energy, IPL or WPL, then any outstanding obligations under the respective credit
facility agreements would be immediately due and payable.  At Dec. 31,
2009, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL did not have any direct borrowings outstanding
under their credit facility agreements.  In addition, IPL’s sale of
accounts receivable program agreement contains a cross-default provision that is
triggered if IPL or Alliant Energy incurs an event of default on debt totaling
$50 million or more.  If an event of default under IPL’s sale of
accounts receivable program agreement occurs, then the counterparty could
terminate such agreement.  At Dec. 31, 2009, IPL did not have any
outstanding amounts under its sale of accounts receivable program.  A
default by a minority-owned affiliate or a foreign subsidiary would not trigger
a cross-default event.  A default by either Alliant Energy or
Resources would not trigger a cross-default event for either IPL or WPL, nor
would a default by either of IPL or WPL trigger a cross-default event for the
other under their respective credit facility agreements.

A
material adverse change representation is not required for borrowings under the
credit facility agreements.

At Dec.
31, 2009, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL were in compliance with all covenants and
other provisions of the credit facility agreements.

Credit
ratings are not recommendations to buy or sell securities and are subject to
change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.  None of Alliant Energy, IPL or WPL assumes any obligation to
update their respective credit ratings.


Ratings
Triggers -

The long-term debt of Alliant Energy and its subsidiaries is
not subject to any repayment requirements as a result of explicit credit rating
downgrades or so-called “ratings triggers.”  However, Alliant Energy
and its subsidiaries are parties to various agreements, including PPAs,
commodity contracts and corporate guarantees that are dependent on maintaining
investment-grade credit ratings.  In the event of a downgrade below
investment-grade level, Alliant Energy or its subsidiaries may need to provide
credit support, such as letters of credit or cash collateral equal to the amount
of the exposure, or may need to unwind the contract or pay the underlying
obligation.  In the event of a downgrade below investment-grade level,
management believes Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have sufficient liquidity to
cover counterparty credit support or collateral requirements under these various
agreements.  Refer to Note 11(a) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on ratings
triggers for commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

-

Synthetic
Leases -

Alliant Energy and WPL utilize off-balance sheet synthetic
operating leases related to the financing of certain corporate headquarters
(Alliant Energy) and utility railcars (WPL).  Synthetic leases provide
favorable financing rates to Alliant Energy and WPL while allowing them to
maintain operating control of their leased assets.  Refer to Note 3(a)
of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for future minimum lease
payments and residual value guarantees associated with these synthetic
leases.

Special
Purpose Entities -

IPL uses special purpose entities for its accounts
receivable sale program, which is discussed above in “Cash Flows - Operating
Activities - IPL’s Accounts Receivable Sale Program” and in Note 4(a) of Alliant
Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”  Prior to Jan.
1, 2010, special purpose entities were excluded from the scope of accounting
guidance for variable interest entities.  Under new accounting
guidance effective Jan. 1, 2010, the scope exception for special purpose
entities has been eliminated.  If IPL sells any of its accounts
receivable in the future, the third-party financial institution that purchases
IPL’s receivables will require future evaluation to determine whether it
qualifies as a variable interest entity and whether IPL is the primary
beneficiary.  Refer to Notes 1(r) and 19 of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of the new accounting
guidance and for information regarding variable interest entities,
respectively.

Guarantees
and Indemnifications -

Alliant Energy has guarantees and indemnifications
outstanding related to its prior divestiture activities.  Refer to

(a)

Purchased power and
      fuel commitments represent normal business contracts used to ensure
      adequate purchased power, coal and natural gas supplies and to minimize
      exposure to market price fluctuations.  Alliant Energy, through
      its subsidiary Corporate Services, has entered into various coal
      commitments that have not yet been directly assigned to IPL and
      WPL.  Such commitments are included in the Alliant Energy
      purchased power and fuel commitments but are not included in the IPL or
      WPL purchased power and fuel
commitments.

(b)

Other operating
      expense purchase obligations represent individual commitments incurred
      during the normal course of business that exceeded $1 million at Dec. 31,
      2009.

(c)

In 2008, Corporate
      Services, as agent for IPL and WPL, entered into a master supply agreement
      with Vestas for the purchase of 500 MW of wind turbine generator sets and
      related equipment to support IPL’s and WPL’s wind generation
      plans.  The wind generation plans are described in more detail
      in “Strategic Overview - Utility Generation Plans.”  Minimum
      future commitments for capital purchase obligations related to this
      agreement are based on currency exchange rates at Dec. 31,
      2009.

At Dec.
31, 2009, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL had $101.7 million, $58.4 million and
$42.1 million, respectively, of uncertain tax positions recorded as liabilities,
which are not included in the above tables.  It is uncertain if, and
when, such amounts may be settled with the respective taxing
authorities.  Related to these uncertain tax positions, Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL also recorded liabilities for potential interest of $5.0
million, $2.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, at Dec. 31, 2009, which
are also not included in the above tables.

Refer to
Note 6(a) of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for anticipated
pension and other postretirement benefits funding amounts, which are not
included in the above tables.  Refer to “Cash Flows - Investing
Activities - Construction and Acquisition Expenditures” for additional
information on Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s construction and acquisition
programs.  In addition, at Dec. 31, 2009, there were various other
long-term liabilities and deferred credits included on the respective
Consolidated Balance Sheets that, due to the nature of the liabilities, the
timing of payments cannot be estimated and are therefore excluded from the above
tables.

OTHER MATTERS

Market Risk

Sensitive Instruments and Positions

-

Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s primary market risk exposures are
associated with commodity prices, investment prices, currency exchange rates and
interest rates.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have risk management
policies to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and use
derivative instruments to manage some of the exposures.  Refer to
Notes 1(i) and 11 of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for further discussion of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s
derivative instruments.


Commodity
Price -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are exposed to the impact of market
fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of commodities they procure
and market.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL employ established policies
and procedures to mitigate their risks associated with these market fluctuations
including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various
durations for the forward sale and purchase of these
commodities.  Specifically, IPL and WPL have entered into several
commodity derivative instruments to substantially hedge their open positions
related to electric supply in 2010.  However, IPL and WPL still have
some exposure to commodity risk as a result of changes in their forecasted
electric demand, expected availability of their generating units and the
limitations of WPL’s Electric Risk Management Plan (ERMP) discussed
below.  Alliant Energy’s exposure to commodity price risks in its
utility business is also significantly mitigated by current rate making
structures in place for recovery of its electric production fuel and purchased
energy expenses (fuel-related costs) as well as its cost of natural gas
purchased for resale.  IPL’s electric and gas tariffs and WPL’s gas
and wholesale electric tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its rates
for changes in prudently incurred commodity costs.  IPL’s and WPL’s
rate mechanisms, combined with commodity derivatives, significantly reduce
commodity risk associated with their electric and gas margins.

WPL’s
retail electric margins have the most exposure to the impact of changes in
commodity prices for Alliant Energy and WPL due largely to the current retail
recovery mechanism in place in Wisconsin for fuel-related
costs.  WPL’s retail electric rates approved by the PSCW are based on
forecasts of forward-looking test year periods and include estimates of future
fuel-related costs per MWh anticipated during the test period.  During
each electric retail rate proceeding for WPL that includes fuel-related costs,
the PSCW sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel-related costs
used to determine base rates.  If WPL’s actual fuel-related costs fall
outside these fuel monitoring ranges during the test period, WPL and/or other
parties can request, and the PSCW can authorize, an adjustment to future retail
electric rates based on changes in fuel-related costs only.  The PSCW
on its own, or at the request of a party to the case, including WPL, can request
that the PSCW set rates subject to refund pending a review of fuel-related
costs.  As part of this process, the PSCW may authorize an interim
fuel-related rate increase or decrease until final rates are
approved.  However, if an interim rate increase is granted and the
final rate increase is less than the interim rate increase, WPL must refund the
excess collection to retail customers with interest at the current authorized
return on common equity rate.  As part of WPL’s 2010 retail rate case
order effective Jan. 1, 2010, the PSCW approved annual forecasted fuel-related
costs per MWh of $27.46 based on $378 million of variable fuel costs for WPL’s
2010 test period and left unchanged the annual fuel monitoring range of plus or
minus 2%.

Based on
this current retail recovery mechanism, Alliant Energy and WPL have exposure to
WPL’s retail electric margins from increases in fuel-related costs above the
forecasted fuel-related costs per MWh used to determine electric rates to the
extent such increases are not recovered through prospective fuel only retail
rate changes.  Alliant Energy and WPL have additional commodity price
risk resulting from the lag inherent in obtaining any approved retail rate
relief for potential increases in fuel-related costs above the fuel monitoring
ranges and the prospective nature of any retail rate relief, which precludes WPL
from recovering previously under-recovered costs from ratepayers in the
future.  Alliant Energy and WPL are unable to determine the impact of
changes in commodity prices on their future retail electric margins given the
uncertainty of how future fuel-related costs will correlate with the retail
electric rates in place and the outcome of the proposed changes to the current
retail electric fuel-related cost recovery rules in Wisconsin.  Refer
to “Rate Matters” for additional details of the retail rate recovery mechanism
in Wisconsin for electric fuel-related costs including potential changes to
WPL’s electric fuel-related cost recovery mechanism.

In
October 2008, the PSCW issued an order approving an ERMP for WPL that expires in
December 2010.  The ERMP determines hedging options for WPL’s electric
operations and which costs of hedging transactions can be included in fuel costs
for purposes of cost recovery.  The ERMP was developed with the
involvement of individuals representing key customer groups as well as PSCW
staff, and as proposed, included a number of new elements that would expand
WPL’s hedging options, including longer time horizons and greater protections
for decisions made to take advantage of unusual market
conditions.  However, in approving the ERMP, the PSCW added a new
limitation that WPL may not hedge more than a cumulative 75% of a future month’s
expected open position (expected electric system demand less expected generation
and firm purchases) although this limitation may be waived for the month
immediately preceding the future month in order to assure reliable provision of
service.

Investment
Price -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are exposed to investment price risk
as a result of their investments in debt and equity securities, largely related
to securities held by their pension and other postretirement benefits
plans.  Refer to Note 6(a) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for details of the debt and equity securities held by
their pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  Refer to
“Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits” for the impact on Alliant Energy’s retirement plan costs of changes in
the rate of returns earned by its plan assets.


Currency
Exchange Rate -

Alliant Energy and IPL are exposed to risk resulting from
changes in currency exchange rates as a result of Corporate Services’ master
supply agreement with Vestas to purchase wind turbine generator sets and related
equipment.  A portion of the future payments under the master supply
agreement are denominated in Euros, and therefore, are subject to currency
exchange risk with fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  The
impact of a hypothetical 10% increase in currency exchange rates on the future
Euro-denominated payments under the master supply agreement would increase the
anticipated purchase price of the wind turbine generator sets and related
equipment as of Dec. 31, 2009 by approximately $8.5 million for Alliant Energy
and IPL.

Interest
Rate -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are exposed to risk resulting from
changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance of variable-rate
short-term borrowings.  Assuming the impact of a hypothetical 100
basis point increase in interest rates on consolidated variable-rate short-term
borrowings held at Dec. 31, 2009, both Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s annual pre-tax
expense would increase by approximately $1.9 million.  WPL did not
have any variable-rate short-term borrowings outstanding at Dec. 31,
2009.

In
addition, Alliant Energy and WPL are exposed to changes in earnings resulting
from changes in interest rates as a result of balances of cash and cash
equivalents that are currently invested in money market funds with yields that
may fluctuate daily.  Assuming the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis
point increase in interest rates on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s money market fund
investments at Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s annual interest income
would increase by approximately $1.7 million and $0.2 million,
respectively.  Refer to Note 1(d) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on its investments
in money market funds.

New Accounting Pronouncements

-

Refer to Note 1(r) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for discussion of new accounting pronouncements impacting Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL.

Critical Accounting

Policies and
Estimates

-

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates that
affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported
in the financial statements.  Based on historical experience and
various other factors,

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL believe the following accounting policies and estimates are
critical to their business and the understanding of their financial results as
they require critical assumptions and judgments by management.  The
results of these assumptions and judgments form the basis for making estimates
regarding the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual financial
results may differ materially from these estimates.  Alliant Energy’s,
IPL’s and WPL’s management has discussed these critical accounting policies and
estimates with the Audit Committee of their Board of Directors.  Refer
to Note 1 of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
additional discussion of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s accounting policies
and the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements.

Contingencies
- -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL make assumptions and judgments regarding
the future outcome of contingent events and record loss contingency amounts for
any contingent events that are both probable and reasonably estimable based upon
current available information.  The amounts recorded may differ from
the actual income or expense that occurs when the uncertainty is
resolved.  The estimates that Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL make in
accounting for contingencies, and the gains and losses that they record upon the
ultimate resolution of these uncertainties, could have a significant effect on
the results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their
financial statements.  Refer to Note 1(e) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of the cost cap included in
the IUB order authorizing IPL to construct the 200 MW wind project referred to
as Whispering Willow - East and management’s current assessment regarding its
ability to recover construction costs in excess of the cost
cap.  Refer to Note 12 of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for discussion of current contingencies that may have a
material impact on Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s financial condition or
results of operations.

Regulatory
Assets and Liabilities -

Alliant Energy’s utility subsidiaries (IPL and
WPL) are regulated by various federal and state regulatory
agencies.  As a result, they are subject to accounting guidance for
regulated operations, which recognizes that the actions of a regulator can
provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or
liability.  Regulatory assets or liabilities arise as a result of a
difference between GAAP and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory
agencies.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been
deferred as they are probable of recovery in future customer
rates.  Regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds
to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not
yet been incurred.

IPL and
WPL recognize regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the rulings
of their federal and state regulators and future regulatory rulings may impact
the carrying value and accounting treatment of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s
regulatory assets and liabilities.  Management periodically assesses
whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and the regulatory
liabilities are probable of future obligations by considering factors such as
regulatory environment changes, rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory
agencies and historical decisions by applicable regulatory agencies regarding
similar regulatory assets and liabilities.  The assumptions and
judgments used by regulatory authorities have an impact on the recovery of
costs, the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of
assets to be recovered by rates.  A change in these assumptions may
result in a material impact on Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s results of
operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial
statements.  Refer to Note 1(b) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for details of the nature and amounts of
Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s regulatory assets and liabilities as of Dec.
31, 2009 and 2008.


Long-Lived
Assets

-

Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s
and WPL’s

Consolidated Balance Sheets include long-lived assets, which
are not yet being recovered from their customers or may cease to be recovered
from their customers as a result of regulatory decisions in the
future.  As a result, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL must determine
whether they will be able to generate sufficient future cash flows from such
assets to ensure recovery of the carrying value of the long-lived
assets.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL assess the carrying amount and
potential impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Factors
considered in determining if an impairment review is necessary include a
significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected
future operating results, a significant change in the use of the acquired assets
or business strategy related to such assets, and significant negative industry,
regulatory or economic trends.  When an impairment review is deemed
necessary, a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash
flows and the carrying amount of the asset.  If the carrying amount of
the asset is the larger of the two balances, an impairment loss is recognized
equal to the amount the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of
the asset.  The fair value is determined by the use of quoted market
prices, appraisals, or the use of valuation techniques such as expected
discounted future cash flows.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL must make
assumptions and judgments regarding these estimated future cash flows and other
factors to determine the recoverability and fair value of its long-lived
assets.  Refer to Note 1(e) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for details of wind sites and wind turbine generators
currently expected to be used by IPL and WPL to develop future wind projects,
and IPL’s Sixth Street Generating Station damaged by the severe flooding in
2008.

Unbilled
Revenues -

Unbilled revenues are primarily associated with Alliant
Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s utility operations.  Energy sales to
individual customers are based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a
systematic basis throughout the month.  At the end of each month,
amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter
reading are estimated and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is
recorded.  The unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system
demand volumes, estimated customer usage by class, weather impacts, line losses
and the most recent customer rates.  Such process involves the use of
various judgments and assumptions and significant changes in these judgments and
assumptions could have a material impact on Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s
results of operations.  At Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, unbilled revenues
associated with Alliant Energy’s utility operations were $169 million ($82
million at IPL and $87 million at WPL) and $186 million ($94 million at IPL and
$92 million at WPL), respectively.  Refer to “Alliant Energy’s Results
of Operations - Utility Electric Margins - Unbilled Revenue Estimates” for
discussion of annual adjustments to unbilled electric revenue estimates in the
second quarters of 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL sponsors
various defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans that
provide benefits to a significant portion of their
employees.  Accounting for these retirement plans requires the use of
judgments and assumptions, which represent significant
estimates.  There are many judgments and assumptions involved in
determining an entity’s pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs
each period including employee demographics (including age, life expectancies
and compensation levels), discount rates, assumed rate of returns and
funding.  Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current
and future benefits costs.  Judgments and assumptions are supported by
historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed
annually.  As of Dec. 31, 2009 (Alliant Energy’s most recent
measurement date), future assumptions included discount rates of 5.80% and 5.55%
to calculate benefit obligations associated with its defined benefit pension and
other postretirement benefits plans, respectively, and an 8.25% future annual
expected rate of return on plan assets.  In selecting an assumed
discount rate, management reviews various corporate Aa bond
indices.  The 8.25% annual expected rate of return is based on
projected long-term equity and bond returns, maturities and asset
allocations.  The following table shows the impacts of changing
certain key actuarial assumptions discussed above (in millions):

Refer to
Notes 1(j) and 6(a) of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
additional discussion of the accounting for pension and other postretirement
benefits.  Refer to “Other Future Considerations - Retirement Plan
Costs” for discussion of anticipated material decreases in pension and other
postretirement benefits expenses in 2010 resulting from increases in retirement
plans’ assets during 2009.


Income
Taxes -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to income taxes in
various jurisdictions.  Accounting for income taxes requires judgments
and assumptions to determine an entity’s income tax assets, liabilities,
benefits and expenses each period.  These judgments and assumptions
represent significant estimates and include projections of Alliant Energy’s
future taxable income used to determine its ability to utilize loss and credit
carryforwards prior to their expiration and the interpretation of tax laws
regarding uncertain tax positions.  Judgments and assumptions are
supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed
quarterly by management.  Significant changes in these judgments and
assumptions could have a material impact on Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s
financial condition and results of operations.

Federal
Net Operating Loss Carryforward Utilization

- Alliant Energy currently
expects its Federal tax return for calendar year 2009 will include a Federal net
operating loss of approximately $392 million primarily due to an estimated $427
million of bonus depreciation deductions allowed in 2009 under the
ARRA.  Federal net operating losses for each calendar year can be
utilized to offset Federal taxable income in other years by carrying the losses
back two years or forward 20 years.  Alliant Energy currently expects
to utilize approximately $237 million of its 2009 Federal net operating loss to
offset Federal taxable income generated prior to 2009 and utilize the remaining
$155 million of its 2009 Federal net operating loss to offset Federal taxable
income in the future.  Based on current projections of Alliant
Energy’s future Federal taxable income, the 2009 Federal net operating loss
carryforwards are expected to be fully utilized in the Federal tax return for
the calendar year 2011.  Alliant Energy’s Federal tax return for
calendar year 2008 included a Federal net operating loss that was fully utilized
to partially offset Federal taxable income in 2006 and 2007.

Federal
Tax Credit Carryforward Utilization

- Alliant Energy generates Federal
tax credits each year primarily based on the amount of electricity generated by
wind projects at IPL and WPL and the amount of its research and development
activities.  In addition, in prior years, Alliant Energy generated
significant non-conventional source fuel credits.  Federal tax credits
reduce Alliant Energy’s Federal income tax obligations in calendar years that
Alliant Energy generates sufficient Federal taxable income to utilize the tax
credits.  If Alliant Energy does not generate sufficient Federal
taxable income to utilize the Federal tax credits generated for that year, the
Federal tax credits can be carried back and carried forward to be utilized to
reduce Federal income tax obligations if sufficient Federal taxable income
exists in the carry back and carry forward years.  The Federal tax
credits have different expiration periods with the most stringent limiting the
carry forward period to 20 years.  As a result of Federal net
operating losses generated in 2009 and 2008 that were carried back to prior
years, Federal tax credits of $65 million previously used in prior years’
Federal tax returns will now be required to be carried forward to be
utilized.  In addition, prior year’s alternative minimum tax of $10
million will also be carried forward as credits to be
utilized.  Federal tax credits generated in 2009 of $5 million will
also be required to be carried forward to be utilized.  Based on
current projections of Alliant Energy’s future Federal taxable income, all
current Federal tax credit carry forwards with specific expiration periods are
expected to be utilized by 2011.

Wisconsin
Net Operating Loss Utilization

- In February 2009, SB 62 was
enacted.  The current provisions of SB 62 make it unlikely that
Alliant Energy will be able to utilize a substantial portion of its current
Wisconsin net operating loss carryforwards before they expire.  As a
result, Alliant Energy recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax
assets associated with its Wisconsin net operating loss carryforwards, which
increased income tax expense by $6 million in 2009.  At Dec. 31, 2009,
Alliant Energy had deferred tax asset valuation allowances related to Wisconsin
net operating loss carryforwards of $18 million.

Capital
Loss Utilization

- The provisions of SB 62 and WPL’s recent plans to be
included in Iowa consolidated returns in order to take advantage of efficiencies
that will likely be available as a result of IPL and WPL sharing resources and
facilities resulted in changes in expected state apportioned income tax
rates.  These changes in expected state apportioned income tax rates
resulted in changes in the amount of deferred tax assets related to Wisconsin
capital loss carryforwards and associated valuation allowances in
2009.  At Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy had deferred income tax asset
valuation allowances related to Wisconsin capital loss carryforwards of $9
million.

Refer to
Note 5 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
details regarding tax carryforwards and uncertain tax positions of Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL.


Other Future

Considerations

-

In addition to items discussed earlier in MDA, in the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 and in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A,
the following items could impact Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s or WPL’s future
financial condition or results of operations:

IPL’s
Electric Transmission Service Charges -

IPL currently receives
substantially all its transmission services from ITC.  The annual
transmission service rates that ITC charge their customers is calculated each
calendar year using a FERC-approved cost of service formula rate template
referred to as Attachment O.  The Attachment O rate is based on ITC’s
projected net revenue requirement for the upcoming calendar year (i.e. the year
the rates will be billed) as well as a true-up adjustment for any over-recovered
or under-recovered amounts from the previous calendar year (i.e. two years prior
to the year the rates will be billed).  Because Attachment O is a
FERC-approved formula rate, ITC can implement new rates each calendar year
without filing a request with FERC.  However, new rates are subject to
challenge by FERC if the rates proposed by ITC are determined by FERC to be
unjust or unreasonable or another mechanism is determined by FERC to be just and
reasonable.

In November 2008, IPL filed a FERC 206
complaint against ITC concerning certain cost components included in ITC’s 2009
proposed rates.  ITC requested that the FERC 206 complaint be
dismissed on the grounds that the asset sale agreement between IPL and ITC
barred IPL from challenging the rate elements for a seven-year
period.  IPL maintains that its complaint does not take issue with the
use of forward-looking data to set rates and instead is challenging how these
rates were implemented.  In April 2009, FERC denied IPL’s FERC 206
complaint filed against ITC.  FERC concluded that IPL had not
presented adequate evidence that ITC’s formula rate implementation produced
unjust and unreasonable rates with respect to operations and maintenance and
administrative and general expenses for 2009.  FERC also rejected
IPL’s allegations that ITC had not been adequately forthcoming with information
about its projected rates and true-up.  In May 2009, IPL filed a
request for rehearing with FERC.  In June 2009, FERC granted IPL’s
request for rehearing; however, it is unknown when FERC will take final action
on the complaint.

In
October 2009, ITC filed with MISO the Attachment “O” rate it proposes to
charge its customers in 2010 for transmission services.  The proposed
rate was based on ITC’s net revenue requirement for 2010 as well as the impact
of a true-up adjustment related to amounts that ITC under-recovered from its
customers in 2008.  The 2010 Attachment “O” rate is approximately 60%
higher than the rate ITC charged IPL in 2009.  Based on this proposed
rate increase, IPL estimates the electric transmission service charges from ITC
for 2010 will be approximately $85 million to $95 million higher than
2009.  In January 2010, the IUB issued an order authorizing IPL to use
$46 million of regulatory liabilities to offset the portion of the transmission
service charges expected to be billed in 2010 related to ITC’s 2008 true-up
adjustment.  IPL currently plans to file retail electric rate cases in
Iowa and Minnesota in 2010 to address the recovery of the remaining expected
increases in transmission services charges from ITC for 2010.  Refer
to “Rate Matters - Proposed Changes to Rate Recovery Mechanisms” for proposals
made by IPL to each of the IUB and MPUC to implement an automatic adjustment
clause for electric transmission service charges incurred by IPL to serve its
utility customers.  Alliant Energy and IPL are currently unable to
predict the ultimate impact of ITC’s proposed transmission rate increase for
2010, but believe it could have a material impact on their financial condition
and results of operations in 2010.

Retirement
Plan Costs

- Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s net periodic benefit costs
related to their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans
are currently expected to be lower in 2010 than 2009 by approximately $25
million, $15 million and $10 million, respectively.  The decrease in
expected net periodic benefit costs are primarily due to lower amortization of
actuarial losses and higher expected returns on plan assets resulting from
significant increases in retirement plan assets during
2009.  Approximately 30% to 40% of net periodic benefit costs are
allocated to capital projects each year.  As a result, the decrease in
net periodic benefit costs is not expected to result in a comparable decrease in
other operation and maintenance expenses.  In addition, the PSCW
authorized WPL to defer $12 million of other operation and maintenance expenses
incurred in 2009 related to the retail portion of net periodic benefit costs
that exceeded levels used to determine retail rates in 2009.  Refer to
Note 6(a) of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
details of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefits plans.

Electric
Sales Projections -

Economic
Conditions

- Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently expecting modest
decreases in weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2010 compared to 2009
largely due to economic conditions in their service territories and reduced
sales to two of IPL’s industrial customers discussed below.  Electric
sales from industrial customers in 2010 are expected to be impacted the most as
a result of the full year impacts of plant closures at various industrial
customers in Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s service territories in
2009.


Customer
Owned Generation

- Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), owner of wet corn
milling plants in Iowa and historically one of IPL’s largest industrial
customers, constructed a 105 MW cogeneration facility and a 75 MW cogeneration
facility in Clinton, Iowa to meet its own electric demand.  ADM fully
transitioned to its cogeneration facilities in the fourth quarter of
2009.  Roquette America, owner of a wet corn milling plant in Iowa and
one of IPL’s largest industrial customers, constructed a 34 MW cogeneration
facility in Keokuk, Iowa to partially meet its own electric
demand.  Roquette America transitioned to its cogeneration facilities
in the second quarter of 2009.  The transition of ADM and Roquette
America to their cogeneration facilities is expected to result in a material
reduction to Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s future electric industrial sales and
electric margins.

Ethanol
Production

- Ethanol production in the U.S. experienced growth since 2002
largely due to a mandate for ethanol usage in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and
the promotion of E85, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, used to fuel
vehicles.  Ethanol production facilities in the U.S. are concentrated
in the corn-growing regions in the Midwest given corn is the primary raw
material used to produce ethanol.  Electricity demand from new ethanol
production facilities located in Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s utility
service territories has resulted in an increase in electric sales
volumes.  Currently there is one ethanol plant that is under
construction within IPL’s service territory, which is expected to be completed
in late 2010 or early 2011.  Once completed, this plant may add
another 46 MW of electricity demand to Alliant Energy’s existing demand from
ethanol plants, which is approximately 113 MW (89 MW in IPL’s service territory
and 24 MW in WPL’s service territory) currently.  A number of
previously announced plants in Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s service
territories have not begun construction, which is reflective of a nationwide
slowdown in the construction of ethanol production facilities.  This
slowdown has been caused by a number of factors including changes in the price
of ethanol, a decline in the cost of gasoline, an increase in the cost of corn,
tighter access to financing and escalation of construction costs to build the
production facilities.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently
unable to estimate the impacts ethanol production facilities in their service
territories will have on their future electric sales demand and electric
margins.

Government
Incentives for Wind Projects -

Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s
corporate strategy includes building wind projects to produce electricity to
meet customer demand and renewable portfolio standards.  In addition
to producing electricity, these wind projects may also generate material
incentives depending on when they begin commercial operation.  The
ARRA enacted in February 2009 provides incentives to owners of wind projects
placed into service between Jan. 1, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2012.  The
incentives available to qualified wind projects under the ARRA include
production tax credits for a 10-year period based on the electricity output
generated by the wind project, an investment tax credit equal to 30% of the
qualified cost basis of the wind project, or a government grant equal to 30% of
the qualified cost basis of the wind project.  The government grant
incentive is only available for qualified wind projects that are placed into
service in 2009 or 2010 and qualified wind projects that began construction in
2009 or 2010 and are placed into service by Dec. 31, 2012.

Alliant
Energy’s utility generation plan has three wind projects that currently qualify,
or are expected to qualify, for one of these incentives based on the provisions
of the ARRA.  These three wind projects are IPL’s Whispering Willow -
East wind project (200 MW capacity) that began commercial operation in the
fourth quarter of 2009, WPL’s Bent Tree - Phase I wind project (200 MW capacity)
that is expected to be fully commercially operational in 2011, and IPL’s
Whispering Willow - West wind project (100 MW capacity) that is expected to
begin commercial operation in 2012 pending regulatory approval for the
project.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL continue to evaluate the three
options to maximize the incentives for its wind projects.  Selection
of the government grant option must be made prior to the application deadline on
Sep. 30, 2011.  Selection of the investment tax credit option must be
made prior to the due date of the Federal tax return for the calendar year the
wind project begins commercial operation.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL
currently plan to recognize production tax credits for their eligible wind
project until an incentive option is selected for each project.  IPL
currently expects to recognize production tax credits between $5 million to $10
million in 2010 for its Whispering Willow - East wind project.  The
amount of production tax credits is dependent on the level of electricity output
generated by the wind project, which is impacted by a variety of operating and
economic parameters.  Any incentives for IPL’s and WPL’s wind projects
are expected to be utilized in determining customers’ rates.

Maintenance
Costs for Wind Projects -

Wind projects require periodic maintenance to
ensure reliability of operations.  IPL and WPL have entered into
agreements with outside vendors to provide these services for their Whispering
Willow - East and Bent Tree - Phase I wind projects.  IPL and WPL
currently estimate approximately $7 million to $8 million of annual maintenance
expenses for each of its Whispering Willow - East and Bent Tree - Phase I wind
projects after they begin commercial operations.


Incentive
Compensation Plans -

Alliant Energy’s total compensation package includes
an incentive compensation program, which provides substantially all of Alliant
Energy’s non-bargaining employees an opportunity to receive annual short-term
incentive cash payments based on the achievement of specific annual operational
and financial performance measures.  The operational performance
measures relate to diversity, safety and customer satisfaction and the financial
performance measures include utility earnings per share from continuing
operations and cash flows from operations generated by IPL, WPL and Corporate
Services.  In addition, the total compensation program for certain key
employees includes long-term incentive awards issued under an Equity Incentive
Plan (EIP).  Refer to Note 6(b) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion of outstanding
awards issued under Alliant Energy’s EIP and Alliant Energy's proposed 2010
Omnibus Incentive Plan.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently
unable to determine what impacts these incentive compensation plans will have on
their future financial condition or results of operations.

Resources’
Cedar River Railroad Bridge Grant -

Resources’ railroad bridge over the
Cedar River was severely damaged by flooding in 2008.  Resources’
reconstruction of the bridge was completed in July 2009.  Costs
incurred by Resources for clean up and reconstruction of the bridge due to the
flood damage were $9 million.  In May 2009, Resources was notified
that it was awarded a $7 million grant from the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA), which will cover the majority of the cost to replace the
bridge.  Resources is currently unable to determine when it will
receive the $7 million from the FRA.  Any grant amounts received by
Resources will primarily be used to reduce property, plant and equipment and
therefore will not have a material impact on Alliant Energy’s results of
operations.

Resources’
Interchange Project Grant Application -

In 2009,

Resources,
along with the Iowa Department of Transportation, applied for a $7 million grant
made available through the ARRA.  This grant is specific to the
transportation industry and is available through the Transportation Investment
Generating Economic Recovery Discretionary Grant process.  Any grant
amounts received by Resources will be used to cover a majority of the
engineering, procurement and construction costs for the addition of two rail
spurs in Iowa.  Resources is currently unable to determine whether it
will be awarded the $7 million grant funds.  Any grant amounts
received by Resources will be used to reduce property, plant and equipment and
therefore will not have a material impact on Alliant Energy’s results of
operations.

MANAGEMENT’S
ANNUAL REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The
management of Alliant Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (Alliant Energy) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Alliant Energy’s internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Alliant
Energy’s management assessed the effectiveness of Alliant Energy’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 using the criteria set
forth in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment,
Alliant Energy’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, Alliant
Energy’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Deloitte
& Touche LLP, Alliant Energy’s independent registered public accounting
firm, has audited Alliant Energy’s internal control over financial
reporting.  That report is set forth immediately prior to the report
of Deloitte & Touche LLP on the financial statements included
herein.

REPORT
OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Shareowners of Alliant Energy Corporation

Madison,
Wisconsin

We have
audited the internal control over financial reporting of Alliant Energy
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009, based on
the

criteria
established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria
established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 of
the Company and our report dated February 26, 2010, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
schedules.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Shareowners of Alliant Energy Corporation

Madison,
Wisconsin

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alliant Energy
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
and the related consolidated statements of income, common equity, comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2009.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed in the Index at Item 15.  These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our
audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our
opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2009 and
2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)  General
- -

Description
of Business

- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Alliant Energy Corporation (Alliant Energy) and its consolidated
subsidiaries.  Alliant Energy is an investor-owned public utility
holding company, whose primary subsidiaries are Interstate Power and Light
Company (IPL), Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL), Alliant Energy
Resources, LLC (Resources) and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc.
(Corporate Services).

IPL and
WPL are utility subsidiaries that are engaged principally in the generation and
distribution of electric energy and the distribution and transportation of
natural gas in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota.  IPL is also engaged in
the generation and distribution of steam for certain customers in Cedar Rapids,
Iowa.  Refer to Notes 1(e), 17 and 22 for discussion of IPL’s steam
plant in service that was impacted by the severe flooding in downtown Cedar
Rapids, Iowa in June 2008, Alliant Energy’s utility operations in Illinois sold
in February 2007 and IPL’s electric transmission assets sold in December 2007,
respectively.

Resources
is comprised of RMT (including WindConnect®), Non-regulated Generation,
Transportation and other non-regulated investments.  RMT provides
renewable energy services and environmental consulting and engineering services
to industrial and commercial clients nationwide.  Non-regulated
Generation owns the 300 megawatt (MW), simple-cycle, natural gas-fired Sheboygan
Falls Energy Facility near Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, which is leased to WPL
for an initial period of 20 years ending in 2025.  Also included in
Non-regulated Generation is Industrial Energy Applications, Inc. (IEA), which
provides on-site energy services with small standby
generators.  Transportation includes a short-line railway that
provides freight service between Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; barge
terminal and hauling services on the Mississippi River; and other transfer and
storage services.

Corporate
Services is the subsidiary formed to provide administrative services to Alliant
Energy and its subsidiaries.

Basis
of Presentation

- The consolidated financial statements reflect
investments in controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and Alliant
Energy’s proportionate shares of jointly owned utility
facilities.  Unconsolidated investments, which Alliant Energy does not
control, but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over
operating and financial policies (generally, 20% to 50% voting interest), are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Investments that
do not meet the criteria for consolidation or the equity method of accounting
are accounted for under the cost method.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL
did not reflect any variable interest entities on a consolidated basis in their
consolidated financial statements.  Refer to Notes 9(a) and 19 for
further discussion of equity method investments and variable interest entities,
respectively.

All
significant intercompany balances and transactions, other than certain
energy-related transactions affecting IPL and WPL, have been eliminated from the
consolidated financial statements.  Such energy-related transactions
not eliminated include costs that are recoverable from customers through rate
making processes.  The consolidated financial statements are prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S.) (GAAP), which give recognition to the rate making and
accounting practices of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and
state commissions having regulatory jurisdiction.  Certain prior
period amounts have been reclassified on a basis consistent with the current
period financial statement presentation.  Unless otherwise noted, the
notes herein have been revised to exclude discontinued operations for all
periods presented.

Use
of Estimates

- The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect: a) the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and b) the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(b)  Regulatory
Assets and Liabilities -

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC and various state
regulatory commissions.  As a result, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are
subject to GAAP provisions for regulated operations, which provide that
rate-regulated public utilities record certain costs and credits allowed in the
rate making process in different periods than for non-regulated
entities.  These are deferred as regulatory assets or accrued as
regulatory liabilities and are generally recognized in the Consolidated
Statements of Income at the time they are reflected in rates.

A portion
of the regulatory assets in the above table are not earning a
return.  These regulatory assets are expected to be recovered from
customers in future rates, however the carrying costs of these assets are borne
by Alliant Energy’s shareowners.  At Dec. 31, 2009, IPL and WPL had
$62 million and $25 million, respectively, of regulatory assets representing
past expenditures that were not earning a return.  IPL’s regulatory
assets that were not earning a return consisted primarily of costs for proposed
base-load and clean air compliance projects, debt redemption costs and
flood-related costs.  WPL’s regulatory assets that were not earning a
return consisted primarily of debt redemption costs, the wholesale portion of
costs for proposed base-load and clean air compliance projects and the retail
portion of under collected natural gas costs.  All other regulatory
assets reported in the above table either earn a return or the cash has not yet
been expended, in which case the assets are offset by liabilities that also do
not incur a carrying cost.

Pension
and other postretirement benefits -

The Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) and
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) have authorized IPL and WPL,
respectively, to record the retail portion of their previously unrecognized net
actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and transition
assets and obligations as regulatory assets in lieu of accumulated other
comprehensive loss on their respective Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  IPL and WPL also recognize the wholesale portion of their
previously unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs and
credits and transition assets and obligations as regulatory assets on their
respective Consolidated Balance Sheets because these costs are expected to be
recovered in rates in future periods under the formula rate structure
implemented in 2007.  These regulatory assets will be increased or
decreased as the net actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits,
and transition assets or obligations are subsequently amortized and recognized
as a component of net periodic benefit costs.

Tax-related

-

IPL and WPL record regulatory assets for certain temporary differences
(primarily related to utility property, plant and equipment at IPL) that result
in a decrease in current rates charged to customers and an increase in future
rates charged to customers based on the timing of income tax expense that is
used to determine such rates.   These temporary differences
include the impact of accelerated tax depreciation, which contributes to lower
income tax expense during the first part of an asset’s useful life and higher
tax expense during the last part of an asset’s useful life.  These
regulatory assets will be recovered from customers in the future when these
temporary differences reverse resulting in additional income tax expense used to
determine customers’ rates.  Refer to Note 5 for discussion of a
change in the tax methods for accounting for repairs expenditures and allocating
flood insurance proceeds, which resulted in a material increase in regulatory
assets on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets during
2009.

Derivatives
- -

IPL and WPL generally record unrealized losses from their derivative
instruments with offsets to regulatory assets based on their fuel and natural
gas cost recovery mechanisms, which allow prudently incurred costs from
derivative instruments to be recovered from customers in the future when any
losses are realized.

Asset
retirement obligations -

IPL and WPL believe it is probable that any
differences between expenses accrued for legal asset retirement obligations
related to its regulated operations and expenses recovered currently in rates
will be recoverable in future rates, and is deferring the difference as a
regulatory asset.


Environmental-related
- -

The IUB has permitted utilities to recover prudently incurred costs by
allowing a representative level of manufactured gas plants (MGP) costs in retail
gas rate cases.  Under the current rate making treatment approved by
the PSCW, the MGP expenditures of WPL are deferred and collected from retail gas
customers over a five-year period after new rates are
implemented.  The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) also
allows the deferral of MGP-related costs applicable to the Minnesota sites and
IPL has been successful in obtaining approval to recover such costs in retail
gas rates in Minnesota.  Regulatory assets have been recorded by IPL
and WPL, which reflect the probable future rate recovery of MGP
expenditures.

Proposed
base-load projects

IPL’s
base-load project

- In March 2009, IPL announced a decision to cancel the
construction of the proposed 630 MW coal-fired electric generating facility in
Marshalltown, Iowa referred to as Sutherland #4.  Costs included in
the above table as of Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008 include the remaining Iowa retail
portion of costs related to this project.  In addition, costs included
in the above table as of Dec. 31, 2008 include the remaining Minnesota retail
portion of costs related to this project.

Iowa
retail

- In January 2010, IPL received approval from the IUB to recover
$26 million of the Sutherland #4 costs from its retail customers in Iowa by
amortizing the costs over a five-year period ending September 2014 and
offsetting the amortization of these costs with an equal reduction of the
regulatory liability resulting from the sale of the Duane Arnold Energy Center
(DAEC).  The IUB also determined that IPL should not include the
unamortized balance of these Sutherland #4 costs in rate base during the
five-year recovery period.

Minnesota
retail

- In November 2009, the MPUC issued a decision denying IPL’s
request to defer the Minnesota retail portion of the Sutherland #4 costs as of
Dec. 31, 2008 in the above table.  As a result of this MPUC decision,
Alliant Energy and IPL recorded a pre-tax regulatory-related charge of $2
million in “Other operation and maintenance” on their Consolidated Statements of
Income in 2009.

Refer to
Note 12(g) for discussion of a settlement agreement entered into in the fourth
quarter of 2009 related to a request from the joint partners for reimbursement
of their portion of the Sutherland #4 costs.

WPL’s
base-load project

- In December 2008, the PSCW issued an order denying
WPL’s application to construct a 300 MW coal-fired electric generating facility
in Cassville, Wisconsin referred to as Nelson Dewey #3.  Costs
included in the above table reflect the remaining retail and wholesale portions
of costs related to this project.

Retail
portion

- In December 2008, WPL received approval from the PSCW to
recover $4 million from its retail customers during calendar year 2009 for a
portion of the costs incurred through December 2007.  In December
2009, WPL received approval from the PSCW to recover an additional $11 million
of project costs from its retail customers over a five-year period ending
December 2014.  In December 2009, the PSCW also denied WPL recovery of
the remaining project costs, which represent all project costs incurred by WPL
after June 2008 and one-half of the pre-construction project costs incurred by
WPL prior to July 2008.  As a result of this PSCW order, Alliant
Energy and WPL recorded a pre-tax regulatory-related charge of $11 million in
“Other operation and maintenance” on their Consolidated Statements of Income in
2009.

Wholesale
portion

- In April 2009, WPL executed an agreement with its wholesale
customers to recover $4 million of the wholesale portion of the capitalized
expenditures for the Nelson Dewey #3 project that were incurred by WPL through
December 2008.  The agreement allows WPL to recover the $4 million of
capitalized expenditures from its wholesale customers over a 12-month period
ending May 2010.  As a result of this agreement, Alliant Energy and
WPL recorded a pre-tax regulatory-related charge of $4 million in “Other
operation and maintenance” on their Consolidated Statements of Income in
2008.

Proposed
Clean Air Compliance Program (CACP) projects -

CACP projects require
material expenditures for activities related to determining the feasibility of
environmental compliance projects under consideration.  These
expenditures commonly called preliminary survey and investigation charges are
generally recorded as regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in
accordance with FERC regulations.  In Iowa, no specific retail
authorization is required before charging these costs to regulatory asset
accounts.  In Wisconsin, the retail portion of these amounts is
expensed immediately unless otherwise authorized by the
PSCW.  However, since these amounts are material for WPL’s CACP
projects, WPL requested and received deferral accounting approval to record the
retail portion of these costs as regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.


For IPL,
amounts deferred and recorded as preliminary survey and investigation charges do
not include any accrual of carrying costs or allowance for funds used during
construction (AFUDC).  Upon regulatory approval of the projects, all
such amounts included as preliminary survey and investigation charges are
transferred to construction work in progress (CWIP) and begin to accrue
AFUDC.

For WPL,
the wholesale portion of amounts deferred and recorded as preliminary survey and
investigation charges do not include any accrual of carrying costs or
AFUDC.  WPL’s retail portion of deferred preliminary survey and
investigation charges (commonly referred to as pre-certification expenditures)
and construction expenditures incurred prior to project approval that are
recorded in regulatory assets include accrual of carrying costs as prescribed in
the approved deferral order.  Upon regulatory approval of the project,
the wholesale portion of deferred preliminary survey and investigation charges
as well as all pre-construction expenditures are transferred to CWIP and begin
to accrue AFUDC.  The retail portion of deferred preliminary survey
and investigation charges or pre-certification expenditures remain as regulatory
assets until they are approved for inclusion in revenue requirements and
amortized to expense.  In December 2009, WPL received approval from
the PSCW to recover $4 million from its retail customers over a three-year
period ending December 2012 for a portion of the pre-certification expenditures
incurred through December 2008.

IPL and
WPL anticipate that all remaining costs for proposed clean air compliance
projects are probable of recovery from future rates charged to
customers.  The recovery period for these remaining costs will
generally be determined by regulators in future rate proceedings.

Debt
redemption costs -

For debt retired early with no subsequent re-issuance,
IPL and WPL defer any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts as
regulatory assets.  These regulatory assets are amortized over the
remaining original life of the debt retired early.  Losses resulting
from the refinancing of debt by IPL and WPL are deferred as regulatory assets
and amortized over the life of the new debt issued.

WPL
benefits costs -

In December 2008, WPL received approval from the PSCW to
defer the retail portion of pension and other benefit costs charged to other
operation and maintenance expenses during 2009 in excess of $4
million.  WPL’s retail portion of pension and other benefit costs
expensed during 2009 were $16 million resulting in the recognition of a
regulatory asset of $12 million for the deferred portion of these
costs.  In December 2009, WPL received approval from the PSCW to
recover the deferred costs over a five-year period ending December
2014.

IPL
flood-related costs -

In January 2010, IPL received approval from the IUB
to recover $8 million from its retail customers in Iowa over a four-year period
ending December 2013 related to costs incurred in 2008 as a result of severe
flooding in IPL’s service territory.  These costs included $4 million
of operations and maintenance expenses and $4 million of charges for leasing
temporary generating capacity.  Based on information presented during
the rate proceeding in 2009 and the order received in January 2010, Alliant
Energy and IPL recorded pre-tax regulatory-related credits of $4 million in
“Other operation and maintenance” and $4 million in “Purchased electric
capacity” on their Consolidated Statements of Income in 2009.

WPL
MISO-related costs

-

In August 2007, the PSCW issued an order requiring WPL to discontinue, effective
Dec. 31, 2007, the deferral of the retail portion of certain costs incurred by
WPL to participate in the MISO market.  WPL incurred $10 million of
deferred retail costs prior to 2008 to participate in the MISO market that were
recognized in regulatory assets on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  In December 2008, WPL received approval from the PSCW
to recover the $10 million of deferred retail costs over a two-year period
ending December 2010.  MISO costs incurred after Dec. 31, 2007 are
subject to recovery through WPL’s retail electric fuel-related cost recovery
mechanism.

Other
- -

IPL and WPL assess whether their regulatory assets are probable of
future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulations, recent
orders by the applicable regulatory agencies, historical treatment of similar
costs by the applicable regulatory agencies and regulatory environment
changes.  Based on these assessments, IPL and WPL believe the
regulatory assets recognized as of Dec. 31, 2009 in the above table are probable
of future recovery.  However, no assurance can be made that IPL and
WPL will recover all of these regulatory assets in future rates.  If
future recovery of a regulatory asset ceases to be probable, the regulatory
asset will be charged to expense in the period in which future recovery ceases
to be probable.

Regulatory liabilities
related to cost of removal obligations, to the extent expensed through
depreciation rates, reduce rate base.  A significant portion of the
remaining regulatory liabilities are not used to reduce rate base in the revenue
requirement calculations utilized in IPL’s and WPL’s respective rate
proceedings.

Cost of
removal obligations -

Alliant Energy collects in rates future removal
costs for many assets that do not have an associated legal asset retirement
obligation.  Alliant Energy records a regulatory liability for the
estimated amounts it has collected in rates for these future removal costs less
amounts spent on removal activities.

Tax-related
- -

Refer to Note 5 for discussion of a change in the tax methods for
accounting for repairs expenditures and allocating flood insurance proceeds,
which resulted in a material increase in regulatory liabilities on Alliant
Energy’s and IPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets during 2009.

IPL
electric transmission assets sale -

In December 2007, IPL completed the
sale of its electric transmission assets to ITC Midwest LLC (ITC) and recognized
a gain based on the terms of the agreement.  Upon closing of the sale,
IPL established a regulatory liability of $89 million pursuant to conditions
established by the IUB when it allowed the transaction to
proceed.  The regulatory liability represented the present value of
IPL’s obligation to refund to its customers payments beginning in the year IPL’s
customers experience an increase in rates related to the transmission charges
assessed by ITC.

In June
2009, the IUB issued an order authorizing IPL to use a portion of this
regulatory liability to reduce Iowa retail electric customers’ rates by $12
million for the period from July 2009 through February 2010 with billing credits
included in the monthly energy adjustment clause.  As of Dec. 31,
2009, IPL refunded $8 million to its Iowa retail electric
customers.  In January 2010, the IUB issued an order authorizing IPL
to use $46 million of this regulatory liability to offset electric transmission
costs expected to be billed to IPL by ITC in 2010 related to ITC’s 2008
transmission revenue adjustment.  Refunds related to the remaining
balance of this regulatory liability are expected to be determined in future
rate proceedings.  Refer to Note 22 for additional information
regarding the electric transmission assets sale.

Emission
allowances -

IPL and WPL have entered into various transactions for the
purchase and sale or non-monetary exchange of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen
oxide (NOx) emission allowances.  The emission allowances acquired in
these transactions were recorded as intangible assets.  The value
received from these transactions was recorded as regulatory liabilities given
the emission allowances relinquished had a zero-cost basis.  The
amortization of these intangible assets and regulatory liabilities are equal and
offsetting and based on the amount of the emission allowances acquired that were
utilized each reporting period.

IPL
DAEC sale -

In January 2006, IPL completed the sale of its 70% ownership
interest in DAEC and recognized a regulatory liability of approximately $59
million from the transaction based on the terms of the sale
agreement.  Pursuant to the IUB order approving the DAEC sale, the
gain resulting from the sale was used to establish a regulatory
liability.  In 2009, IPL received $12 million as part of a settlement
of a claim filed against the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in 2004 for
recovery of damages due to the DOE’s delay in accepting spent nuclear fuel
produced at DAEC.  IPL recognized the $12 million received from the
settlement as an increase to the regulatory liability established with the sale
of DAEC.  The regulatory liability accrues interest at the monthly
average U.S. Treasury rate for three-year maturities.


In
September 2009, the IUB authorized IPL to utilize this regulatory liability to
offset AFUDC for investments in new generation in Iowa.  In 2009, IPL
recognized a $29 million reduction in this regulatory liability with an
offsetting reduction in electric plant in service related to the cumulative
AFUDC recognized for the Whispering Willow - East wind project.  In
January 2010, IPL received approval from the IUB to utilize $26 million of this
regulatory liability to offset the amortization of costs incurred for the
Sutherland #4 project over a five-year period ending September
2014.

Commodity
cost recovery -

The wholesale electric rates and retail gas rates of IPL
and WPL as well as the retail electric rates of IPL provide for subsequent
adjustments to rates for changes in prudently incurred commodity costs used to
serve customers.  The cumulative under/over collection of these
commodity costs are recorded as regulatory assets/liabilities until they are
automatically reflected in future billings to customers.  Refer to
Note 2 for discussion of certain rate refund reserves recorded as regulatory
liabilities on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to
the commodity cost recovery mechanism used to determine WPL’s retail electric
rates.

Derivatives
- -

IPL and WPL generally record unrealized gains from their derivative
instruments with offsets to regulatory liabilities based on their fuel and
natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, which require gains from derivative
instruments to be refunded to customers in the future when any gains are
realized.

(c)  Income
Taxes -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL follow the liability method of
accounting for deferred income taxes, which requires the establishment of
deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as appropriate, for temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements.  Deferred income
taxes are recorded using currently enacted tax rates.  Changes in
deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with certain
property-related basis differences at IPL are accounted for differently than
other subsidiaries of Alliant Energy as a result of rate making practices in
Iowa.  Deferred tax expense (benefit) is not recorded by IPL for
certain temporary differences (primarily related to utility property, plant and
equipment at IPL) because retail rates in Iowa only reflect the impact of
current tax expense (benefit).  As IPL’s deferred taxes become payable
(over periods exceeding 30 years for some generating plant differences) they are
recovered through retail rates.  Accordingly, IPL has recorded
deferred tax liabilities and regulatory assets for certain temporary
differences, as identified in Note 1(b).  In Wisconsin, the PSCW has
allowed rate recovery of deferred taxes on all temporary differences since
August 1991.

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL recognize positions taken, or expected to be taken, in
income tax returns that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, assuming that
the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all
relevant information.  If it is more-likely-than-not that a tax
position, or some portion thereof, will not be sustained, the related tax
benefits are not recognized in the financial statements.  For the
majority of uncertain tax positions, the ultimate deductibility is highly
certain, but there is uncertainty about the timing of such
deductibility.  Uncertain tax positions may result in an increase in
income taxes payable, a reduction of income tax refunds receivable or changes in
deferred taxes.  Also, when uncertainty about the deductibility of an
amount is limited to the timing of such deductibility, the increase in taxes
payable (or reduction in tax refunds receivable) is accompanied by a decrease in
deferred tax liabilities.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL recognize
current taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions in “Accrued taxes” and
non-current taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions in “Other long-term
liabilities and deferred credits” on their respective Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL recognize net interest and
penalties related to uncertain tax positions in “Income tax expense (benefit)”
in their respective Consolidated Statements of Income.  Refer to Note
5 for further discussion of uncertain tax positions.

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL defer investment tax credits and amortize the credits to
income over the average lives of the related property.  Other tax
credits for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL reduce income tax expense in the year
claimed.

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL have elected the alternative transition method to calculate
their beginning pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb any tax
deficiencies associated with recognition of share-based payment
awards.

(d)  Cash
and Cash Equivalents -

Cash
and cash equivalents include short-term liquid investments that have original
maturities of less than 90 days.  At Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, the
majority of Alliant Energy’s cash and cash equivalents were invested in money
market funds providing daily liquidity.  The yield on these funds can
fluctuate daily.  Information on Alliant Energy’s cash and cash
equivalents at Dec. 31 was as follows (dollars in millions):

(e)  Utility
Property, Plant and Equipment -

General

-

Utility plant in service (other than acquisition adjustments) is recorded
at the original cost of construction, which includes material, labor, contractor
services, AFUDC and allocable overheads, such as supervision, engineering,
benefits, certain taxes and transportation.  At Dec. 31, 2009 and
2008, IPL had $13.5 million and $14.7 million, respectively, of acquisition
adjustments, net of accumulated amortization, included in utility plant ($3.0
million and $3.2 million, respectively, of such balances are currently being
recovered in IPL’s rates).  Repairs, replacements and renewals of
items of property determined to be less than a unit of property or that do not
increase the property’s life or functionality are charged to maintenance
expense.  Ordinary retirements of utility plant and salvage value are
netted and charged to accumulated depreciation upon removal from utility plant
accounts and no gain or loss is recognized.  Removal costs incurred
are charged to a regulatory liability.

Wind
Generation Projects -

IPL’s
Whispering Willow Wind Project

- In 2007, IPL acquired approximately 500
MW of wind site capacity in Franklin County, Iowa referred to as the Whispering
Willow wind project.  The initial 200 MW of the wind project, referred
to as the Whispering Willow - East wind project, began commercial operation in
2009.  Future development of the balance of the wind project will
depend on numerous factors such as renewable portfolio standards, availability
of wind turbines and transmission capabilities.

In
February 2008, IPL received approval from the IUB to construct the initial 200
MW of the wind project.  The advanced rate making principles for this
project, as approved by the IUB in February 2008, included a predetermined
level, or “cost cap,” of $417 million for construction costs.  Final
construction costs for the project exceeded this cost cap.  Therefore,
IPL will be required to demonstrate the construction costs above the cost cap
are prudent and reasonable in order to recover the additional costs in future
electric rates.  Alliant Energy and IPL believe the construction costs
incurred for Whispering Willow - East through Dec. 31, 2009 are prudent and
reasonable.

As of
Dec. 31, 2009, IPL incurred construction costs of $466 million and recognized
AFUDC of $29 million related to the project.  The capitalized project
costs of $466 million were transferred from “Construction work in progress -
Whispering Willow - East wind project” to “Electric plant in service” on Alliant
Energy’s and IPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2009.  The
capitalized costs for the project are being depreciated using a straight-line
method of depreciation over a 25-year period.  Refer to Note 1(b) for
discussion of the regulatory liability established at the time of the DAEC sale,
a portion of which was used in 2009 to offset the Whispering Willow - East wind
project plant in service balance related to the $29 million of AFUDC recognized
for this project.  Refer to Note 18 for discussion of asset retirement
obligations recorded by IPL in 2009 related to its Whispering Willow - East wind
project.

As of
Dec. 31, 2009, IPL had $39 million recorded in “Other property, plant and
equipment” on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to
the remaining approximately 300 MW of site capacity for the Whispering Willow
wind project and an initial payment to Vestas-American Wind Technology, Inc.
(Vestas) for 100 MW of wind turbine generator sets and related
equipment.

WPL’s
Bent Tree Wind Project

-

In
March 2009, WPL acquired approximately 400 MW of wind site capacity in Freeborn
County, Minnesota, referred to as the Bent Tree wind project.  The
initial 200 MW of the wind project is expected to begin construction in
2010.  Future development of the balance of the wind project will
depend on numerous factors such as renewable portfolio standards, availability
of wind turbines and transmission capabilities.

In 2009,
WPL received approval from the MPUC and PSCW to construct the initial 200 MW of
the wind project.  The capitalized costs related to this 200 MW wind
project were transferred from “Other property, plant and equipment” to
“Construction work in progress - Bent Tree - Phase I wind project” on Alliant
Energy’s and WPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2009 upon receiving regulatory
approval for the project.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, WPL incurred costs of
$162 million and recognized $3 million of AFUDC related to the 200 MW wind
project.  The $162 million of incurred costs includes payments to
Vestas for 200 MW of wind turbine generator sets and related equipment and site
acquisition costs.


As of
Dec. 31, 2009, WPL’s capitalized costs related to the remaining approximately
200 MW of wind site capacity for the Bent Tree wind project were $14 million and
were recorded in “Other property, plant and equipment” on Alliant Energy’s and
WPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

WPL’s
Green Lake and Fond du Lac Counties Wind Site

- In March 2009, WPL
purchased development rights to an approximately 100 MW wind site in Green Lake
and Fond du Lac Counties in Wisconsin.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, WPL’s
capitalized costs related to this wind project were $5 million and were recorded
in “Other property, plant and equipment” on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

WPL’s
Acquisition of the Neenah Energy Facility -

In June 2009, WPL acquired a
300 MW, simple-cycle, dual-fueled (natural gas/diesel) electric generating
facility and related inventories (diesel fuel and materials and supplies)
located in Neenah, Wisconsin from Resources for $92 million.  The
purchase price was allocated to property, plant and equipment ($90 million),
production fuel ($1 million) and materials and supplies ($1 million) based on
the net book value of the assets acquired.  WPL’s acquisition of the
Neenah Energy Facility from Resources resulted in a $90 million decrease in
“Non-regulated Generation property, plant and equipment” and a $90 million
increase in “Electric plant in service” on Alliant Energy’s Consolidated Balance
Sheet in 2009.  The Neenah Energy Facility is being depreciated using
a group method of depreciation over a 30-year period.

WPL’s
Rock River and Blackhawk Generating Units -

In 2009, WPL ceased
operations and retired four of its gas-fired electric generating units know as
Rock River Units 1 and 2, and Blackhawk Units 3 and 4 to reduce operating
costs.  These retirements were recorded as reductions of $58 million
to “Electric plant in service” and “Utility accumulated depreciation” on Alliant
Energy’s and WPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2009.

IPL’s
Sixth Street Generating Station -

IPL’s Sixth Street Generating Station
was shut down in June 2008 as a result of significant damage caused by severe
flooding in downtown Cedar Rapids.  The Sixth Street Generating
Station was a facility that generated electricity and was also the primary
source of steam generating capability in downtown Cedar Rapids.  IPL
is currently evaluating the future viability of generating electricity at its
Sixth Street Generating Station.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy
and IPL had $48 million recorded in “Electric plant in service” and $20 million
recorded in “Utility accumulated depreciation” on their Consolidated Balance
Sheets related to the electric portion of IPL’s Sixth Street Generating
Station.

Depreciation

- -

IPL and WPL use a combination of remaining life and straight-line
depreciation methods as approved by their respective regulatory
commissions.  The composite or group method of depreciation is used,
in which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a
particular class of property.  This method pools similar assets and
then depreciates each group as a whole.  Periodic depreciation studies
are performed to determine the appropriate group lives, net salvage and group
deprecation rates.  These depreciation studies are subject to review
and approval by IPL’s and WPL’s respective regulatory
commissions.  Depreciation expense is included within the recoverable
cost of service component of rates charged to customers.  The average
rates of depreciation for electric and gas properties, consistent with current
rate making practices, were as follows:

IPL

WPL

Effective July 1,
      2008, WPL implemented updated depreciation rates as a result of a new
      depreciation study.  These updated depreciation rates increased
      Alliant Energy’s net income in 2008 as compared to 2007 by approximately
      $5.3 million, or $0.05 per share.

AFUDC

- -

AFUDC represents costs to finance construction additions including a
return on equity component and cost of debt component as required by regulatory
accounting.  The concurrent credit for the amount of AFUDC capitalized
is recorded as “Allowance for funds used during construction” in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.  The amount of AFUDC generated by
equity and debt components was as follows (in millions):

The
increase in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s AFUDC in 2009 and 2008 compared to 2007
was primarily due to AFUDC recognized in 2009 and 2008 for IPL’s Whispering
Willow - East wind project.  IPL’s Whispering Willow - East wind
project was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The
increase in WPL’s AFUDC in 2008 compared to 2009 and 2007 was primarily due to
AFUDC recognized in 2008 for WPL’s Cedar Ridge wind project.  WPL’s
Cedar Ridge wind project was placed in service in the fourth quarter of
2008.

In the
fourth quarter of 2009, Alliant Energy and IPL recorded an out-of-period
adjustment of $5.4 million to correct an error in IPL’s AFUDC calculation that
was immaterial to prior periods.  The $5.4 million reduction in AFUDC
in the fourth quarter of 2009 is comprised of the following impacts to prior
periods (in millions):

AFUDC for
IPL’s construction projects is calculated in accordance with FERC
guidelines.  AFUDC for WPL’s retail and wholesale jurisdiction
construction projects is calculated in accordance with PSCW and FERC guidelines,
respectively.  The AFUDC recovery rates, computed in accordance with
the prescribed regulatory formula, were as follows:

Consistent with the
      PSCW’s most recent retail rate case order issued in December 2009, WPL
      will earn a current return on 50% of the estimated CWIP related to its
      Bent Tree - Phase I wind project for 2010 and accrue AFUDC on the
      remaining 50% beginning Jan. 1, 2010.  In addition, the PSCW’s
      order changed WPL’s AFUDC recovery rate to 8.76% from 9.0% effective Jan.
      1, 2010.

(f)  Non-regulated
and Other Property, Plant and Equipment

- Non-regulated and other
property, plant and equipment is recorded at the original cost of construction,
which includes material, labor and contractor services.  Repairs,
replacements and renewals of items of property determined to be less than a unit
of property or that do not increase the property’s life or functionality are
charged to maintenance expense.  The Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility
within Alliant Energy’s Non-regulated Generation business represents a
significant portion of the non-regulated and other property, plant and equipment
and is being depreciated using the straight-line method over a 35-year
period.  The property, plant and equipment related to Corporate
Services, RMT, Transportation, Industrial Energy Applications, Inc. and other
non-regulated investments is depreciated using the straight-line method over
periods ranging from 5 to 30 years.  Upon retirement or sale of
non-regulated and other property, plant and equipment, the original cost and
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or
loss is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Refer to
Note 1(e) for discussion of WPL’s purchase of the Neenah Energy Facility from
Resources in June 2009.

(g)  Operating
Revenues -

Utility

- -

Revenues from Alliant Energy’s utility business are primarily from
electricity and natural gas sales and are recognized on an accrual basis as
services are rendered or commodities are delivered to customers.  IPL
and WPL recognize unbilled revenues based on estimated amounts of electricity
and natural gas delivered but not yet billed to customers at the end of each
reporting period.

IPL and
WPL participate in bid/offer-based wholesale energy and ancillary services
markets operated by MISO.  The markets require that all market
participants, including IPL and WPL, submit hourly day-ahead and/or real-time
bids and offers for energy and ancillary services at locations across the MISO
region.  The day-ahead and real-time transactions are grouped
together, resulting in a net supply to or net purchase from MISO of
megawatt-hours (MWhs) for each hour of each day.  The net supply to
MISO is recorded in “Electric operating revenues” and the net purchase from MISO
is recorded in “Electric production fuel and energy purchases” in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Non-regulated

- -

Revenues from Alliant Energy’s non-regulated businesses are primarily
from its RMT business and are recognized on an accrual basis based on services
provided as specified under contract terms.  Alliant Energy’s RMT
business accounts for revenues from certain large construction management
projects under the percentage of completion and cost-to-cost
methods.  Revenues from fixed-price and modified fixed-price
construction contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method,
measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the estimated total
costs for each contract.  This method is used because management
considers total costs to be the best available measure of progress on these
contracts.  Revenues from cost-plus-fee contracts are recognized on
the basis of costs incurred during the reporting period plus the fee earned,
measured by the cost-to-cost method.  Revenues from time-and-material
contracts are recognized in the period the work is performed.


Taxes
Collected from Customers

- -

Certain of Alliant Energy’s subsidiaries serve as collection agents for
sales or various other taxes and record revenues on a net
basis.  Operating revenues do not include the collection of the
aforementioned taxes.

(h)  Utility
Cost Recovery Mechanisms -

Electric
Production Fuel and Energy Purchases

-

IPL and WPL burn coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity at
their generating facilities to meet the demand of their customers and charge the
cost of fossil fuels used during each period to electric production fuel
expense.  IPL and WPL also purchase electricity to meet the demand of
their customers and charge these costs to energy purchases expense.

The
tariffs for IPL’s retail electric customers and IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale
electric customers provide for subsequent adjustments to their electric rates
for changes in electric production fuel and purchased energy
expenses.  Changes in the under/over collection of these expenses are
also recognized in electric production fuel and energy purchases
expense.  The cumulative effects of the under/over collection of these
costs are recorded in Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets as current regulatory assets or current regulatory liabilities until they
are reflected in future billings to customers.

WPL’s
retail electric rates approved by the PSCW are based on forecasts of
forward-looking test periods and include estimates of future electric production
fuel and purchased energy expenses (fuel-related costs) anticipated during the
test period.  During each electric retail rate proceeding, the PSCW
sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel-related costs used to
determine retail base rates.  If WPL’s actual fuel-related costs fall
outside these fuel monitoring ranges during the test period, WPL and/or other
parties can request, and the PSCW can authorize, an adjustment to future retail
electric rates based on changes in fuel-related costs only.  The PSCW
may authorize an interim retail rate increase.  However, if the final
retail rate increase is less than the interim retail rate increase, WPL must
refund the excess collection to retail customers with interest at the current
authorized return on common equity rate.

Purchased
Electric Capacity

-

IPL and WPL enter into purchased power agreements (PPAs) to help meet the
electricity demand of their customers.  Certain of these PPAs include
minimum payments for IPL’s and WPL’s rights to electric generating capacity,
which are charged to purchased electric capacity expense.  Purchased
electric capacity expenses are recovered from the retail electric customers of
IPL and WPL through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate
proceedings.  Purchased electric capacity expenses are recovered from
wholesale electric customers of IPL and WPL through annual changes in base rates
determined by a formula rate structure.

Electric
Transmission Service

-

IPL and WPL incur costs for the transmission of electricity to their
customers and charge these costs to electric transmission service
expense.  Electric transmission service expenses are recovered from
retail electric customers of IPL and WPL through changes in base rates
determined during periodic rate proceedings.  Electric transmission
service expenses are recovered from wholesale electric customers of IPL and WPL
through annual changes in base rates determined by a formula rate
structure.  Electric transmission service expenses for Alliant Energy
and IPL are significantly higher in 2009 and 2008 compared to 2007 due to
electric transmission service expenses billed to IPL by ITC following the sale
of IPL’s electric transmission assets to ITC in December 2007.

Cost
of Gas Sold

-

IPL and WPL incur costs for the purchase, transportation and storage of
natural gas to serve their gas customers and charge these costs to cost of gas
sold.  The tariffs for IPL’s and WPL’s retail gas customers provide
for subsequent adjustments to their rates for changes in the cost of gas
sold.  Changes in the under/over collection of these costs are also
recognized in cost of gas sold.  The cumulative effects of the
under/over collection of these costs are recorded in Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and
WPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as current regulatory assets or current
regulatory liabilities until they are reflected in future billings to
customers.

In 2007,
WPL had a gas performance incentive that included a sharing mechanism whereby
35% of gains or losses relative to current commodity prices and benchmarks were
retained by WPL, with 65% refunded to or recovered from
customers.  Effective Nov. 1, 2007, this gas performance incentive
sharing mechanism was terminated.  WPL’s gas performance incentive
sharing mechanism resulted in gains of $5 million recorded as “Gas operating
revenues” in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s Consolidated Statements of Income in
2007.

Refer to
Notes 1(b) and 2 for additional information regarding these utility cost
recovery mechanisms.


(i)  Financial
Instruments -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL periodically use financial
instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in certain commodity prices,
volatility in a portion of electricity and natural gas sales volumes due to
weather, transmission congestion costs, currency exchange rates and interest
rates.  The fair value of those financial instruments that are
determined to be derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Derivative instruments representing
unrealized gain positions are reported as derivative assets and derivative
instruments representing unrealized loss positions are reported as derivative
liabilities at the end of each reporting period.  Alliant Energy, IPL
and WPL also have certain commodity purchase and sales contracts that have been
designated, and qualify for, the normal purchase and sale exception and based on
this designation, these contracts are accounted for on the accrual basis of
accounting.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL do not offset fair value
amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (receivable) or the
obligation to return cash collateral (payable) against fair value amounts
recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under
the same master netting arrangement.  Refer to Note 1(b) for
discussion of the recognition of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities
related to the unrealized losses and unrealized gains on IPL’s and WPL’s
derivative instruments.  Refer to Notes 11 and 12(f) for further
discussion of derivatives and related credit risk, respectively.

(j)  Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans -

For
the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans sponsored by
Corporate Services, Alliant Energy allocates costs to IPL, WPL, Resources and
the parent company based on labor costs of plan participants.

(k)  Asset
Valuations -

Long-lived assets to be held and used, excluding regulatory
assets and goodwill, are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be
recoverable.  Impairment is indicated if the carrying value of an
asset exceeds its undiscounted future cash flows.  An impairment
charge is recognized equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the asset’s
fair value.  Refer to Note 1(b) for discussion of long-lived assets
classified as regulatory assets.

Goodwill
is subject to annual impairment tests, which are completed in the third quarter,
and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would
indicate goodwill might be impaired.  Refer to Note 15 for additional
discussion of goodwill.

If events
or circumstances indicate the carrying value of investments accounted for under
the equity method of accounting may not be recoverable, potential impairment is
assessed by comparing the fair value of these investments to their carrying
values as well as assessing if a decline in fair value is
temporary.  If an impairment is indicated, a charge is recognized
equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the investment’s fair
value.  Refer to Note 9(a) for additional discussion of investments
accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

(m)  Operating
Leases -

Alliant Energy has certain PPAs that provide Alliant Energy
exclusive rights to all or a substantial portion of the output from the specific
generating facility over the contract term and therefore are accounted for as
operating leases.  Costs associated with these PPAs are included in
“Electric production fuel and energy purchases” and “Purchased electric
capacity” in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s Consolidated Statements of Income based
on monthly payments for these PPAs.  Monthly capacity payments related
to one of these PPAs is higher during the peak demand period from May 1 through
Sep. 30 and lower in all other periods during each calendar
year.  These seasonal differences in capacity charges are consistent
with expected market pricing and the expected usage of energy from the
facility.


(n)  Emission
Allowances

- Emission allowances are granted by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) at zero cost and permit the holder of the allowances to
emit certain gaseous by-products of fossil fuel combustion, including SO2 and
NOx.  Unused emission allowances may be bought and sold or carried
forward to be utilized in future years.  Purchased emission allowances
are recorded as intangible assets at their original cost and evaluated for
impairment as long-lived assets to be held and used.  Emission
allowances allocated to or acquired by Alliant Energy, IPL or WPL are held
primarily for consumption.  Amortization of emission allowances is
based upon a weighted average cost for each category of vintage year utilized
during the reporting period and is recorded in “Electric production fuel and
energy purchases” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Cash
inflows and outflows related to sales and purchases of emission allowances are
recorded as investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.  Refer to Note 15 for additional discussion of emission
allowances and Note 1(b) for information regarding regulatory liabilities
related to emission allowances.

(o)  Cash
Flows Presentation -

Alliant Energy reports cash flows from continuing
operations together with cash flows from discontinued operations on its
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Refer to Note 17 for details
of cash flows from discontinued operations.

(p)  Asset
Retirement Obligations -

The fair value of any retirement costs
associated with an asset for which Alliant Energy has a legal obligation is
recorded as a liability with an equivalent amount added to the asset cost when
an asset is placed in service or when sufficient information becomes available
to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of future retirement
costs.  The fair value of asset retirement obligations is generally
determined using discounted cash flow analyses.  The liability is
accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is
depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.  For IPL and
WPL, accretion and depreciation expense related to their regulated operations is
recorded to regulatory assets on their respective Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  Upon settlement of the liability, an entity settles the
obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss.  For IPL
and WPL, any gain or loss related to their regulated operations is recorded to
regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets on their respective Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  Refer to Note 18 for additional discussion of asset
retirement obligations.

(q)  Debt
Issuance and Retirement Costs -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL defer and
amortize debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts over the expected
lives of the respective debt issues, considering maturity dates and, if
applicable, redemption rights held by others.  Alliant Energy’s
remaining businesses expense in the period of retirement any unamortized debt
issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts on debt retired
early.  Refer to Note 8(b) for details on Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and
WPL’s long-term debt and Note 1(b) for information on IPL’s and WPL’s regulatory
assets related to debt retired early or refinanced.

(r)  New
Accounting Pronouncements -

Fair
Value Measurements

In
February 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
authoritative guidance requiring fair value measurements and disclosures for all
nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and
liabilities.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL adopted this guidance on
Jan. 1, 2009 with no material impact on their financial condition and results of
operations.

In April
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for determining fair values when
there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent
distressed sales.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL adopted this clarifying
guidance on June 30, 2009 with no material impact on their financial condition
and results of operations.

In August
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance clarifying that the quoted price
for an identical liability, when traded as an asset in an active market, is also
a Level 1 measurement for that liability when no adjustment to the quoted price
is required.  In the absence of a Level 1 measurement, an entity must
use one or more of the following valuation techniques to estimate fair value,
which can be classified into two categories: 1) a valuation technique that uses
a quoted price; and 2) another valuation technique based on the amount an entity
would pay to transfer the identical liability or based on the amount an entity
would receive to enter into an identical liability.  Alliant Energy,
IPL and WPL adopted this guidance on Oct. 1, 2009 with no material impact on
their financial condition and results of operations.

Refer to
Note 10 for disclosures about fair value measurements.


Redeemable
Equity Instruments

In August
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring preferred securities that
are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent
equity if they are redeemable (1) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or
determinable date, (2) at the option of the holder, or (3) upon the occurrence
of an event that is not solely within the control of the
issuer.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL adopted this guidance in August
2009 with no material impact on their financial condition and results of
operations.  Refer to Note 7(b) for disclosures about redeemable
equity instruments.

Interest Entities (VIEs)

In June
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance changing the approach to determine
a VIE’s primary beneficiary and requiring ongoing assessments of whether an
enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  This guidance also
requires additional disclosures about a company’s involvement with VIEs and any
significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement.  Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL adopted this guidance on Jan. 1, 2010.  Prior to
the adoption of this guidance, special purpose entities were excluded from the
scope of the accounting guidance for VIEs.  Under this new guidance,
the scope exception for special purpose entities has been
eliminated.  IPL uses special purpose entities for its sales of
accounts receivable program.  If IPL sells any of its accounts
receivable in the future, the third-party financial institution that purchases
IPL’s receivables will require future evaluation to determine whether it
qualifies as a VIE and whether IPL is the primary beneficiary.  Refer
to Note 19 for disclosures about VIEs.

Transfers
of Financial Assets

In June
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring additional disclosures
about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and
where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred
financial assets.  This guidance also eliminates the concept of a
“qualifying special-purpose entity” and changes the requirements for
derecognizing financial assets.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL adopted
this guidance on Jan. 1, 2010.  Prior to the adoption of this
guidance, Alliant Energy and IPL accounted for transfers of financial assets
under IPL’s sale of accounts receivable program as sales of
receivables.  Under this new guidance, transfers of financial assets
under IPL’s current sale of accounts receivable program will be accounted for as
secured borrowings.  Refer to Note 4(a) for disclosures about
transfers of financial assets.

Subsequent
Events

In May
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance establishing general standards of
accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
but before financial statements are issued.  In particular, this
guidance sets forth: 1) the period after the balance sheet date during which
management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential
recognition or disclosure in the financial statements; 2) the circumstances
under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after
the balance sheet date in its financial statements; and 3) the disclosures that
an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the
balance sheet date.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL adopted this guidance
on June 30, 2009 with no material impact on their financial condition and
results of operations.

Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments

In April
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intending to bring greater
consistency to the timing of impairment recognition and provide greater clarity
to investors about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt
securities that are not expected to be sold.  This guidance requires
additional disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses and an aging
of securities with unrealized losses.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL
adopted this guidance on June 30, 2009 with no material impact on their
financial condition and results of operations.

Equity
Method Investments

In
November 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to address
questions that have arisen regarding the application of equity method accounting
guidance because of the significant changes to the guidance on business
combinations and subsidiary equity transactions and the increased use of fair
value measurements as a result of this guidance.  Alliant Energy, IPL
and WPL adopted this guidance prospectively for transactions occurring on or
after Jan. 1, 2009 with no material impact on their financial condition or
results of operations in 2009.  Because the provisions of this
guidance are only applied prospectively to transactions after adoption, the
impact to Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL cannot be determined until any such
transactions occur.  Refer to Note 9(a) for disclosures about equity
method investments.

Business
Combinations

In
December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance establishing principles
and requirements for how the acquiring entity in a business combination:
recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business
combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information
to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature
and financial effects of the business combination.  In April 2009, the
FASB issued revised authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize at
fair value an asset acquired or liability assumed in a business combination that
arises from a contingency if the acquisition-date fair value of that asset or
liability can be determined during the measurement period.  If the
acquisition-date fair value cannot be determined then the acquirer follows the
recognition criteria for contingencies to determine whether the contingency
should be recognized as of the acquisition date or after it.  Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL adopted this guidance prospectively for business
combinations occurring on or after Jan. 1, 2009 with no material impact on their
financial condition or results of operations in 2009.


Noncontrolling
Interests

In
December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance amending accounting and
reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary.  This guidance also clarifies that a
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the
consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated
financial statements.  This guidance also changes the way the
consolidated income statement is presented, establishes a single method of
accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do
not result in deconsolidation, requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss
in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated and requires expanded
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and
distinguish between the interests of the parent’s owners and the interests of
the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary.  Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL adopted this guidance on Jan. 1, 2009 with retrospective application of the
presentation and disclosure requirements.  Adoption of this guidance
had no material impact on their financial condition and results of
operations.  Refer to Note 7(c) for disclosures about noncontrolling
interests.

UTILITY RATE CASES

IPL’s
Iowa Retail Electric Rate Case (2008 Test Year)

-

In March 2009, IPL filed a request with the IUB to increase annual rates
for its Iowa retail electric customers.  The filing was based on a
2008 historical test year as adjusted for certain known and measurable changes
occurring up to 12 months after commencement of the proceeding.  In
conjunction with the filing, IPL implemented an interim retail electric rate
increase of $84 million, on an annual basis, effective in March 2009 without
regulatory review and subject to refund pending determination of final rates
from the request.  In January 2010, IPL received an order from the IUB
authorizing final rates equivalent to the interim rate increase.  As a
result, IPL did not record any rate refund reserves related to the interim rate
increase.  Refer to Note 1(b) for discussion of the IUB’s decision in
the January 2010 order allowing IPL to recover $8 million of flood-related costs
incurred in 2008 and to use regulatory liabilities to offset the recovery of $26
million of costs incurred for the cancelled Sutherland #4 base-load project and
$46 million of transmission costs expected to be billed to IPL in 2010 related
to ITC’s 2008 transmission revenue true-up adjustment.

WPL’s
Retail Rate Case (2010 Test Year)

-

In December 2009, WPL received an order from the PSCW authorizing an
annual retail electric rate increase of $59 million, or approximately 6%, and an
annual retail natural gas increase of $6 million, or approximately 2%, effective
January 2010.  Refer to Note 1(b) for discussion of the PSCW’s
decision in the December 2009 order regarding recovery of previously incurred
costs for the cancelled Nelson Dewey #3 base-load project.

WPL’s
Fuel-related Retail Rate Cases

- -

Retail fuel-related costs incurred by WPL in 2008 and 2007 were lower
than retail fuel-related costs used to determine rates during such periods
resulting in refunds owed to its retail electric customers.  In 2009,
WPL received approval from the PSCW to refund $23 million to its retail electric
customers in 2009 related to the 2008 fuel-related retail rate case and the
remaining $2 million of refunds to retail electric customers in 2009 related to
fuel-related costs in the 2007 retail rate case.  WPL completed these
refunds in 2009.

In August
2009, WPL notified the PSCW that its actual retail fuel-related costs incurred
during the month of July 2009 were below the monthly monitoring range of plus or
minus 8% and projected annual retail fuel-related costs for 2009 could fall
outside the annual monitoring range of plus or minus 2%.  In September
2009, the PSCW issued an order that set WPL’s retail electric fuel rates
currently in effect subject to refund beginning Sep. 1, 2009.  In
January 2010, WPL filed a retail electric fuel refund report indicating retail
fuel over collections of $4 million for the period from Sep. 1, 2009 through
Dec. 31, 2009.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, WPL reserved $4 million,
including interest, for refunds anticipated to be paid to its retail electric
customers.

Refer to
Note 1(h) for further discussion of WPL’s fuel cost recovery and Note 1(b) for
discussion of various other rate matters.

LEASES

(a)  Operating
Leases -

Alliant Energy has entered into various agreements related to
property, plant and equipment rights that are accounted for as operating
leases.  Alliant Energy’s most significant operating leases relate to
certain PPAs.  These PPAs contain fixed rental payments related to
capacity and contingent rental payments related to the energy portion (actual
MWhs) of the respective PPAs.  Rental expenses associated with Alliant
Energy’s operating leases were as follows (in millions):

      PPA.

(b)

The synthetic leases
      relate to the financing of certain corporate headquarters and utility
      railcars.  The entities that lease these assets to Alliant
      Energy do not meet consolidation requirements and are not included on
      Alliant Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Alliant Energy
      has guaranteed the residual value of the related assets, which total $48
      million in the aggregate.  The guarantees extend through the
      maturity of each respective underlying lease with remaining terms up to
      six years.  Residual value guarantee amounts have been included
      in the future minimum operating lease
payments.

(b)  Capital
Leases -

At Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, Alliant Energy’s gross assets under
its capital leases (excluding capital leases between related parties) were $8
million and $3 million, and the related accumulated amortization was $2 million
and $1 million, respectively.  At Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy’s

RECEIVABLES

(a)  Sales
of Accounts Receivable -

IPL participates in an accounts receivable sale
program whereby it may sell up to a maximum amount of $150 million of its
accounts receivable, including unbilled revenues, to a third-party financial
institution through wholly-owned and consolidated special purpose
entities.  Corporate Services acts as collection agent for the buyer
and receives a fee for collection services.  Under terms of the
agreement, the third-party financial institution purchases the receivables
initially for the face amount.  IPL makes monthly payments to the
third-party financial institution of an amount that varies based on interest
rates, the length of time the sold receivables remain outstanding and the total
amount under commitment by the third-party financial
institution.  Retained receivables are available to the third-party
financial institution to pay any fees or expenses due it, and to absorb all
credit losses incurred on any of the sold receivables.  The agreement
expires in March 2012.

At Dec.
31, 2009 and 2008, IPL had sold in the aggregate $0 and $25 million,
respectively, of accounts receivable.  IPL has historically used
proceeds from the sales of accounts receivable to maintain flexibility in its
capital structure, take advantage of favorable short-term rates and finance a
portion of its cash needs.  IPL’s average amount of aggregate accounts
receivable sold and costs incurred related to the sales of accounts receivable
program was as follows (in millions):

(b)  Whiting
Petroleum Corporation (WPC) Tax Sharing Agreement -

Prior to an initial
public offering (IPO) of WPC in 2003, Alliant Energy and WPC entered into a tax
separation and indemnification agreement pursuant to which Alliant Energy and
WPC made tax elections.  These tax elections had the effect of
increasing the tax basis of the assets of WPC’s consolidated tax group based on
the sales price of WPC’s shares in the IPO.  The increase in the tax
basis of the assets was included in income in Alliant Energy’s U.S. federal
income tax return for the calendar year 2003.  Pursuant to the tax
separation and indemnification agreement, WPC will be obligated to pay Resources
90% of any tax benefits realized annually due to the additional tax deductions
from the increase in tax basis for years ending on or prior to Dec. 31,
2013.  Such tax benefits will generally be calculated by comparing
WPC’s actual taxes to the taxes that would have been owed by WPC had the
increase in basis not occurred.  In 2014, WPC will be obligated to pay
Resources the present value of the remaining tax benefits assuming all such tax
benefits will be realized in future years.  At the IPO closing date,
Resources recorded a receivable from WPC based on the estimated present value of
the payments expected from WPC.  At Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, the
carrying value of this receivable was $25 million and $26 million,
respectively.  The current and non-current portions of this receivable
are recorded in “Other current assets” and “Deferred charges and other,”
respectively, on Alliant Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(c)  Property
Insurance Recoveries -

In June 2008, the Midwest experienced severe
flooding that impacted the operations of several Alliant Energy companies
including IPL, WPL and Resources.  The severe flooding resulted in
significant property damage, electric and steam service outages and the
evacuation of and damage to various office and operational
facilities.  Alliant Energy has a property insurance policy that
provides coverage up to $100 million for covered flood losses incurred by
various subsidiaries including IPL, WPL and Resources.  Alliant Energy
incurred covered flood losses related to the severe Midwest flooding in June
2008 that exceed the $100 million coverage limit under Alliant Energy’s property
insurance policy.  As a result, Alliant Energy received $100 million
of payments for reimbursement of covered flood losses under the property
insurance policy during 2009 and 2008.

Alliant
Energy and IPL recorded IPL’s portion of the proceeds as a $45 million ($27
million in 2009 and $18 million in 2008) decrease in “Utility other operation
and maintenance” in their Consolidated Statements of Income and a $54 million
($38 million in 2009 and $16 million in 2008) increase in “Utility accumulated
depreciation” on their Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the percentage of
covered flood losses charged to expense and capital accounts.  Alliant
Energy recorded Resources’ portion of the proceeds as a $1 million decrease in
“Non-regulated operation and maintenance” in its Consolidated Statement of
Income in 2008.

At Dec.
31, 2008, Alliant Energy and IPL recorded $26 million in “Accounts receivable -
other” on their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets related to operating
expenses incurred through Dec. 31, 2008 that were reimbursed with property
insurance payments in 2009.

(d)  Cash
Collateral -

As of Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, IPL, WPL and Corporate
Services had entered into numerous agreements to purchase electricity and
natural gas to serve IPL’s and WPL’s utility customers.  Exposure
under certain of these agreements exceeded contractual limits, requiring WPL and
Corporate Services to provide cash collateral to certain
counterparties.  The cash collateral was recorded in “Accounts
receivable - other” on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at
Dec. 31 as follows (in millions):

(e)  Advances
for Customer Energy Efficiency Projects

- WPL and IPL offer energy
efficiency programs to certain of their customers in Wisconsin and Minnesota,
respectively.  The energy efficiency programs provide low-cost
financing to help customers identify, purchase and install energy efficiency
improvement projects.  The customers repay WPL and IPL with monthly
payments over a term up to five years.  The advances for and
collections of customer energy efficiency projects are recorded as investing
activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The current
portion and non-current portion of outstanding advances for customer energy
efficiency projects are recorded in “Other accounts receivable” and “Deferred
charges and other,” respectively on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  At Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, IPL’s and WPL’s outstanding
advances for customer energy efficiency projects were as follows (in

State
filing changes -

In February 2009, the Wisconsin Senate Bill 62 (SB 62)
was enacted.  The most significant provision of SB 62 for Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL requires combined reporting for corporate income taxation in
Wisconsin beginning with tax returns filed for the calendar year
2009.  This provision requires all legal entities in which Alliant
Energy owns a 50% or more interest to file as members of a unitary return in
Wisconsin.  As a result of this provision in SB 62 and in order to
take advantage of efficiencies that may be available as a result of IPL and WPL
sharing resources and facilities, WPL plans to file as a member of Iowa
consolidated tax returns beginning with calendar year 2009.  Changes
in state apportioned income tax rates resulting from Wisconsin combined
reporting requirements and WPL’s plans to be included in Iowa consolidated tax
returns required Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL to adjust the carrying value of
their deferred income tax assets and liabilities in 2009.  Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL recognized net income tax benefits in 2009 of $40.4 million,
$32.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to these
impacts.  The provisions of SB 62 also make it unlikely that Alliant
Energy will be able to utilize the majority of its current Wisconsin net
operating loss carryforwards before they expire.  Therefore, the
valuation allowance related to the Wisconsin net operating loss carryforwards
was increased by $6 million in 2009.  Changes in state apportioned
income tax rates resulting from Wisconsin combined reporting requirements and
WPL’s plans to be included in Iowa consolidated tax returns also resulted in
reductions in the deferred tax assets for Wisconsin and Iowa capital loss
carryforwards and associated valuation allowances of $11 million in
2009.

IPL’s

electric
transmission assets sale

-

In 2007, Alliant Energy and IPL recorded $96 million of income tax
expense related to the $219 million pre-tax gain on the sale of IPL’s electric
transmission assets.  By closing the sale in 2007 and by meeting
certain other requirements, IPL qualifies to pay taxes related to the gain on
the sale ratably over an eight-year period.  As a result, a portion of
the income tax expense on the gain related to the sale was allocated to each of
the “Current tax expense (benefit)” lines and the “Deferred tax expense
(benefit)” lines in the 2007 column of the Income Tax Expense (Benefit) table
above.  Income tax expense related to the sale exceeded the statutory
federal income tax amount by $19.5 million due to $14.5 million of income tax
expense associated with property-related temporary differences for which
deferred tax expense was not recorded pursuant to Iowa rate making principles
plus $12.4 million of state income taxes related to the pre-tax gain less the
recognition of the unamortized balance of deferred investment tax credits of
$2.2 million and the reversal of $5.2 million of excess deferred taxes related
to the assets sold.  Refer to Notes 1(b) and 22 for further discussion
of IPL’s electric transmission assets sale.


Reversal
of capital loss valuation allowances -

In 2007, Alliant Energy recorded
the reversal of $6.4 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances
originally recorded in prior years related to a change in Alliant Energy’s
anticipated ability to utilize certain capital losses prior to their
expiration.  Alliant Energy has utilized all of its federal capital
losses and the majority of its Iowa capital losses.

Adjustment
of prior period taxes -

In 2008, Alliant Energy reached a settlement with
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which finalized the audit of Alliant
Energy’s U.S. federal income tax returns for calendar years 2002 through
2004.  As a result of completing the audit and recording known
adjustments for the tax return for calendar years 2005 through 2007, Alliant
Energy recorded net income tax benefits in 2008 of $12.1 million ($12.6 million
at IPL).  These income tax benefits decreased the effective income tax
rate by 2.8% and are included, along with other adjustments, in “Adjustment of
prior period taxes” in the 2008 column of the table above.

Deferred
Tax Assets and Liabilities

- -

Consistent with rate making treatment, deferred taxes are offset in the
table below for temporary differences which have related regulatory assets and
liabilities.  The deferred income tax (assets) and liabilities
included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at Dec. 31 arise from the following
temporary differences (in millions):

At Dec.

ranging from 2010 to 2030 with 93% expiring after 2015.  Due to the
uncertainty of the realization of certain tax carryforwards, Alliant Energy
established valuation allowances of $27 million as of Dec. 31,
2009.

Property
- -

The increases in deferred tax liabilities during 2009 were primarily
due to additional temporary differences resulting from bonus tax depreciation
deductions eligible for assets placed in service in 2009 under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), a recent change in method of
accounting for tax purposes related to repair expenditures and a difference
between the book and tax methods used to allocate flood insurance proceeds
received as a result of the severe flooding in IPL’s service territory in
2008.  The change in tax method of accounting for repairs expenditures
allows a current tax deduction for certain repair expenditures that are
capitalized for book purposes.  Flood insurance proceeds were
allocated solely to capital for tax purposes and split between capital and
expense for book purposes.  The change in tax method of accounting for
repairs expenditures and the tax method for allocating flood insurance proceeds
were included in the federal and state income tax returns for calendar year 2008
filed in the second half of 2009.

Deferred
portion of tax gain on retired Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2030 (Notes) -

Alliant Energy recognized a $152 million tax gain upon the retirement of
its Notes in 2009.  Under provisions of the ARRA, Alliant Energy can
defer its federal income tax obligation associated with the tax gain for five
years, with one-fifth of the federal income tax obligation being paid in each of
the years 2014 through 2018.  Refer to Note 8(b) for further
discussion of the retirement of the Notes.

Income
Tax Refunds Receivable

- -

In 2009, “Income tax refunds receivable” on Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and
WPL’s  Consolidated Balance Sheets increased $102 million, $55 million
and $73 million, respectively, primarily due to tax deductions for repair
expenditures discussed above and current deductions from bonus tax depreciation
in 2009.  Based on recent filings with the IRS and the state of Iowa,
$87 million of the income tax refund receivable is expected to be received in
the first half of 2010.

Uncertain
Tax Positions

- -

Alliant Energy adopted new authoritative guidance related to accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes on Jan. 1, 2007.  Alliant Energy’s
cumulative effect of the adoption was an increase in its net liability for
uncertain tax positions and a reduction to its Jan. 1, 2007 balance of retained
earnings of $0.5 million.

A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of uncertain tax positions,
excluding interest, for Alliant Energy for 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows (in

Reasonably
possible changes to uncertain tax positions in 2010 -

In 2010, statutes
of limitations will expire for Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s tax returns in
multiple state jurisdictions.  The impact of the statutes of
limitations expiring is not anticipated to be material.  In addition,
it is anticipated that Alliant Energy will finalize its U.S. federal income tax
audit for calendars years 2005 through 2008 in 2010 except for the audit of the
repairs expenditure change in method of tax accounting.  The federal
income tax return for calendar year 2009 is part of the Compliance Assurance
Program of the IRS and as a result, the audit of such return is anticipated to
be completed by the end of 2010.  Based on the anticipated timing of
completing these audits, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have recognized $30
million, $24 million and $5 million respectively, in “Accrued taxes” on their
Consolidated Balance Sheets for the expected resolution of a portion of their
uncertain tax positions in 2010 primarily related to the capitalization and
dispositions of property.

Regulatory
Assets and Liabilities

- -

Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with
certain property-related basis differences at IPL are accounted for differently
than most companies as a result of rate making practices in
Iowa.  Deferred tax expense (benefit) is not recorded for certain
temporary differences (primarily related to utility property, plant and
equipment at IPL) because retail rates in Iowa only reflect the impact of
current tax expense (benefit).  In 2009, IPL recognized significant
tax benefits as a result of a change in tax accounting method for repairs
expenditures and the tax method for allocating flood insurance
proceeds.  IPL expects to refund any tax benefits realized from these
items to its Iowa retail customers in the future following finalization of the
IRS audit of these items based on a method to be prescribed by the
IUB.  Because IPL expects to refund the tax benefits realized from
these items to its Iowa retail customers in the future, Alliant Energy and IPL
recorded an increase to their non-current regulatory liabilities of $162 million
in 2009.  Alliant Energy and IPL also recorded a comparable increase
to their non-current regulatory assets in 2009 to reflect the benefit IPL
expects to receive from its Iowa retail customers in the future as the temporary
differences associated with the repairs expenditures and flood insurance
proceeds reverse into current tax expense.

Other
Income Tax Matters

- -

Alliant Energy files a consolidated federal income tax return, which
includes the aggregate taxable income or loss of Alliant Energy and its
subsidiaries.  In addition, a combined return including Alliant Energy
and all of its subsidiaries will be filed in Wisconsin beginning with the tax
return for calendar year 2009.  Alliant Energy subsidiaries with a
presence in Iowa file as part of a consolidated return in Iowa.  Under
the terms of a tax sharing agreement signed in 2009 between Alliant Energy and
its subsidiaries, the subsidiaries now calculate state income tax using
consolidated apportionment rates applied to separate company taxable
income.  Prior to 2009, Alliant Energy’s subsidiaries calculated
income tax provisions using the separate return methodology.  Separate
return amounts prior to 2009 were adjusted for state apportionment benefits, net
of federal tax with any difference between the separate return methodology and
the actual consolidated return allocated as prescribed in the prior tax
allocation agreement.  In 2009, 2008 and 2007, Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s
and WPL’s foreign sources of income were not material.

BENEFIT PLANS

(a)  Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL
provide retirement benefits to substantially all of their employees through
various non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution
plans (401(k) savings plans).  Benefits of the non-contributory
defined benefit pension plans are based on the plan participant’s years of
service, age and compensation.  Benefits of the defined contribution
plans are based on the plan participant’s years of service, age, compensation
and contributions.  Alliant Energy also provides certain defined
benefit postretirement health care and life benefits to eligible
retirees.  In general, the health care plans are contributory with
participants’ contributions adjusted regularly and the life insurance plans are
non-contributory.

Assumptions

- - The assumptions for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement
benefits plans at the measurement dates of Dec. 31, 2009, Dec. 31, 2008 and Sep.

Expected
rate of return on plan assets -

The expected rate of return on plan
assets is determined by analysis of projected asset class returns based on the
target asset class allocations.  Alliant Energy uses a portfolio
return simulator and also reviews historical returns, survey information and
capital market information to support the expected rate of return on plan assets
assumption.  Refer to “Investment Policy and Strategy for Plan Assets”
below for additional information related to Alliant Energy’s investment policy
and strategy and mix of assets for the pension and other postretirement benefits
plans.

Medical
cost trend on covered charges -

The assumed medical trend rates are
critical assumptions in determining the service and interest cost and
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to postretirement benefits
costs.  A 1% change in the medical trend rates for 2009, holding all
other assumptions constant, would have the following effects (in

Measurement
dates -

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance
requiring an employer to measure benefit plan assets and obligations as of the
end of its fiscal year.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL adopted this
guidance in 2008 and changed their measurement date from Sep. 30 to Dec. 31,
which resulted in reductions to their Jan. 1, 2008 balance of retained earnings
of $2.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively.

      2012.

(c)

In 2007, members of
      the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 965 ratified a
      four-year collective bargaining agreement reached with WPL, resulting in
      changes to WPL’s qualified pension plan (Plan).  One of these
      changes provided Plan participants a one-time option to cease
      participating in the Plan and begin participating in the Alliant Energy
      401(k) Savings Plan with increased levels of contribution by Alliant
      Energy.  The election of this option did not impact a
      participant’s eligibility for benefits previously vested under the
      Plan.  In 2009, certain of these employees elected to cease
      participating in the Plan, resulting in Alliant Energy and WPL recognizing
      a one-time curtailment loss related to the Plan of $0.7 million in
      2009.


(d)

In 2009, Alliant
      Energy eliminated certain corporate and operations
      positions.  As a result, Alliant Energy recognized one-time
      curtailment losses and special termination benefits costs related to its
      pension plans of $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in
      2009.

Investment
Policy and Strategy for Plan Assets

-

Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s investment strategy and their policies
employed with respect to assets of defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefits plans are to combine both preservation of principal and
prudent and reasonable risk-taking to protect the integrity of plan assets, in
order to meet the obligations to plan participants while achieving the optimal
return possible over the long-term to minimize benefit costs.  It is
recognized that risk and volatility are present to some degree with all types of
investments; however, high levels of risk are minimized at the total fund
level.  This is accomplished through diversification by asset class
including both U.S. and international equity exposure, the number of individual
investments, and sector and industry limits when applicable.  Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL believe that any risk associated with the various plan
assets is minimized by this diversification.  Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL also use an overlay management service to help maintain target allocations,
liquidity needs and intended exposures to the plan assets.  The
overlay manager is authorized to use derivative financial instruments to
facilitate this service.


For
assets of defined benefit pension plans, the mix among asset classes is
controlled by long-term asset allocation targets.  The assets are
viewed as long-term with moderate liquidity needs.  Historical
performance results and future expectations suggest that equity securities will
provide higher total investment returns than debt securities over a long-term
investment horizon.  Consistent with the goals of maximizing returns
and minimizing risks over the long-term, the defined benefit pension plans have
a long-term investment posture more heavily weighted towards equity
holdings.  The current target range allocations for defined benefit
pension plan assets are 60-80% equity securities and 20-40% fixed income
securities.  Equity holdings include investments in large-cap (26-52%
target range), small-cap (0-10% target range) and international securities
(12-30% target range).  Fixed income holdings include corporate bonds,
government and government agency obligations and fixed income
funds.  The asset allocation mix is monitored regularly and
appropriate action is taken as needed to rebalance the assets within the
prescribed range.  Prohibited investment vehicles include, but may not
be limited to, direct ownership of real estate, options and futures (unless
specifically approved as is the case of the overlay manager), margin trading,
oil and gas limited partnerships, commodities, short selling and securities of
the managers’ firms or affiliate firms.

Other
postretirement benefits plans assets are comprised of specific assets within
certain defined benefit pension plans (401(h) assets) as well as assets held in
Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts.  The
investment policy and strategy of the 401(h) assets mirrors those of the defined
benefit pension plans, which is discussed above.  The assets in the
VEBA trusts are viewed as long-term.  A mix of both equity and debt
securities are utilized to maximize returns and minimize risk over the
long-term.  Equity holdings within the VEBA trusts include investments
in large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap securities.  Fixed income holdings
within the VEBA trusts include corporate bonds, government and agency
obligations and fixed income funds.  There are no specific target
allocations for the VEBA trusts as a whole.  Separate investment
guidelines have been established for the VEBA trusts which are actively
managed.  At Dec. 31, 2009, the other postretirement benefits plan
assets consisted of 59% equity securities and 31% fixed income
securities.

Securities
Lending Program

- Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have a securities lending
program with the trustee that allows the trustee to lend certain securities from
their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans to
selected entities against receipt of collateral (in the form of cash, government
securities or letters of credit) as provided for and determined in accordance
with its securities loan agreement.  Initial collateral levels are no
less than 102% and 105% of the market value of the borrowed securities for
collateral denominated in U.S. and foreign currency, respectively.  At
Dec. 31, 2009, the fair value of the collateral and the amount due to borrowers
for the securities lending program was as follows (in millions):

Fair
Value Measurements

-

The following tables report a framework for measuring fair
value.  The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value.  The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy are as follows:

Level

- Pricing inputs are unadjusted quoted prices available in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting
date.  Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s investments in registered
investment companies and common and preferred stocks are valued at the closing
price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are
traded.  Level 1 plan assets also include interest-bearing cash, which
is held in money market accounts managed by an affiliate of the
trustee.

Level

- Pricing inputs are quoted prices for similar asset or liabilities in
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated
by observable market data by correlation or other means.  Alliant
Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s investments in corporate bonds and government and
agency obligations are valued at the closing price reported in the active market
for similar assets in which the individual securities are traded or based on
yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar
credit ratings.  Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s investments in
common/collective trusts are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the
plans, which is based on the fair market value of the underlying investments in
equity and fixed income securities of the common/collective
trusts.  Level 2 plan assets also consist of asset backed securities,
certificates of deposit, commercial paper and repurchase agreements within their
securities lending invested collateral.

Level

- Pricing inputs are unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities for
which little or no market data exist and require significant management judgment
or estimation.  Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s Level 3 plan assets
include certain asset backed securities and corporate bonds within their
securities lending invested collateral.


The fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level
3).  In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall
in different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  The lowest level
input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines
the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy.  Assessing the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or
liability.

The
methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be
indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair
values.  Furthermore, while Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe their
valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants,
the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement
at the reporting date.

plans, Alliant Energy common stock represented less than 1% of total plan assets
at Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008.

Cash
Balance Pension Plan

-

Alliant Energy’s defined benefit pension plans include a cash balance
plan that provides benefits for substantially all of its non-bargaining unit
employees.  Effective August 2008, Alliant Energy amended the cash
balance plan by discontinuing additional contributions into employees’ cash
balance plan accounts.  Also effective August 2008, Alliant Energy
increased its level of contributions to its 401(k) Savings Plan, which offset
the impact of discontinuing additional contributions into the employees’ cash
balance plan accounts.  These amendments are designed to provide
employees portability and self-directed flexibility of their retirement
benefits.  These changes did not have a significant impact on Alliant
Energy’s results of operations.  Refer to Note 12(c) for discussion of
a class action lawsuit filed against the Alliant Energy Cash Balance Pension
Plan in 2008 and the IRS review of the tax qualified status of the
Plan.

In 2009,
Alliant Energy amended the cash balance plan by changing the participants’
future interest credit formula to use the annual change in consumer price index
as the interest credit.  This amendment is designed to provide
participants an interest crediting rate that will always be 3% more than the
annual change in the cost of living.


401(k)
Savings Plans

-

A significant number of Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL employees participate
in defined contribution retirement plans (401(k) Savings Plans), of which
Alliant Energy common stock represented 13.5% and 18.1% of total plan assets at
Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and
WPL’s contributions to the 401(k) plans, which are partially based on the
participants’ level of contribution, were as follows (in millions):

(b)  Equity
Incentive Plans -

Alliant Energy’s 2002 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP)
permits the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
shares and performance units to key employees.  At Dec. 31, 2009,
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and performance shares were
outstanding under the EIP and a predecessor plan under which new awards can no
longer be granted.  At Dec. 31, 2009, 2.5 million shares remained
available for grants under the EIP.  Alliant Energy satisfies payouts
related to equity awards under the EIP through the issuance of new shares of its
common stock.

In
February 2010, Alliant Energy’s Board of Directors adopted the Alliant Energy
2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (OIP), which permits the grant of incentive stock
options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance shares, performance units and other stock-based awards to key
employees.  The OIP would authorize issuance of 4,500,000 shares,
would terminate the EIP and is subject to shareowner approval.  If
shareowners do not approve the OIP, the EIP will remain effective.

A summary
of share-based compensation expense related to grants under the EIP and the
related income tax benefits recognized was as follows (in
millions):

As of
Dec. 31, 2009, total unrecognized compensation cost related to all share-based
compensation awards was $9.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of two years.  Share-based compensation
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
periods.

Performance
Shares

-

Performance share payouts to key employees are contingent upon
achievement over three-year periods of specified performance criteria, which
currently include metrics of total shareowner return relative to an
investor-owned utility peer group.  Nonvested performance share
payouts are prorated at retirement, death, disability or involuntary termination
without cause based on time worked during the performance period and achievement
of the performance criteria.  Participants’ nonvested performance
shares are forfeited if the participant voluntarily leaves Alliant Energy or is
terminated for cause.  Performance shares can be paid out in shares of
Alliant Energy’s common stock, cash or a combination of cash and stock and are
adjusted by a performance multiplier, which ranges from zero to 200% based on
the performance criteria.  Alliant Energy anticipates making future
payouts of its performance shares in cash; therefore, performance shares were
accounted for as liability awards at Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008.  A
summary of the performance shares activity was as follows:

At Dec.
31, 2009, fair values of nonvested performance shares were calculated using a
Monte Carlo simulation to determine the anticipated total shareowner returns of
Alliant Energy and its investor-owned utility peer group.  Expected
volatility was based on historical volatilities using daily stock prices over
the past three years.  Expected dividend yields were calculated based
on the most recent quarterly dividend rates announced prior to the measurement
date and stock prices at the measurement date.  The risk-free interest
rate was based on the three-year U.S. Treasury rate in effect as of the
measurement date.

In 2009,
2008 and 2007, Alliant Energy’s performance share payouts were valued at $4.1
million, $5.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively, and consisted of a
combination of cash and common stock (51,189 shares, 3,835 shares and 8,641
shares, respectively).

Restricted
Stock

-

Restricted stock issued under the EIP consists of time-based and
performance-contingent restricted stock.

Time-based
restricted stock

- Restriction periods vary for each issuance of
time-based restricted stock and currently range from three to five
years.  Nonvested shares of time-based restricted stock generally
become vested upon retirement, except for certain shares that were awarded for
retention purposes that are forfeited per specific
terms.  Compensation costs related to awards granted to
retirement-eligible employees are generally expensed on the date of
grant.  Participants’ nonvested time-based restricted stock is
forfeited if the participant voluntarily leaves Alliant Energy or is terminated
for cause.  Nonvested time-based restricted stock is fully vested in
the event of retirement, death, disability or involuntary termination without
cause.  The fair value of time-based restricted stock is based on the
average market price at the grant date.  A summary of the time-based
restricted stock activity was as follows:

Performance-contingent
restricted stock

- Vesting of performance-contingent restricted stock
grants are based on the achievement of certain performance targets (currently
specified earnings growth).  The performance metric for the 2009 and
2008 grants is consolidated net income growth.  The performance metric
for the 2007 grants is consolidated earnings per share growth.  If
performance targets are not met within the performance period, which currently
ranges from two to four years, these restricted stock grants are
forfeited.  Nonvested shares of performance-contingent restricted
stock are prorated at retirement based on time worked during the performance
period and vest only if and when the performance criteria are
met.  Participants’ nonvested performance-contingent restricted stock
is forfeited if the participant voluntarily leaves Alliant Energy for reasons
other than retirement.  The fair value of performance-contingent
restricted stock is based on the average market price at the grant
date.  A summary of the performance-contingent restricted stock
activity was as follows:


Non-qualified
Stock Options

- -

Options granted to date under the plans were granted at the market
price of the shares on the date of grant, vest over three years and expire no
later than 10 years after the grant date.  Options become fully vested
upon retirement and remain exercisable at any time prior to their expiration
date or for three years after the effective date of the retirement, whichever
period is shorter.  Options become fully vested upon death or
disability and remain exercisable at any time prior to their expiration date or
for one year after the effective date of the death or disability, whichever
period is shorter. Participants’ options that are not vested are forfeited if
participants leave Alliant Energy for reasons other than retirement, death or
disability, and their vested options expire three months after their
departure.  Alliant Energy has not granted any options since
2004.  A summary of the stock option activity was as
follows:

The
weighted average remaining contractual term for options outstanding and
exercisable at Dec. 31, 2009 was two years.  The aggregate intrinsic
value of options outstanding and exercisable at Dec. 31, 2009 was $1.4
million.

(c)  Deferred
Compensation Plan -

Alliant Energy maintains a deferred compensation plan
under which key employees may defer up to 100% of base salary and incentive
compensation and directors may elect to defer all or part of their retainer and
committee fees.  Key employees who have made the maximum allowed
contribution to the Alliant Energy 401(k) Savings Plan may receive an additional
credit to the deferred compensation plan.  Key employees and directors
may elect to have their deferrals credited to an interest account, an equity
account based on an S&P 500 index fund or a company stock
account.  The company stock account is held in a rabbi
trust.  Payments from the company stock account will be made in shares
of Alliant Energy common stock.  At Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair
market value of the company stock accounts, which are currently funded with
shares held in a deferred compensation trust, totaled $7.9 million and $7.0
million, respectively.

Shareowner
Rights Agreement

-

Alliant Energy has established an amended and restated Shareowner Rights
Agreement.  The rights under this agreement will only become
exercisable if a person or group has acquired, or announced an intention to
acquire, 15% or more of Alliant Energy’s outstanding common
stock.  Each right will initially entitle registered shareowners to
purchase from Alliant Energy one-half of one share of Alliant Energy’s common
stock.  The rights will be exercisable at an initial price of $110.00
per full share, subject to adjustment.  If any shareowner acquires 15%
or more of the outstanding common stock of Alliant Energy, each right (subject
to limitations) will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right’s then current
exercise price, a number of common shares of Alliant Energy or of the acquirer
having a market value at the time of twice the right’s per full share exercise
price.  The Board of Directors is authorized to reduce the 15%
ownership threshold to not less than 10%.  The amended and restated
Shareowner Rights Agreement expires in December 2018.

Dividend
Restrictions

-

Alliant Energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its
own therefore Alliant Energy is dependent upon receiving dividends from its
subsidiaries to pay dividends to its shareowners.  Alliant Energy does
not have any significant common stock dividend restrictions.  IPL and
WPL each have common stock dividend restrictions based on the terms of their
outstanding preferred stock and applicable regulatory limitations.  At
Dec. 31, 2009, IPL and WPL were in compliance with all such dividend
restrictions.

Both IPL
and WPL are restricted from paying common stock dividends to their parent
company, Alliant Energy, if for any past or current dividend period, dividends
on their respective preferred stock have not been paid, or declared and set
apart for payment.  IPL and WPL have paid all dividends on their
respective preferred stock through 2009.

IPL’s
most significant regulatory limitation on distributions to its parent company is
included in an order issued by the MPUC in June 2009 that requires IPL to
maintain a common stock equity ratio between 41.3% and 50.5% during the 12
months ended June 30, 2010.  In addition, IPL must inform the IUB if
its common equity ratio falls below 42% of total capitalization.  As
of Dec. 31, 2009, IPL’s amount of retained earnings that were free of
restrictions was $250 million.

WPL’s
most significant regulatory limitation on distributions to its parent company is
included in an order issued by the PSCW in December 2009 that prohibits WPL from
paying annual common stock dividends in excess of $112 million if WPL’s common
stock equity ratio is or will fall below 51.01%.  WPL’s dividends are
also restricted to the extent that such dividend would reduce WPL’s common stock
equity ratio to less than 25%.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, WPL’s amount of
retained earnings that were free of restrictions was $118 million.

Restricted
Net Assets of Subsidiaries

-

Neither IPL nor WPL have regulatory authority to lend or advance any
amounts to their parent company.  As of Dec. 31, the amount of net
assets of IPL and WPL that were not available to be transferred to their parent
company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without the consent of
IPL’s and WPL’s regulatory authorities was as follows (in

stock dividends to its parent included a $100 million dividend to realign WPL’s
capital structure.  In July 2008, FERC issued an order allowing IPL to
pay up to $400 million in common equity distributions from additional paid-in
capital, rather than retained earnings.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, IPL’s
remaining authority under this FERC order was $219 million.

- -

The articles of incorporation of IPL contain a provision that grants
the holders of its preferred stock voting rights to elect two members of IPL’s
Board of Directors if preferred dividends equal to the annual dividend
requirements are in arrears.  Such voting rights would not provide the
holders of IPL’s preferred stock control of the decision on redemption of IPL’s
preferred stock and could not force IPL to exercise its call
option.  Therefore, IPL’s preferred stock is presented in total equity
in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in a manner consistent
with noncontrolling interests.

WPL -

The articles of incorporation of WPL contain a provision that grants the
holders of its preferred stock voting rights to elect a majority of WPL’s Board
of Directors if preferred dividends equal to the annual dividend requirements
are in arrears.  The exercise of such voting rights would provide the
holders of WPL’s preferred stock control of the decision on redemption of WPL’s
preferred stock and could force WPL to exercise its call
option.  Therefore, the contingent control right and the embedded call
option cause WPL’s preferred stock to be presented outside of total equity in
Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in a manner consistent
with temporary equity.

(b)  Long-Term
Debt -

Alliant
Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s long-term debt, net as of Dec. 31 was as follows
(dollars in millions):


(a)

In July 2009, IPL
      issued $300 million of 6.25% senior debentures due 2039 and used the
      proceeds initially to repay short-term debt and invest in short-term
      assets and thereafter to repay $135 million of its 6.625% senior
      debentures in August 2009.

(b)

In July 2009, WPL
      issued $250 million of 5% debentures due 2019 and used the proceeds
      initially to repay short-term debt and invest in short-term assets, and
      thereafter to fund capital expenditures and for general working capital
      purposes.

(c)

In October 2009,
      Alliant Energy issued $250 million of 4% senior notes due 2014 and used
      the proceeds to repay short-term debt and the remainder for general
      corporate purposes.

(d)

In September 2009,
      Alliant Energy announced a tender offer and consent solicitation for all
      5,940,960 of its 2.5% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2030
      (Notes).  In 2009, Alliant Energy received valid tenders and
      consents from holders of 5,940,660 Notes and made $241 million of payments
      related to the Notes tendered using short-term borrowings and cash on
      hand.  These payments exceeded the carrying value of the Notes
      tendered resulting in Alliant Energy incurring $203 million of pre-tax
      charges in 2009 related to the repurchase of the Notes.  These
      pre-tax charges were recorded in “Loss on early extinguishment of debt” in
      Alliant Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Income in 2009.  As
      of Dec. 31, 2009, there were 300 Notes
  outstanding.

Five-Year
Schedule of Debt Maturities

- At Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s

Sheets.

Indentures

- - Alliant Energy maintains separate indentures related to its 4% senior notes
due 2014 and its 2.5% Notes.  IPL maintains indentures related to its
senior debentures due 2011 through 2039.  WPL maintains an indenture
related to its debentures due 2010 through 2038.  Sheboygan Power,
LLC, Resources’ wholly-owned subsidiary, maintains an indenture related to the
issuance of its 5.06% senior secured notes due 2010 to 2024.

Exchangeable
Senior Notes due 2030 -

As a result of receiving the requisite consents
in 2009 constituting a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes, Alliant Energy and the trustee for the Notes entered into a Sixth
Supplemental Indenture that (i) waived an alleged default under the indenture
for the Notes asserted in a notice of default from the trustee and its
consequences; (ii) rescinded the notice of acceleration from the trustee, which
declared the full principal amount of the Notes due and payable, and its
consequences; (iii) stipulated that Alliant Energy’s assumption of the
obligations of Resources under the indenture and the Notes and Resources’
release from its obligations under the indenture and the Notes were deemed to
have been effective on Nov. 25, 2008; (iv) authorized the filing of a
stipulation of dismissal with prejudice in federal court with respect to related
litigation by the trustee with respect to the Notes; and (v) approved amendments
to the indenture that eliminated substantially all of the covenants and certain
of the events of default contained in the indenture.  The Sixth
Supplemental Indenture provisions described above became operative in September
2009.  In September 2009, Alliant Energy, Resources and the trustee
filed in federal court the stipulation of dismissal, which ended the litigation
by the trustee with respect to the Notes.

Optional
Redemption Provisions -

Alliant Energy and its subsidiaries have certain
issuances of long-term debt that contain optional redemption provisions which,
if elected by the issuer at its sole discretion, could require material
redemption premium payments by the issuer.  The redemption premium
payments under these optional redemption provisions are variable and dependent
on applicable U.S. Treasury rates at the time of redemption.  At Dec.
31, 2009, the debt issuances that contained these optional redemption provisions
included Alliant Energy’s senior notes due 2014, IPL’s senior debentures due
2011 through 2039, WPL’s debentures due 2019 through 2038 and Sheboygan Power,
LLC’s senior secured notes due 2010 to 2024.

Security
Provisions -

The 5.06% senior secured notes due 2010 to 2024 are secured
by the Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility and related assets.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

-

The carrying amounts of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s current assets
and current liabilities approximates fair value because of the short maturity of
such financial instruments.  Carrying amounts and the related
estimated fair values of other financial instruments at Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008
are as follows (in millions):


Valuation
Techniques

-

Derivative
assets and liabilities -

Derivative assets and liabilities include swap
contracts, option contracts and physical forward purchase and sale contracts for
electricity and natural gas, financial transmission rights (FTRs) and embedded
foreign currency derivatives.  IPL’s and WPL’s swap, option and
physical forward commodity contracts are non-exchange-based derivative
instruments valued using indicative price quotations available through a pricing
vendor that provides daily exchange forward price settlements, from broker or
dealer quotations or from on-line exchanges.  The indicative price
quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and are obtained
from sources believed to provide the most liquid market for the
commodity.  IPL and WPL corroborate a portion of these indicative
price quotations using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets and categorize derivative instruments based on such indicative price
quotations as Level 2.  IPL’s and WPL’s commodity contracts that are
valued using indicative price quotations based on significant assumptions such
as seasonal or monthly shaping and indicative price quotations that cannot be
readily corroborated are categorized as Level 3.  IPL’s and WPL’s
swap, option and physical forward commodity contracts are predominately at
liquid trading points.  IPL’s and WPL’s FTRs are measured at fair
value each reporting period using monthly or annual auction shadow prices from
relevant auctions.  The embedded foreign currency derivatives related
to Euro-denominated payment terms included in the wind turbine supply contract
with Vestas are measured at fair value each reporting period using an
extrapolation of forward currency rates.  Refer to Note 11(a) for
additional details of Alliant Energy’s derivative assets and
liabilities.

Available-for-sale
securities -

The fair value of Resources’ investment in Capstone Turbine
Corporation’s common stock and certain IPL investments in various debt and
equity securities are measured at fair value each reporting period using quoted
market prices on listed exchanges.  Refer to Note 9(c) for additional
details of Alliant Energy’s available-for-sale securities.

Long-term
debt (including current maturities) -

For long-term debt instruments that
are actively traded, the fair value was based upon quoted market prices each
year-end.  For long-term debt instruments that are not actively
traded, the fair value was based on discounted cash flow methodology and
utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves.  Refer to Note
8(b) for additional details of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s long-term
debt.

Cumulative
preferred stock of subsidiaries -

The fair values of IPL’s 8.375% and
7.10% cumulative preferred stock were based on their closing market prices
quoted by the New York Stock Exchange each reporting period.  The fair
value of WPL’s 4.50% cumulative preferred stock was based on the closing market
prices quoted by the NYSE Amex LLC each reporting period.  The fair
value of WPL’s remaining preferred stock was calculated based on the market
yield of similar securities.  Refer to Note 7(b) for additional
details of IPL’s and WPL’s cumulative preferred stock of
subsidiaries.


Valuation
Hierarchy

-

Fair value measurement accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy and examples of
each are as follows:

Level 1
- -

Pricing inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  Level 1
assets include Resources’ investment in Capstone Turbine Corporation’s common
stock and certain IPL investments in securities valued using quoted market
prices on listed exchanges.

Level 2
- -

Pricing inputs are quoted prices for similar asset or liabilities in
active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active as of the reporting date.  Level 2
assets and liabilities include IPL’s and WPL’s non-exchange traded commodity
contracts valued using indicative price quotations that are corroborated with
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 3
- -

Pricing inputs are unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities for
which little or no market data exist and require significant management judgment
or estimation.  Level 3 assets and liabilities include IPL’s and WPL’s
FTRs, natural gas option contracts, embedded foreign currency derivatives and
certain commodity contracts that are valued using indicative price quotations
based on significant assumptions such as seasonal or monthly
shaping.

The fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets
(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3).  In
some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels
of the fair value hierarchy.  The lowest level input that is
significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the
applicable level in the fair value hierarchy.  Assessing the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or
liability.

In the
second quarter of 2009, IPL announced its decision to discontinue providing
steam service to customers in downtown Cedar Rapids.  As a result of
this decision, IPL assessed the recoverability of its steam assets in downtown
Cedar Rapids in 2009 and determined the carrying amount of the assets exceeded
the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the assets.  The
carrying value of the assets was reduced by $4 million in 2009 to equal the
estimated fair value of the assets.  The fair value of the assets was
estimated using the expected cash flows from the assets for the remainder of
their useful life and the anticipated salvage value of the
assets.  Alliant Energy and IPL recognized the $4 million impairment
charge in “Utility other operation and maintenance expenses” in their
Consolidated Statements of Income in 2009.  Refer to Note 1(e) for
further discussion of IPL’s steam plant in service.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

(a)  Accounting
for Derivative Instruments -

Purpose

-

Alliant Energy periodically uses derivative instruments for risk
management purposes to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in interest rates,
certain commodity prices, transmission congestion costs and currency exchange
rates.  Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s current derivative
instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments.  IPL’s
and WPL’s derivative instruments include electric physical forward purchase
contracts and swap contracts to mitigate pricing volatility for the electricity
purchased to supply to their customers, electric physical forward sale contracts
to offset long positions created by reductions in electricity demand forecasts,
natural gas swap contracts to mitigate pricing volatility for the fuel used to
supply to the natural gas-fired electric generating facilities they operate,
natural gas options to mitigate price increases during periods of high demand or
lack of supply, FTRs acquired to manage transmission congestion costs, natural
gas swap contracts to mitigate pricing volatility for natural gas supplied to
their retail customers and embedded foreign currency derivatives related to
Euro-denominated payment terms included in the wind turbine supply contract with
Vestas.  Resources’ derivative instruments include oil contracts,
which are used to mitigate pricing volatility for anticipated purchases of
diesel fuel to fuel standby generators owned by its Non-regulated Generation
business.

Credit
Risk-related Contingent Features

-

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have entered into various agreements that
contain credit risk-related contingent features including requirements for them
to maintain certain credit ratings from each of the major credit rating agencies
and limitations on their liability positions under the various
agreements.  In the event of a downgrade in their credit ratings or if
their liability positions exceed certain contractual limits, Alliant Energy, IPL
or WPL may need to provide credit support in the form of letters of credit or
cash collateral up to the amount of their exposure under the contracts, or may
need to unwind the contracts and pay the underlying liability
positions.

Certain
of these agreements with credit risk-related contingency features are accounted
for as derivative instruments.  The aggregate fair value of all
derivatives with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net
liability position on Dec. 31, 2009 was $119.3 million, $53.0 million and $66.3
million for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL, respectively.  At Dec. 31,
2009, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL all had investment-grade credit
ratings.  However, WPL exceeded its liability position with one
counterparty requiring it to post cash collateral.  If the most
restrictive credit risk-related contingent features for derivative agreements in
a net liability position were triggered on Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy, IPL
and WPL would be required to post an additional $117.8 million, $53.0 million
and $64.8 million, respectively, of credit support to their
counterparties.  Refer to Note 4(d) for additional details of total
cash collateral posted by Alliant Energy and WPL at Dec. 31, 2009 and
2008.


(b)  Weather
Derivatives -

IPL and WPL periodically use non-exchange traded swap
agreements based on cooling degree days (CDD) and heating degree days (HDD)
measured in their utility service territories to reduce the impact of weather
volatility on their electric and natural gas sales volumes.  These
weather derivatives are accounted for using the intrinsic value
method.  Any premiums paid related to these weather derivative
agreements are expensed over each respective contract period.  IPL’s
and WPL’s ratepayers do not pay any of the premiums nor do they share in the
gains or losses realized from these weather derivatives.

Summer
weather derivatives

- -

IPL and WPL periodically utilize weather derivatives based on CDD to
reduce the impact of weather volatility on their electric margins for June 1
through Aug. 31 each year.  Weather derivatives are based on CDD
measured in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Madison, Wisconsin.  The actual CDD
measured during these periods resulted in settlements with the counterparties
under the agreements, which included net receipts of $9.0 million (IPL receiving
$7.0 million and WPL receiving $2.0 million) and net payments of $0.6 million
(IPL receiving $1.4 million and WPL paying $2.0 million) in 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  IPL and WPL did not enter into CDD swap agreements in
2009.

Winter
weather derivatives

- -

IPL and WPL periodically utilize weather derivatives based on HDD to
reduce the impact of weather volatility on IPL’s and WPL’s electric and gas
margins for Jan. 1 through March 31 and Nov. 1 through Dec. 31

each
calendar year.  Weather derivatives are based on HDD measured in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa and Madison, Wisconsin.  The actual HDD measured during
these periods resulted in settlements with the counterparties under the
agreements, which included net payments of $8.8 million (IPL paying $5.4 million
and WPL paying $3.4 million), net payments of $9.0 million (IPL paying $5.4
million and WPL paying $3.6 million) and net payments of $0.8 million (IPL
paying $0.7 million and WPL paying $0.1 million) in the first half of 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, IPL and WPL did not
enter into HDD swap agreements for Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, 2009 and Jan. 1
through March 31, 2010.

The
counterparties to certain of these contracts were required to provide cash
collateral to IPL and WPL.  As of Dec. 31, 2008, the outstanding cash
collateral received by IPL and WPL of $5.4 million and $1.4 million,
respectively, was recorded in “Accounts payable” on the respective Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  All remaining cash collateral related to weather
derivatives was returned to the counterparty in 2009.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

(a)  Capital
Purchase Obligations -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have entered into
capital purchase obligations that contain minimum future commitments related to
certain capital expenditures for their proposed wind projects.  The
obligations are primarily related to capital purchase obligations under a master
supply agreement executed in 2008 with Vestas for the purchase of 500 MW of wind
turbine generator sets and related equipment to support IPL’s and WPL’s wind
generation plans.  A portion of the future payments are denominated in
Euros and therefore are subject to change with fluctuations in currency exchange
rates.  At Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s minimum
future commitments related to these capital expenditures were as follows (in
millions):

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have entered
into various commodity supply, transportation and storage contracts to meet
their obligations to deliver electricity and natural gas to their utility
customers.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL also enter into other
operating expense purchase obligations with various vendors for other goods and
services.  At Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s minimum

transactions.

(b)

IPL and WPL enter
      into coal transportation contracts that are directly assigned to their
      specific generating stations, the amounts of which are included in Alliant
      Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s tables above.  Also included in
      Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s tables are IPL’s respective portion of coal and
      coal transportation contracts related to jointly-owned generating stations
      not operated by IPL.  In addition, Corporate Services entered
      into system-wide coal contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL of $103 million,
      $95 million and $7 million for 2010 to 2012, respectively, to allow
      flexibility for the changing needs of the quantity of coal consumed by
      each.  Coal contract quantities are allocated to specific IPL or
      WPL generating stations at or before the time of delivery based on various
      factors including projected heat input requirements, combustion
      compatibility and efficiency.  These system-wide coal contracts
      have not been directly assigned to IPL and WPL since the specific needs of
      each utility are not yet known and therefore are excluded from IPL’s and
      WPL’s tables.

(c)

IPL has entered into
      forward contracts to purchase SO2 emission allowances with vintage years
      of 2014 through 2017 and NOx emission allowances with vintage years of
      2009 through 2011 from various counterparties for $34 million and $10
      million, respectively.  IPL may utilize any SO2 emission
      allowances acquired under these forward contracts to meet requirements
      under the Acid Rain Program regulations or the more stringent Clean Air
      Interstate Rule (CAIR) emission reduction standards.  IPL
      entered into the forward contracts to purchase NOx emission allowances
      solely for the purpose of compliance with the CAIR emission reduction
      standards.  IPL is currently monitoring the status of the
      forward contracts to purchase SO2 and NOx emission allowances in light of
      various court rulings in 2008 and anticipated EPA proceedings regarding
      changes to CAIR.  Alliant Energy and IPL do not currently
      believe any losses from these forward contracts are probable and therefore
      have not recognized any loss contingency amounts related to the forward
      contracts as of Dec. 31, 2009.  Alliant Energy and IPL are
      currently unable to predict the ultimate impact these forward contracts
      will have on their financial condition or results of
      operations.

(d)

Includes individual
      commitments incurred during the normal course of business that exceeded $1
      million at Dec. 31, 2009.


Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL enter into certain contracts that are considered leases and
are therefore not included here, but are included in Note 3.

(c)  Legal
Proceedings -

Air
Permitting Violation Claims

-

In October 2009, WPL, as an owner and the operator of the Nelson Dewey
Generating Station (Nelson Dewey) and the Columbia Energy Center (Columbia),
received from Sierra Club a notice of intent to file a civil lawsuit (NOI) based
on allegations that modifications were made at those facilities without
complying with the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program
requirements, Title V Operating Permit requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA)
and state regulatory counterparts contained within the Wisconsin State
Implementation Plans (SIP) designed to implement the CAA.  In December
2009, WPL received from the Sierra Club a separate NOI, which contained similar
allegations regarding the Edgewater Generating Station
(Edgewater).  The NOIs allege that various projects performed at
Nelson Dewey, Columbia and Edgewater in years past were major modifications, as
defined in the CAA, and that the owners violated the CAA when they undertook
those projects without obtaining permits and installing the best available
emission controls for SO2, NOx and particulate matter.  In the
Edgewater NOI, additional allegations were made regarding violations of emission
limits for visible emissions.

In
December 2009, the EPA sent a Notice of Violation (NOV) to WPL as an owner and
the operator of Nelson Dewey, Columbia and Edgewater.  The NOV alleges
that the owners failed to comply with appropriate pre-construction review and
permitting requirements and as a result violated the PSD program requirements,
Title V Operating Permit requirements of the CAA and the SIP.

If
pursued successfully by the EPA and/or the Sierra Club, these actions could
result in civil penalties in amounts of up to $37,500 per day for each violation
and/or injunctive relief to require installation of pollution control technology
at Nelson Dewey, Columbia and Edgewater, which would increase future capital and
operating expenditures of Alliant Energy and WPL.  Alliant Energy and
WPL are currently reviewing the allegations and are unable to predict the impact
of the allegations on their financial conditions or results of operations, but
believe that an adverse outcome could be significant.  WPL and the
other owners of Columbia and Edgewater are exploring settlement options with
each of the EPA and Sierra Club while simultaneously defending against these
actions.  WPL believes the projects at Nelson Dewey, Columbia and
Edgewater were routine or not projected to increase emissions therefore did not
violate the permitting requirements of the CAA.  Alliant Energy and
WPL do not currently believe any losses from these allegations are both probable
and reasonably estimable and therefore have not recognized any related loss
contingency amounts as of Dec. 31, 2009.

Shareowner
Derivative Complaint

-

On Feb. 27, 2009, a purported shareowner filed in the Circuit Court for
Dane County, Wisconsin, a derivative complaint against certain current and
former officers and directors of Alliant Energy alleging that such officers and
directors breached their fiduciary duties by approving sales of assets of
Resources in violation of the Indenture with respect to the Exchangeable Senior
Notes due 2030 and wasting Alliant Energy’s assets by compensating such officers
and directors in connection with such sales.  Alliant Energy believes
the derivative complaint is without merit and intends to vigorously defend
against this litigation.  The purported shareowner had previously made
a demand asking the Board of Directors to take action to remedy the alleged
breaches of fiduciary duties by certain officers and directors.  Under
Wisconsin law, if a shareowner commences a derivative proceeding after making
such a demand, the court must dismiss such a derivative proceeding if a
committee of independent directors appointed by independent directors
determines, acting in good faith after conducting a reasonable inquiry upon
which its conclusions are based, that maintenance of the derivative proceeding
is not in the best interests of the corporation.  The independent
directors of Alliant Energy appointed such a special litigation committee of
independent directors, which conducted an inquiry into the allegations made in
the demand from the purported shareowner and in a report delivered to Alliant
Energy determined that maintenance of the derivative proceeding is not in the
best interests of Alliant Energy.  Based on that report, on Sep. 14,
2009, Alliant Energy filed a motion to dismiss the derivative proceeding in the
Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin.  Alliant Energy does not
currently believe any losses from the purported shareowner action are both
probable and reasonably estimable and therefore has not recognized any related
loss contingency amounts as of Dec. 31, 2009.

Alliant
Energy Cash Balance Pension Plan (Plan)

-

In February 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against the
Plan.  The complaint alleges that certain Plan participants who
received distributions prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the
full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 because the Plan applied an improper interest
crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement
age.  These Plan participants are limited to individuals who received
a lump sum distribution and/or received any form of distribution calculated
under the Plan’s prior formula after that benefit was determined to be more
valuable than their benefit calculated under the Plan’s cash balance
formula.  The court has certified two subclasses of plaintiffs that in
aggregate include all persons vested or partially vested in the Plan who
received these distributions of the cash balance formula benefit from Jan. 1,
1998 through Aug. 17, 2006 including: 1) persons who received distributions from
Jan. 1, 1998 through Feb. 28, 2002; and 2) persons who received distributions
from Feb. 29, 2002 through Aug. 17, 2006.  Alliant Energy is
contesting the case and the parties are proceeding with discovery.  In
September 2009, the plaintiffs submitted reports by their expert witnesses that
quantified the alleged underpayments owed to plaintiffs between $24 million and
$54 million, including interest.  Alliant Energy disputes these
amounts.  Trial is scheduled for June 2010.  Alliant Energy
is currently unable to predict the final outcome of the class action lawsuit or
the ultimate impact on its financial condition or results of operations but
believes an adverse outcome could have a material effect on retirement plan
funding and expense for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.


During
2009, the interest crediting rate used to project the cash balance account to
participant’s normal retirement age was also being considered by the IRS as part
of its review of Alliant Energy’s request for a favorable determination letter
with respect to the tax-qualified status of the Plan.  In December
2009, Alliant Energy reached a tentative agreement with the IRS, which is
expected to result in Alliant Energy obtaining a favorable determination letter
for the Plan.  The agreement with the IRS will require an amendment to
the Plan, which is expected to result in future payments to certain Plan
participants.

As of
Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy recognized a loss contingency of $5 million ($2
million at IPL and $2 million at WPL) in aggregate related to the class action
lawsuit and the anticipated Plan amendment resulting from the tentative
agreement reached with the IRS.

Other

- - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are involved in other legal and administrative
proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising
in the ordinary course of business.  Although unable to predict the
outcome of these matters, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe that appropriate
reserves have been established and final disposition of these actions will not
have a material adverse effect on their financial condition or results of
operations.

(d)

Guarantees
and Indemnifications

-

Alliant Energy provided indemnifications associated with various sales of its
non-regulated and utility businesses/assets for losses resulting from potential
breach of the representations and warranties made by Alliant Energy on the sale
dates and for the breach of its obligations under the sale
agreements.  Alliant Energy believes the likelihood of having to make
any material cash payments under these indemnifications is
remote.  Alliant Energy recorded liabilities of $1 million related to
these indemnifications as of Dec. 31, 2009.  The terms of the
indemnifications provided by Alliant Energy at Dec. 31, 2009 for the various
sales were generally as follows (in millions):

Alliant
Energy also continues to guarantee the abandonment obligations of Whiting
Petroleum Corporation under the Point Arguello partnership
agreements.  The guarantee does not include a maximum
limit.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, the present value of the abandonment
obligations is estimated at $23 million.  Alliant Energy believes that
no payments will be made under this guarantee.

Refer to
Note 3(a) for discussion of Alliant Energy’s residual value guarantees of its
synthetic leases.

(e)  Environmental
Matters -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to environmental
regulations as a result of their current and past operations.  These
regulations are designed to protect public health and the environment and have
resulted in compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations
which are recorded as environmental liabilities.  At Dec. 31, current
environmental liabilities were included in “Other current liabilities” and
non-current environmental liabilities were included in “Other long-term
liabilities and deferred credits” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows

MGP
Sites

-

IPL and WPL have current or previous ownership interests in 40 and 14
sites, respectively, previously associated with the production of gas for which
they may be liable for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs relating
to the sites.  IPL and WPL have received letters from state
environmental agencies requiring no further action at ten and eight sites,
respectively.  Additionally, IPL has met state environmental agency
expectations at three additional sites requiring no further action for soil
remediation.  IPL and WPL are working pursuant to the requirements of
various federal and state agencies to investigate, mitigate, prevent and
remediate, where necessary, the environmental impacts to property, including
natural resources, at and around the sites in order to protect public health and
the environment.

IPL and
WPL record environmental liabilities related to these MGP sites based upon
periodic studies.  Such amounts are based on the best current estimate
of the remaining amount to be incurred for investigation, remediation and
monitoring costs for those sites where the investigation process has been or is
substantially completed, and the minimum of the estimated cost range for those
sites where the investigation is in its earlier stages.  There are
inherent uncertainties associated with the estimated remaining costs for MGP
projects primarily due to unknown site conditions and potential changes in
regulatory agency requirements.  It is possible that future cost
estimates will be greater than current estimates as the investigation process
proceeds and as additional facts become known.  The amounts recognized
as liabilities are reduced for expenditures incurred and are adjusted as further
information develops or circumstances change.  Costs of future
expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to
their fair value.  Management currently estimates the range of
remaining costs to be incurred for the investigation, remediation and monitoring
of Alliant Energy’s sites to be $20 million ($15 million for IPL and $5 million
for WPL) to $42 million ($36 million for IPL and $6 million for
WPL).  At Dec. 31, 2009, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL had recorded $35
million, $30 million and $5 million, respectively, in current and non-current
environmental liabilities for their remaining costs to be incurred for these MGP
sites.

Refer to
Note 1(b) for discussion of regulatory assets recorded by IPL and WPL, which
reflect the probable future rate recovery of MGP
expenditures.  Considering the current rate treatment, and assuming no
material change therein, IPL and WPL believe that the clean-up costs incurred
for these MGP sites will not have a material adverse effect on their respective
financial condition or results of operations.  Settlement has been
reached with all of IPL’s and WPL’s insurance carriers regarding reimbursement
for their MGP-related costs and such amounts have been accounted for as directed
by the applicable regulatory jurisdiction.

Other
Environmental Contingencies

-

In addition to the environmental liabilities discussed above, Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL also monitor various environmental regulations that may have
a significant impact on their future operations.  Given uncertainties
regarding the outcome, timing and compliance plans for these environmental
regulations, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently not able to determine the
complete financial impact of these regulations but do believe that future
capital investments and/or modifications to their electric generating facilities
to comply with these regulations could be significant.  Specific
current, proposed or potential environmental regulations that may require
significant future expenditures by Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL include, among
others: CAIR, Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), Utility Maximum Available
Control Technology (MACT) Rule, Wisconsin State Mercury Rule, Wisconsin
Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) Rule, Ozone National Ambient Air
Quality Standard (NAAQS) Rule, Fine Particle NAAQS Rule, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
NAAQS Rule, SO2 NAAQS Rule, Industrial Boiler and Process Heater MACT Rule,
Federal Clean Water Act including Section 316(b), Wisconsin State Thermal Rule,
Coal Combustion By-products (CCB) and various legislation and EPA regulations to
monitor and regulate the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) including the EPA
Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule, GHG Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Finding
and GHG Tailoring Rule.  The following provides a brief description of
these environmental regulations.

Air
Quality -

CAIR

is an emissions trading program that requires SO2 and NOx emissions reductions
at IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating units with greater than 25 MW capacity
through installation of emission controls or purchases of
allowances.  The requirements of this rule remain subject to further
review by the federal courts and the EPA.

CAVR

addresses regional haze at national parks and wilderness areas and is expected
to require reductions in visibility-impairing emissions, including particulate
matter, SO2, and NOx, from certain electric generating units by installing
emission controls including those determined to be Best Available Retrofit
Technology.  The requirements of this rule remain subject to further
review by the federal courts and the EPA.

Utility
MACT Standard

is expected to require standards for the control of mercury
and other federal hazardous air pollutants for coal- and oil-fired electric
utility steam generating units over 25 MW.


Wisconsin
State Mercury Rule

requires WPL’s existing coal-fired electric generating
facilities to reduce annual mercury emissions by 40% from a historic baseline
beginning in 2010, and to either achieve a 90% annual mercury emissions
reduction standard or limit the annual concentration of mercury emissions to
0.008 pounds of mercury per gigawatt-hour beginning in 2015.

Wisconsin
RACT Rule

requires NOx emissions reductions at WPL’s Edgewater generating
facility since it is located in Sheboygan County, which is currently designated
as a non-attainment area for the existing eight-hour ozone
standard.

Ozone
NAAQS Rule

is expected to require NOx emissions reductions from electric
generating units located in areas designated as non-attainment with a more
stringent eight-hour ozone standard adopted in 2008 and is under review by the
EPA to be further strengthened in 2010.  The EPA’s final designations
identifying non-attainment areas for the revised ozone standard are expected to
be issued in 2011.

Fine
Particle NAAQS Rule

may require SO2 and NOx emission reductions in areas
designated as non-attainment.  The EPA lowered the 24-hour standard
and left the annual standard unchanged.  In response to a February
2009 court decision, the EPA is reviewing whether the annual fine particulate
matter (PM2.5) standard should also be lowered.

NO2
NAAQS Rule

requires a new one-hour NO2 standard of 100 parts per billion
(ppb) and associated ambient air monitoring requirements, while maintaining the
current annual standard of 53 ppb.  The EPA’s final designations
identifying non-attainment areas for the revised NO2 standard are expected to be
issued in 2012.

SO2
NAAQS Rule

is expected to establish a new one-hour SO2 standard and
associated monitoring requirements.  The proposed rule would revise
the primary SO2 standard to a one-hour level of between 50 and 100
ppb.  The EPA is under a court order to issue a final SO2 standard by
June 2010.

Industrial
Boiler and Process Heater MACT Rule

may require reductions of emissions
of hazardous air pollutants at smaller electric generating units less than 25
MW, auxiliary boilers and process heaters located at electric generating
facilities.  The requirements of this rule remain subject to further
review by the federal courts, the EPA and state environmental
agencies.

Water
Quality -

Section
316(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act

is expected to require
modifications to cooling water intake structures at seven of IPL’s electric
generating facilities and three of WPL’s electric generating facilities to
assure that these structures reflect the “best technology available” for
minimizing adverse environmental impacts to fish and other aquatic
life.  The requirements of this rule remain subject to further review
by the federal courts and the EPA.

Wisconsin
State Thermal Rule

is expected to require modifications to certain of
WPL’s electric generating facilities to limit the amount of heat those
facilities can discharge into Wisconsin waters.  The requirements of
this state adopted rule remain subject to further review and approval by the
EPA.

Land
and Solid Waste -

CCB

could impose additional requirements for CCB management, beneficial use
applications and disposal.

GHG
Emissions -

Proposed
GHG Emission Legislation and EPA Regulations

- Public awareness of
climate change may result in policymakers taking action to mitigate global
warming.  Several members of Congress have proposed legislation to
regulate GHG emissions, primarily targeting reductions of carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions.  State and regional initiatives to address GHG emissions
are also underway in states covering Alliant Energy’s utility service
territories.  Alliant Energy continues to take voluntary measures to
reduce its GHG emissions, including CO2, as prudent steps to address potential
climate change regulations.

EPA
Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule

requires that sources above certain
threshold levels monitor and report GHG emissions.  The annual
reporting compliance requirement begins for the calendar year 2010 with the
first GHG emissions reports due by March 2011.

GHG
Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Finding

is an EPA rule establishing
that current and projected concentrations of GHG emissions in the atmosphere
threaten the public health and welfare.  The finalization of these
findings is requisite to EPA’s future issuance of regulations to reduce GHG
emissions from motor vehicles or other emissions sources, which could include
electric utility operations.


GHG
Tailoring Rule

is an EPA rule proposal to establish CAA permit
applicability thresholds for construction and operation of facilities emitting
GHG.  The proposal would also require new and significantly modified
facilities to demonstrate use of the Best Available Control Technologies and
energy efficiency measures to minimize GHG emissions.

(f)  Credit
Risk -

Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to credit risk related to
the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or
the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted
commodities, other goods or services at the contracted price.

IPL and
WPL provide regulated electricity and natural gas services to residential,
commercial, industrial and wholesale customers in the Midwest region of the
U.S.  The geographic concentration of their customers did not
contribute significantly to their overall exposure to credit risk.  In
addition, as a result of their diverse customer base, IPL and WPL did not have
any significant concentration of credit risk for receivables arising from the
sale of electricity and natural gas services.

IPL and
WPL are typically net buyers of commodities (primarily electricity, coal and
natural gas) required to provide regulated electricity and natural gas services
to its customers.  As a result, IPL and WPL are also subject to credit
risk related to their counterparties’ failures to deliver commodities at the
contracted price.

Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL maintain credit policies to minimize their credit
risk.  These credit policies include evaluation of the financial
condition of counterparties, use of credit risk-related contingent provisions in
certain commodity agreements that require credit support from counterparties
that exceed certain exposure limits, diversification of counterparties to
minimize concentrations of credit risk and the use of standardized agreements
that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single
counterparty.  Based on these credit policies, it is unlikely that a
material adverse effect on Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s or WPL’s financial condition
or results of operations would occur as a result of counterparty
non-performance.  However, there is no assurance that such policies
will protect Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL against all losses from non-performance
by counterparties.

(g)  Sutherland
#4 Generation Project -

In November 2007, IPL, Central Iowa Power
Cooperative (CIPCO) and Corn Belt Power Cooperative (Corn Belt) entered into a
joint operating agreement for joint ownership of the proposed 630 MW coal fired
electric generating facility in Marshalltown, Iowa referred to as Sutherland
#4.  In January 2008 and January 2009, several members of North Iowa
Municipal Electric Cooperative Association (NIMECA) also entered into the joint
operating agreement for Sutherland #4 with IPL, CIPCO and Corn
Belt.  In March 2009, a decision was made not to proceed with the
construction of Sutherland #4.  The decision was based on a
combination of factors including current economic and financial conditions;
increasing environmental, legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding
future regulation of GHG and other air emissions; and regulatory conditions
placed upon the project.

The joint
operating agreement for Sutherland #4 included a provision that obligated IPL to
reimburse its joint partners (CIPCO, Corn Belt and NIMECA) for payments they
incurred for Sutherland #4 if IPL notified each of the joint partners in writing
that it is abandoning Sutherland #4 due to a decision by the IUB regarding IPL’s
allowed return on equity for Sutherland #4 that is unsatisfactory to IPL in its
sole discretion.  In the third and fourth quarters of 2009, IPL
received correspondence from its joint partners alleging IPL was obligated under
the terms of the joint operating agreement to reimburse the joint partners for
payments they incurred for Sutherland #4, which totaled $14 million in
aggregate.  In the fourth quarter of 2009, IPL entered into a
settlement agreement with its joint partners to resolve this matter, which
resulted in IPL making $4 million of aggregate payments to its joint partners in
the fourth quarter of 2009.  The $4 million of aggregate payments were
recorded in “Utility other operation and maintenance” in Alliant Energy’s and
IPL’s Consolidated Statements of Income in 2009.

(h)  Collective
Bargaining Agreements -

At Dec. 31, 2009, employees covered by collective
bargaining agreements represented 50%, 81% and 93% of total employees of Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL, respectively.  In August 2010, IPL’s collective
bargaining agreement with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW)
Local 204 (Cedar Rapids) expires representing 15% and 52% of total employees of
Alliant Energy and IPL, respectively.  While negotiations to renew the
contract with IBEW Local 204 (Cedar Rapids) are underway, Alliant Energy and IPL
are currently unable to predict the outcome.

(i)  WPL’s
Contingent Purchase Agreement for Edgewater Generating Station Unit 5 (Edgewater
Unit 5) -

In 2009, WPL and Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO)
entered into a contingent agreement for WPL to purchase WEPCO’s 25% ownership
interest in Edgewater Unit 5.  The agreement will become binding if
WEPCO is unable to reach an agreement with a third party to sell their
interest.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions,
including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.  If the
purchase is completed, WPL would own 100% of Edgewater Unit 5.


(13)

JOINTLY-OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANT

Under
joint ownership agreements with other utilities, IPL and WPL have undivided
ownership interests in jointly-owned electric generating
facilities.  Each of the respective owners is responsible for the
financing of its portion of the construction costs.  Kilowatt-hour
generation and operating expenses are primarily divided between the joint owners
on the same basis as ownership.  IPL’s and WPL’s shares of expenses
from jointly-owned electric generating facilities are included in the
corresponding operating expenses (e.g. electric production fuel, other operation
and maintenance, etc.) on their respective Consolidated Statements of
Income.  Refer to Note 1(b) for further discussion of cost of removal
obligations.  Information relative to IPL’s and WPL’s ownership
interest in these jointly-owned electric generating facilities at Dec. 31, 2009
was as follows (dollars in millions):

SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS

Alliant
Energy’s principal businesses as of Dec. 31, 2009 are:

·

Utility
      business -

includes the operations of IPL and WPL, which serve
      customers in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota.  The utility
      business has three segments: a) electric operations; b) gas operations;
      and c) other, which includes steam operations, various other
      energy-related products and services and the unallocated portions of the
      utility business.  Various line items in the following tables
      are not allocated to the electric and gas segments for management
      reporting purposes and therefore are included in “Total Utility
      Business.”  Also included for 2007 are operations of Alliant
      Energy’s utility operations in Illinois and IPL’s electric transmission
      assets sold in 2007.  Refer to Notes 17 and 22 for additional
      information on these sales.

·

Non-regulated
      businesses -

includes the operations of Resources and its
      subsidiaries.  The non-regulated businesses have two segments:
      a) RMT; and b) other, which includes the operations of the Non-regulated
      Generation business, Transportation business and other non-regulated
      investments described in Note 1(a); the operations of Resources (the
      non-regulated parent company); and any Resources consolidating
      adjustments.

·

Other
      -

includes the operations of Alliant Energy (the parent company)
      and Corporate Services, as well as any Alliant Energy parent company
      consolidating adjustments.

(a)

In 2007, Alliant
      Energy received net proceeds of $66 million and recorded a $10.7 million
      pre-tax gain related to the sale of its Mexico business.  The
      increase in the fair value during 2007 that was realized upon sale of the
      Mexico business was largely due to the resolution of uncertainties
      regarding completion of the pending
sale.

(b)

In 2008, Alliant
      Energy reached a settlement with the IRS related to the audit of its U.S.
      federal income tax returns for calendar years 2002 through
      2004.  As a result of completing the audit and recording known
      adjustments for the tax returns for calendar years 2005 and 2007, Alliant
      Energy recorded decreases in its liabilities for uncertain tax positions
      and related interest, net of tax, and changes to its provision for income
      taxes including the impact of $8 million of income tax benefits allocated
      to its discontinued operations in 2008 largely related to its former
      Australia and China businesses.

(c)

In 2007, Alliant
      Energy reached a settlement with the IRS related to the audit of its U.S.
      federal income tax returns for calendar years 1999 through 2001,
      reassessed the most likely outcome of its 2002 through 2005 federal and
      state income tax audits and completed the filing of its U.S. federal
      income tax return for the calendar year 2006.  In addition,
      Alliant Energy reversed deferred tax asset valuation allowances originally
      recorded in prior years related to a change in Alliant Energy’s
      anticipated ability to utilize certain capital losses prior to the
      expiration period.  As a result of these events, Alliant Energy
      recorded changes to its provision for income taxes including the impact of
      $1.3 million of income tax expense allocated to its discontinued
      operations in 2007 related to its former Australia, Energy Services and
      China businesses.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(VIEs)

An entity
is considered a VIE if its equity investors do not have sufficient equity at
risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other parties or its equity investors lack any one of the
following three characteristics: (1) control of the entity through voting
rights; (2) the obligation to absorb expected losses of the entity; or (3) the
right to receive expected benefits of the entity.  The primary
beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the financial statements of the
VIE.

After
making an ongoing exhaustive effort, Alliant Energy and WPL concluded they were
unable to obtain the information necessary from the counterparty (subsidiary of
Calpine Corporation) for the Riverside PPA for Alliant Energy and WPL to
determine whether the counterparty is a VIE and if Alliant Energy is the primary
beneficiary.  This PPA is currently accounted for as an operating
lease.  The counterparty for the Riverside PPA sells a portion of its
generating capacity to WPL and can sell its energy output to
WPL.  Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s maximum exposure to loss from this
PPA is undeterminable due to the inability to obtain the necessary information
to complete such evaluation.  In 2009, 2008 and 2007, Alliant Energy’s
(primarily WPL’s) costs, excluding fuel costs, related to the Riverside PPA were
$63 million, $63 million and $64 million, respectively.

IPL uses
special purpose entities for its sale of accounts receivable
program.  Prior to Jan. 1, 2010, special purpose entities were
excluded from the scope of the accounting pronouncement for VIEs and therefore
did not require consolidation.  Refer to Note 1(r) for discussion of
new accounting standards effective Jan. 1, 2010, which impact the accounting for
special purpose entities.

(20)

RELATED PARTIES

System
Coordination and Operating Agreement

-

IPL and WPL are parties to a system coordination and operating
agreement.  The agreement, which has been approved by FERC, provides a
contractual basis for coordinated planning, construction, operation and
maintenance of the interconnected electric generation systems of IPL and
WPL.  Prior to June 1, 2008, the agreement allowed the interconnected
system to be operated as a single entity with off-system sales and purchases
made to market excess system capability or to meet system capability
deficiencies.  Such sales and purchases were allocated among IPL and
WPL based on procedures included in the agreement.  Under the
agreement prior to June 1, 2008, IPL and WPL were fully reimbursed for any
generation expense incurred to support the sale to an affiliate or to a
non-affiliate.  Any margins on sales to non-affiliates were
distributed to IPL and WPL in proportion to each utility’s share of electric
production at the time of the sale.  The procedures were approved by
FERC and all state regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over these
sales.  Effective June 1, 2008, a change was made to designate IPL and
WPL as two separate entities transacting with MISO.  This change
eliminated the need for internal allocations based on procedures in the
agreement and resulted in separate statements from MISO of sales and purchases
for IPL and WPL.  The sales credited to and purchases billed to IPL
and WPL were as follows (in millions):

SALE OF IPL’S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION ASSETS

In
December 2007, IPL completed the sale of its electric transmission assets
located in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois to ITC, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITC
Holdings Corporation (ITC Holdings), for net proceeds of $772
million.  Such proceeds were subject to post-closing adjustments based
on the value of the net assets transferred as of the closing date and assumption
by ITC of certain liabilities of IPL, which resulted in $4 million of additional
net proceeds in 2008.  IPL used proceeds from the sale to issue a $400
million dividend to Alliant Energy, to retire $150 million of its short-term
debt, to fund investments in short-term securities and for general corporate
purposes.  Pursuant to the sale agreement, ITC acquired IPL’s
transmission assets at 34.5-kilovolts and higher, including transmission lines,
transmission substations, and associated land rights, contracts, permits and
equipment.  IPL sold its electric transmission assets in December 2007
in order to monetize the value of the assets to help fund future capital
expenditures, to capture tax benefits under federal tax policy that allowed
deferral of gains on sales of qualifying electric transmission assets completed
prior to Jan. 1, 2008 and to promote regional transmission expansion that is
expected to improve transmission reliability and access for its customers in
Iowa and Minnesota.

The sale
of IPL’s electric transmission assets resulted in a pre-tax gain of $219
million, which was recorded in “Gain on sale of IPL’s electric transmission
assets” in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s Consolidated Statements of Income in
2007.  The gain reflected the net proceeds from the sale less the net
assets sold and an $89 million regulatory liability established pursuant to an
IUB order.  Refer to Note 1(b) for further discussion of this
regulatory liability.  By closing the sale by the end of 2007 and by
meeting certain other requirements, IPL qualifies for a provision of the tax law
that allows IPL to pay taxes related to the gain on the sale ratably over an
eight-year period.

The
operating results of IPL’s electric transmission assets have not been reported
as discontinued operations due to Alliant Energy’s continuing involvement in the
operations of these assets after the disposal transaction.  Refer to
Note 17 for additional information.

The
transmission rates that ITC Holdings’ subsidiaries charge their utility
customers for transmission service are fully regulated by
FERC.  Subsequent to the closing date, IPL pays the regulated rates to
ITC for transmission services needed to serve its customers.


MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

The
management of Interstate Power and Light Company and subsidiary (IPL) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  IPL’s internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

IPL’s
management assessed the effectiveness of IPL’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009 using the criteria set forth in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment,
IPL’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, IPL’s internal control
over financial reporting was effective.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Shareowners of Interstate Power and Light
Company

Cedar
Rapids, Iowa

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Interstate Power and
Light Company and subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
and the related consolidated statements of income, common equity, comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2009.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed in the Index at Item 15.  These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our
audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no
such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our
opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2009 and
2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)  General
- -

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of IPL and
its consolidated subsidiary, IPL SPE LLC.  IPL is a direct subsidiary
of Alliant Energy and is engaged principally in the generation and distribution
of electric energy, the distribution and transportation of natural gas, the
generation and distribution of steam, and various other energy-related
services.  IPL’s primary service territories are located in Iowa and
southern Minnesota.

(3)

LEASES

(a)  Operating
Leases -

IPL’s operating lease rental expenses for 2009, 2008 and 2007
were $4.3 million, $5.8 million and $5.7 million,
respectively.  Contingent rentals from operating leases that were
excluded from these amounts were $1.2 million, $1.2 million and $1.7 million for
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  At Dec. 31, 2009, IPL’s future
minimum operating lease payments, excluding contingent rentals, were as follows

Uncertain
Tax Positions

- IPL adopted new authoritative guidance related to
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on Jan. 1, 2007.  IPL’s
cumulative effect of the adoption was an increase in its net liability for
uncertain tax positions and a reduction to its Jan. 1, 2007 balance of retained
earnings of $1.7 million.

A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of uncertain tax positions,
excluding interest, for IPL for 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows (in

BENEFIT PLANS

(a)  Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans -

A significant number of IPL’s
employees are covered by non-contributory defined benefit pension
plans.  Benefits of the non-contributory defined benefit pension plans
are based on the plan participant’s years of service, age and
compensation.  IPL also provides certain defined benefit
postretirement health care and life benefits to eligible retirees.  In
general, the health care plans are contributory with participants’ contributions
adjusted regularly and the life insurance plans are
non-contributory.

Assumptions

- - The assumptions at the measurement dates of Dec. 31, 2009, Dec. 31, 2008 and
Sep. 30, 2007 for IPL’s qualified defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefits plans were equal to the assumptions used for Alliant
Energy’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans,
respectively, except for the rate of compensation increase for its qualified
defined benefit pension plans.  IPL’s rates of compensation increase
for its qualified defined benefit pension plans were 3.5% for 2009, 2008 and
2007.


Net
Periodic Benefit Costs

- The components of IPL’s net periodic benefit
costs for its qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement
benefits plans were as follows (in millions):

In the
above table, the qualified defined benefit pension plans costs represent only
those respective costs for bargaining unit employees of IPL covered under the
plans that are sponsored by IPL.  The other postretirement benefits
costs represent costs for all IPL employees.  Alliant Energy Corporate
Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) provides services to IPL, and as a result,
IPL is allocated pension and other postretirement benefits costs associated with
Corporate Services.  The following table includes pension benefits
costs (credits) for IPL’s non-bargaining employees who are participants in other
Alliant Energy plans, and the allocated pension and other postretirement
benefits costs associated with Corporate Services for IPL as follows (in
millions):

Alliant
Energy sponsors several non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover
certain current and former key employees.  In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
pension expense allocated to IPL for these plans was $3.3 million, $3.6 million
and $4.5 million, respectively.  Included for 2007 was the settlement
loss of $1.2 million related to payments made to a retired
executive.

The
assumed medical trend rates are critical assumptions in determining the service
and interest cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to
other postretirement benefits costs.  A 1% change in the medical trend
rates for 2009, holding all other assumptions constant, would have the following

In
addition to the estimated amortizations from “Regulatory assets” in the above
table, $4 million of amortizations are expected in 2010 from “Regulatory assets”
associated with Corporate Services employees participating in Alliant Energy
sponsored plans allocated to IPL.


Benefit
Plan Assets and Obligations

- The benefit plan assets and obligations
associated with IPL’s non-bargaining employees who are participants in other
Alliant Energy plans are reported in Alliant Energy’s Consolidated Financial
Statements and are not reported in the following tables.  A
reconciliation of the funded status of IPL’s qualified defined benefit pension
and other postretirement benefits plans to the amounts recognized on IPL’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets at Dec. 31 was as follows (Not Applicable (N/A); in
millions):

In
addition to the amounts recognized in “Regulatory assets” in the above table,
$91 million and $125 million of “Regulatory assets” were recognized for amounts
associated with Corporate Services employees participating in Alliant Energy
sponsored benefit plans that were allocated to IPL at Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Included
in the following table are IPL’s accumulated benefit obligations, aggregate
amounts applicable to qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement
plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, as well as
qualified defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets as of the Dec. 31 measurement date (in

SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS

IPL is a
utility serving customers in Iowa and Minnesota and includes three segments: a)
electric operations; b) gas operations; and c) other, which includes steam
operations, various other energy-related products and services and the
unallocated portions of the utility business.  Various line items in
the following tables are not allocated to the electric and gas segments for
management reporting purposes and therefore are included in
“Total.”  Intersegment revenues were not material to IPL’s operations
and there was no single customer whose revenues were 10% or more of IPL’s
consolidated revenues.  Certain financial information relating to
IPL’s business segments was as follows (in millions):

SELECTED CONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA

(UNAUDITED)


MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The
management of Wisconsin Power and Light Company and subsidiaries (WPL) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  WPL’s internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

WPL’s
management assessed the effectiveness of WPL’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009 using the criteria set forth in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment,
WPL’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, WPL’s internal control
over financial reporting was effective.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Shareowners of Wisconsin Power and Light
Company

Madison,
Wisconsin

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wisconsin Power and
Light Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
and the related consolidated statements of income, common equity, comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2009.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed in the Index at Item 15.  These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our
audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no
such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our
opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2009 and
2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Financial Statements.”

(1)

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)  General
- -

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of WPL and
its primary consolidated subsidiary, WPL Transco LLC.  WPL is a direct
subsidiary of Alliant Energy and is engaged principally in the generation and
distribution of electric energy, the distribution and transportation of natural
gas, and various other energy-related services.  WPL’s service
territories are located in south and central Wisconsin.

(3)

LEASES

(a)  Operating
Leases -

WPL has entered into various agreements related to property,
plant and equipment rights that are accounted for as operating
leases.  WPL’s most significant operating leases relate to certain
purchased power agreements (PPAs).  These PPAs contain fixed rental
payments related to capacity and contingent rental payments related to the
energy portion (actual megawatt-hours) of the respective
agreements.  Rental expenses associated with WPL’s operating leases
were as follows (in millions):

(a)

The synthetic leases
      relate to the financing of certain utility railcars.  The
      entities that lease these assets to WPL are not required to be
      consolidated and are not included on WPL’s Consolidated Balance
      Sheets.  WPL has guaranteed the residual value of the related
      assets, which total $7 million in the aggregate.  The guarantees
      extend through the maturity of each respective underlying lease with
      remaining terms up to six years.  Residual value guarantee
      amounts have been included in the future minimum operating lease
      payments.

(b)

Capital
Lease -

In 2005, WPL entered into a 20-year agreement with Alliant Energy
Resources, LLC’s (Resources’) Non-regulated Generation business to lease the
Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility (SFEF), with an option for two lease renewal
periods thereafter.  The lease became effective in 2005 when SFEF
began commercial operation.  WPL is responsible for the operation of
SFEF and has exclusive rights to its output.  In 2005, the Public
Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) approved this affiliated lease agreement
with initial monthly payments of approximately $1.3 million.  The
lease payments were based on a 50% debt to capital ratio, a return on equity of
10.9%, a cost of debt based on the cost of senior notes issued by Resources’
Non-regulated Generation business in 2005 and certain costs incurred to
construct the facility.  In accordance with its order approving the
lease agreement, the PSCW will review the capital structure, return on equity
and cost of debt every five years from the date of the order.  The
capital lease asset is amortized using the straight-line method over the 20-year
lease term.  Since the inception of the lease in 2005, WPL’s retail
and wholesale rates have included recovery of the monthly SFEF lease
payments.  In 2009, 2008 and 2007, SFEF lease expenses were $18.5
million, $18.8 million and $19.0 million ($12.3 million, $12.6 million and $12.8
million included in “Interest expense” and $6.2 million, $6.2 million and $6.2
million included in “Depreciation and amortization” in WPL’s Consolidated
Statements of Income), respectively.  At Dec. 31, 2009, WPL’s
estimated future minimum capital lease payments for SFEF were as follows (in
millions):

Uncertain
Tax Positions

- WPL adopted new authoritative guidance related to
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on Jan. 1, 2007.  WPL’s
cumulative effect of the adoption was an increase in its net liability for
uncertain tax positions and a reduction to its Jan. 1, 2007 balance of retained
earnings of $0.8 million.

A

BENEFIT PLANS

(a)  Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans -

A significant number of WPL’s
employees are covered by non-contributory defined benefit pension
plans.  Benefits of the non-contributory defined benefit pension plans
are based on the plan participant’s years of service, age and
compensation.  WPL also provides certain defined benefit
postretirement health care and life benefits to eligible retirees.  In
general, the health care plans are contributory with participants’ contributions
adjusted regularly and the life insurance plans are
non-contributory.


Assumptions

- - The assumptions at the measurement dates of Dec. 31, 2009, Dec. 31, 2008 and
Sep. 30, 2007 for WPL’s qualified defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefits plans were equal to the assumptions used for Alliant
Energy’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans,
respectively, except for the rate of compensation increase for its qualified
defined benefit pension plan.  WPL’s rates of compensation increase
for its qualified defined benefit pension plan were 3.5% for 2009, 2008 and
2007.

Net
Periodic Benefit Costs

- The components of WPL’s net periodic benefit
costs for its qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement
benefits plans were as follows (in millions):

      details of the $0.7 million one-time curtailment loss recognized by WPL in
      2009.

(b)

In 2009, WPL
      recognized special termination benefits costs of $0.9 million related to
      the qualified defined benefit pension plan that is sponsored by WPL as a
      result of the elimination of certain operations positions in
      2009.

In the
above table, the qualified defined benefit pension plan costs represent only
those respective costs for bargaining unit employees of WPL covered under the
plan that is sponsored by WPL.  The other postretirement benefits
costs represent costs for all WPL employees.  Alliant Energy Corporate
Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) provides services to WPL, and as a result,

Alliant
Energy sponsors several non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover
certain current and former key employees.  In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
pension expense allocated to WPL for these plans was $2.1 million, $2.0 million
and $2.7 million, respectively.  Included for 2007 was the settlement
loss of $0.8 million related to payments made to a retired
executive.

The
assumed medical trend rates are critical assumptions in determining the service
and interest cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to
other postretirement benefits costs.  A 1% change in the medical trend
rates for 2009, holding all other assumptions constant, would have the following

2010 Alliant Energy Proxy Statement, which will be filed with the SEC within 120
days after the end of Alliant Energy’s fiscal year.

IPL

IPL’s
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Committee) has adopted a policy that
requires advance approval of all audit, audit-related, tax and other permitted
services performed by the independent registered public accounting
firm.  The policy provides for pre-approval by the Committee of
specifically defined audit and non-audit services after the Committee is
provided with the appropriate level of details regarding the specific services
to be provided.  The policy does not permit delegation of the
Committee’s authority to management.  In the event the need for
specific services arises between Committee meetings, the Committee has delegated
to the Chairperson of the Committee authority to approve permitted services
provided that the Chairperson reports any decisions to the Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.  The principal accounting fees billed to Alliant
Energy by its independent registered public accounting firm, all of which were
approved in advance by the Committee, directly related and allocated to IPL were
as follows (in thousands):

Audit
Fees consisted of the fees billed for the audits of the consolidated financial
statements of IPL and its subsidiary; for reviews of financial statements
included in Form 10-Q filings; and for services normally provided in connection
with statutory and regulatory filings such as financing
transactions.  Audit fees also included IPL’s portion of fees for the
2009 and 2008 audits of Alliant Energy’s effectiveness of internal controls over
financial reporting.  Audit-related fees for 2009 and 2008 consisted
of the fees billed for services rendered related to employee benefits plan
audits and attest services not required by statute or
regulations.  Audit-related fees for 2008 also consisted of the fees
billed for services rendered related to IPL’s electric transmission assets sale
agreement.  Tax fees for 2009 and 2008 consisted of the fees billed
for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax
planning, including all services performed by the tax professional staff of
affiliates of the independent registered public accounting firm, except those
rendered in connection with the audit.  All other fees for 2009 and
2008 consisted of seminars, license fees for accounting research software
products and education programs.  The Committee does not consider the
provision of non-audit services by the independent registered public accounting
firm described above to be incompatible with maintaining independence of the
independent registered public accounting firm.

The
information required by Item 14 is incorporated herein by reference to the
relevant information under the caption “Report of the Audit Committee” in the
