DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Uniprise

Uniprise serves the employee benefit needs of
large organizations by developing cost-effective health care
access and benefit strategies and programs, technology and
service-driven solutions tailored to the specific needs of each
corporate customer. Uniprise offers consumers access to a wide
spectrum of health and well-being products and services.
Together with its affiliates, Uniprise’s core business
provides comprehensive, integrated health benefit services to
multi-location employers with more than 5,000 employees,
specializing in large volume transaction management, large-scale
benefit design, and innovative technology solutions designed to
manage and control medical care costs, facilitate access to
care, and transform complex administrative processes into
simpler, efficient, high quality automated processes. In
addition to or as part of the functions described above,
Uniprise has developed Internet applications for physician
inquiries and transactions, customer-specific data analysis for
employers, and consumer access to personal information and
service applications.

Uniprise is the business through which large
employers can access not only Uniprise services, but also all of
UnitedHealth Group’s network-based medical, insurance and
specialty services, through a wide variety of product
arrangements. As of December 31, 2002, Uniprise served over
300 clients, representing approximately 8.6 million
individuals, including approximately 150 of the Fortune 500
companies.



Health Care Services

Our Health Care Services segment consists of our
UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses.

UnitedHealthcare

UnitedHealthcare coordinates health and
well-being services on behalf of local employers and consumers
nationwide. UnitedHealthcare’s products are primarily
marketed to small and mid-size employers with up to 5,000
employees. As of December 31, 2002, this business served
approximately 7.8 million individuals. With its risk-based
product offerings, UnitedHealthcare assumes the risk of both
medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for
a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate for a
one-year period. UnitedHealthcare also provides administrative
and other management services to customers that self-insure the
medical costs of their employees and their dependents, for which
UnitedHealthcare receives a fee. These customers retain the risk
of financing medical benefits for their employees, and
UnitedHealthcare administers the payment of customer funds to
physicians and other health care providers from customer-funded
bank accounts. Small employer groups are more likely to purchase
risk-based products because they are generally unable or
unwilling to bear a greater potential liability for health care
expenditures. UnitedHealthcare offers its products through
affiliates that are usually licensed as insurance companies or
as health maintenance organizations, depending upon a variety of
factors, including state regulations.

UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access
to care through more than 380,000 physicians and 3,500 hospitals
across the United States. The consolidated purchasing power
represented by the individuals UnitedHealthcare serves makes it
possible for UnitedHealthcare to contract for cost-effective
access to a large number of conveniently located care providers.
Directly or through UnitedHealth Group’s family of
companies, UnitedHealthcare offers:

We believe that UnitedHealthcare’s
innovation distinguishes its product offerings from the
competition. UnitedHealthcare designs consumer-oriented health
benefits and services that value individual choice and control
in accessing health care. UnitedHealthcare has programs that
provide health education; admission counseling before hospital
stays; care advocacy to help avoid delays in patients’
stays in the hospital; support for individuals at risk of
needing intensive treatment; continuous coordination for people
with chronic conditions; and prescription drug management, which
promotes safe use of medications. UnitedHealthcare has designed
its programs to encourage consumers to be engaged and active
participants in managing their own health and well-being.
Further, UnitedHealthcare offers Web sites that provide access
to a variety of information, including a directory of network
physicians and hospitals, reports on thousands of health topics
and a health profile tailored to individual interests.



Ovations

Ovations provides health and well-being services
for Americans age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs
for preventative and acute health care services, for services
dealing with chronic disease and for responding to specialized
issues relating to their overall well-being. Ovations is one of
few enterprises fully dedicated to this market segment,
providing products and services in all 50 states, the District
of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
through licensed affiliates.

In January 1998, Ovations initiated a 10-year
contract with AARP, the nation’s largest organization for
older Americans. Ovations offers a range of products and
services to AARP members, and has expanded the scope of services
and programs offered over the past several years.

Ovations operates the nation’s largest
Medicare supplement business, providing Medicare supplement and
hospital indemnity insurance to more than 3.6 million AARP
members. Ovations’ services also include AARP Eye Health
Services, which offers affordable eye exams, complimentary
glaucoma screenings and discounts on eyewear to AARP members and
an expanded AARP Nurse Health Line Service to cover
beneficiaries of all AARP Medicare products, providing 24-hour
access to health information from nurses. Ovations developed an
offering with lower cost Medicare supplement coverage that
provides consumers with a hospital network and 24-hour access to
health care information from nurses. Ovations’ revenues
from the AARP insurance offerings were approximately
$3.7 billion in 2002.

Ovations addresses one of the most significant
cost problems facing older Americans — prescription
drug costs. Ovations offers the nation’s largest pharmacy
discount program, with approximately 1.6 million users, a
mail order discount drug program, and a complimentary health and
well-being catalog offering. These services offer cost savings
and greater access to prescription drugs and health and
well-being products for older Americans.

Through its Evercare® division, Ovations is
one of the nation’s leaders in offering complete,
individualized care planning and care benefits for aging,
vulnerable and chronically ill individuals, serving
approximately 61,000 persons across the nation in nursing homes,
community-based settings and private homes. Evercare offers a
continuum of services through innovative programs such as
EverCare Choice, EverCare Select and EverCare Connections.
EverCare Choice is a Medicare product that offers enhanced
medical coverage to frail, elderly and chronically ill
populations in both nursing homes and community settings. These
services are provided primarily through nurse practitioners,
physicians’ assistants and physicians. EverCare Select is a
Medicaid, long-term health care product for elderly, physically
disabled and other needy individuals. EverCare Connections is a
comprehensive eldercare service program providing service
coordination, consultation, claim management and information and
resource linkages nationwide.

Effective January 1, 2003, Ovations’
Senior and Retiree Services division began providing health care
coverage for the senior market primarily through the
Medicare+Choice program administered by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS) (prior to January 1, 2003,
these services were offered through UnitedHealthcare). Through
these programs, 225,000 Medicare beneficiaries were served as of
December 31, 2002. The Medicare+Choice offerings in 2002
included additional benefits such as more extensive preventative
services and access to specialized support services.
Ovations’ Senior & Retiree Services recently launched
new preferred provider organization (“PPO”) pilot
projects in eight states through an arrangement with CMS.

AmeriChoice

In September 2002, we acquired AmeriChoice
Corporation, a leading health care organization engaged in
facilitating health care benefits and services for state
Medicaid programs and their beneficiaries. We combined
AmeriChoice with our other Medicaid services businesses into a
dedicated business unit of our Health Care Services segment
working exclusively with selected states to address the needs of
their medically vulnerable populations under their Medicaid
programs. We expect that combining AmeriChoice with our existing
Medicaid business will allow us to create efficiencies from the
consolidation of health care provider networks, technology
platforms and operations. As of December 31, 2002, these
businesses



organized health care resources and benefits for
more than one million beneficiaries of Medicaid and other
government-sponsored health care programs in 10 states
through licensed affiliates.

Specialized Care Services

Specialized Care Services is a portfolio of
specialized health and well-being companies, each serving a
specific market need with a unique blend of benefits, provider
networks, services and resources. Specialized Care Services
provides comprehensive products and services that are focused on
highly specialized health care needs, such as mental health and
chemical dependency, employee assistance, organ transplants,
vision and dental services, chiropractic services,
health-related information and other health and well-being
services. These offerings are sold directly to employers and
consumers and indirectly through other UnitedHealth Group
businesses, as well as through unrelated entities. Specialized
Care Services’ products and services include both
risk-based products, in which Specialized Care Services assumes
financial responsibility for health care costs, and products for
which Specialized Care Services receives management and
administrative fees.

Through United Behavioral Health
(“UBH”) and its affiliated companies, Specialized Care
Services provides behavioral health care benefit services,
employee assistance programs and psychiatric disability benefit
services. UBH’s care management capabilities and extensive
network of contracted mental health professionals represent the
core of its product offerings. UBH’s services and products
reach approximately 22 million individuals.

Optum® provides health information
assistance, support and related services designed to improve the
health and well-being of the approximately 23 million
individuals it serves. Through multiple access points, including
the Internet, telephone, audio tapes, print and in-person
consultations, Optum helps consumers address daily living
concerns, make informed health care decisions and become more
effective health care consumers.

Dental Benefit Providers (“DBP”) and
its affiliates provide dental benefit management and related
services. Through an extensive relationship with contracted
dental providers, DBP manages dental benefit offerings for
approximately three million individuals. DBP’s products are
distributed primarily through unaffiliated insurers to
commercial, Medicare and Medicaid populations. DBP also offers
its products and services, both network-based and indemnity
dental care plan designs, to and through UnitedHealth Group
affiliates.

United Resource Networks (“URN”) is the
gateway to highly specialized critical care programs at more
than 70 of the most widely recognized medical centers in the
United States. URN negotiates fixed, competitive rates for
high-cost, complex health care services. Access to URN’s
programs and services is available to approximately
41 million individuals through over 2,200 payers.

National Benefit Resources (“NBR”) is a
managing general underwriter that originates and administers
medical stop loss insurance provided to employers with
self-funded employee benefit plans. NBR markets stop loss
coverage primarily through third party administrators
(“TPAs”) located throughout the United States. NBR
distributes to its customer base certain products and services
of other Specialized Care Services’ businesses, including
those of URN and Optum.

Spectera represents Specialized Care
Services’ operating platform for the vision care market.
Spectera and its licensed subsidiaries specialize in building
vision care benefit partnerships with physicians, optometrists,
employer groups and benefit consultants. Spectera administers
vision benefits for more than seven million individuals through
more than 1,900 employer groups. Spectera provides comprehensive
vision care services through its national network of more than
12,000 private doctors’ offices and retail store locations.

ACN Group provides benefit administration,
network management, and access to chiropractic, physical therapy
and other complementary and alternative health care services
through its network of contracted providers to approximately
18 million consumers.



Specialized Care Services also manages units that
market the sale of group life and accident insurance to small
and medium-sized employer groups.

Ingenix

Ingenix is a leader in the field of health care
data and information, research, analysis and application.
Ingenix serves multiple health care markets on a
business-to-business basis, including pharmaceutical companies,
health insurers and other payers, physicians and other health
care providers, large employers and government agencies. Ingenix
maintains two primary operating divisions: Ingenix Health
Intelligence and Ingenix Pharmaceutical Services.

Ingenix Health Intelligence offers database and
data management services, software products, publications and
consulting services. Ingenix Health Intelligence provides a wide
variety of data and software services and products, including
databases for benchmarking and reimbursement methodology
development, software to analyze and report costs and
utilization of services, data management services, HEDIS
reporting, fraud and abuse detection and prevention services,
claims editing software and reimbursement systems audits. The
consulting services business focuses on actuarial and financial
disciplines, product development, provider contracting and
medical policy and management. Ingenix Health Intelligence also
publishes print and electronic media products that provide
information regarding coding, reimbursement, billing, compliance
and other general health care issues. As of December 31,
2002, Ingenix Health Intelligence provided expanded physician
credentialing services for 100 health plans covering more than
250,000 physicians and other health care providers. In
2002, Ingenix Health Intelligence also expanded its services to
include physician directory databases that enable consumers and
commercial users to perform 100 million web-based searches
per year. As of December 31, 2002, Ingenix Health
Intelligence served more than 3,000 hospitals,
250,000 physicians, 2,000 payers and intermediaries,
and 100 life science customers. Ingenix Health Intelligence
provides medical benefits analyses, quality and utilization data
and predictive modeling products to UnitedHealthcare, Ovations,
Uniprise and their customers.

biotechnology and medical device manufacturers on a global
basis. Ingenix Pharmaceutical Services provides global clinical
research services, including strategic planning, research
protocol development, investigator identification and training,

product questions through economic and outcomes research, safety
and research and patient registries. Ingenix Pharmaceutical
Services also provides medical education and communications
through scientific publications, medical symposia and
interactive web-based technologies.

EXPANSION AND DIVESTITURE OF
OPERATIONS

We continually evaluate expansion opportunities
and, in the normal course of business, often consider whether to
sell certain businesses or stop offering certain products or
services. Expansion opportunities may include acquiring
businesses that are complementary to our existing operations.
During 2002, we completed several acquisitions and ceased
offering some products in certain markets, all as part of our
ongoing emphasis on our strategic focus. Further, we devote
significant attention to internally developing new products and
services for the health and well-being sector as we have broadly
defined it.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Most of our health and well-being services are
regulated. This regulation can vary significantly from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Federal and state regulatory
agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and
interpret and enforce laws and rules. Changes in applicable laws
and regulations are continually being considered, and the
interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change
periodically.



These revisions could affect our consolidated
operations and financial results. Enactment of federal and state
health benefit laws and regulations can also affect our
businesses.

Federal Regulation

Our Health Care Services segment, which includes
UnitedHealthcare, Ovations, and AmeriChoice, has Medicare+Choice
contracts that are regulated by CMS. CMS has the right to audit
our performance in order to determine compliance with CMS’
contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to
members. Our Health Care Services segment also has Medicaid and
State Children’s Health Insurance Program contracts that
are subject to federal and state regulation regarding services
to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those
services, and other aspects of these programs. We believe we are
in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
regulations; however, the significant level of regulations
surrounding Medicare and Medicaid makes compliance in this
product line a continuing challenge.

State Regulation

All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer
insurance and health maintenance products regulate those
products and operations. Most states require periodic financial
reports from us and impose minimum capital or restricted cash
reserve requirements. Many of our health plans and each of our
insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance
holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require
registration with applicable state Departments of Insurance and
the filing of reports that describe capital structure,
ownership, financial condition, certain inter-company
transactions and general business operations. Some state
insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior
regulatory approval of acquisitions and material inter-company
transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the
regulated companies and their parent holding companies or
affiliates. In addition, some of our subsidiaries or products
may be subject to PPO, managed care organization
(“MCO”) or TPA-related regulations and licensure
requirements. These regulations differ greatly from state to
state, but generally contain network, contracting, financial and
reporting requirements. Many states also have enacted laws
and/or adopted regulations governing utilization review and
external appeals activities, and these laws may apply to some of
our operations. Additionally, there are laws and regulations
that set specific standards for delivery of services, prompt
payment of claims, confidentiality of consumer health
information and covered benefits and services. To date, these
various laws and regulations have not materially affected our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

HIPAA

The administrative simplification provisions of
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
as amended (“HIPAA”), apply to both the group and
individual health insurance markets, including self-funded
employee benefit plans. Federal regulations promulgated pursuant
to HIPAA are now effective, with compliance required by April
2003. These regulations include minimum standards for electronic
transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of
protected health information. We are currently in compliance
with these regulations. New standards for national provider and
employer identifiers are currently being developed by
regulators. We intend to be in compliance by the enforcement
dates; however, the law is far-reaching and complex and the
government’s delay in providing guidance on some aspects of
the law may affect the timeliness of our compliance efforts.
Additionally, different approaches to HIPAA’s provisions
and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may
adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and
services across state lines.

ERISA

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (“ERISA”), regulates how goods and
services are provided to or through certain types of
employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a complex set
of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic
interpretation by the United States Department of Labor as well
as the federal courts. ERISA places controls on how our business



units may do business with employers who sponsor
employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain
self-funded plans. During 2002, we processed and administered
the payment of approximately $21 billion of medical claims
on behalf of customers that self-insure the medical costs of
their employees and their employees’ dependents. New ERISA
claim regulations which became effective July 2002 require
ongoing modifications to our operations. We believe that we are
in compliance with the new regulations.

Fraud and Abuse

The regulations and contractual requirements
applicable to participants in federal government health care
programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are complex and changing.
We continue to emphasize our regulatory compliance efforts for
these programs, but ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the
highly technical nature of the regulations mean that compliance
efforts in this arena will continue to require significant
resources. Additionally, states have begun to focus their
anti-fraud efforts on insurance companies and health maintenance
organizations. Some states now require filing and approval of
anti-fraud plans and may monitor compliance as part of any
market conduct examination.

Audits and Investigations

We are regularly subject to governmental audits,
investigations and enforcement actions. Any such government
actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal
fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of
licensure or exclusion from participation in government
programs. In addition, a state Department of Insurance or other
state or federal authority (including CMS, the Office of the
Inspector General and state attorneys general) may from time to
time begin a special audit of one of our health plans, our
insurance plans and products or one of our other operations to
investigate issues such as utilization management; financial,
eligibility or other data reporting; prompt claims payment; or
coverage of medically necessary care, including emergency room
care. We are currently involved in various governmental
investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine,
regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS,
state insurance departments and state attorneys general, the
Office of Personnel Management, the Office of the Inspector
General and U.S. Attorneys. We do not believe the results of any
of the current investigations, audits or reviews, individually
or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

International Regulation

Our Ingenix and Health Care Services segments
both have limited international operations. These international
operations are subject to different legal and regulatory
requirements in local jurisdictions, including various tax,
tariff and trade regulations, as well as employment,
intellectual property and investment rules and laws.

MARKETING

Our marketing strategy is defined and coordinated
by each business’s dedicated marketing staff. Within these
businesses, primary marketing responsibility generally resides
with a marketing leader and a direct sales force. In addition,
several of the segments also rely upon independent insurance
agents and brokers to sell some of their products. Marketing
efforts also include public relations efforts and advertising
programs that may use television, radio, newspapers, magazines,
billboards, direct mail and telemarketing.

COMPETITION

As a diversified health and well-being services
company we operate in highly competitive markets. Our
competitors include managed health care companies, insurance
companies, TPAs and business services outsourcing companies,
health care providers that have formed networks to directly
contract with employers, specialty benefit providers, government
entities, and various information and consulting



companies. New entrants into the markets in which
we compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also
contribute to this competitive environment. We believe the
principal competitive factors affecting us and the sales and
pricing of our products and services include product innovation,
consumer satisfaction, the level and quality of products and
services, network capabilities, price, market share, product
distribution systems, efficient administration operations,
financial strength and marketplace reputation.

We believe that our competitive strengths are
enhanced by our customer focus resulting from our operational
alignment. Each UnitedHealth Group business represents a
strategic platform from which we can penetrate more deeply into
specific markets using our three core competencies: network
management, knowledge and information and service
infrastructure. Other strengths include the breadth and quality
of our products, our geographic scope and diversity, the scope
and depth of our data and information about health care costs
and consumption, our effective use of proprietary tools and
products to coordinate and facilitate programs designed to
realize appropriately lower health care costs, our disciplined
underwriting and pricing practices and staff, our significant
market position in certain geographic areas, the strength of our
distribution network, our financial strength, our generally
large provider networks that provide more consumer choice and
minimize barriers to access, our point-of-service products and
our strong marketplace reputation. However, in some markets we
may be at a disadvantage for a number of reasons, including
competitors with more resources, longer operating histories,
larger market shares, broader networks, narrower networks (which
may allow greater cost control and lower prices) or more
established names and reputations. These competitive factors
could adversely affect our business and operating results.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2002, we employed
approximately 32,000 individuals. We believe our employee
relations are good.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

The statements contained in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, and in the Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
other sections of our Annual Report to Shareholders incorporated
by reference in this Form 10-K, include forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”). When used
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by
us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press
releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and
in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our
executive officers, the words or phrases “believes,”
“anticipates,” “intends,” “will likely
result,” “estimates,” “projects” or
similar expressions are intended to identify such
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual
results to differ materially from the results discussed in the
forward-looking statements.

The following discussion contains certain
cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and
others should consider. This discussion is intended to take
advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the
PSLRA. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal
securities laws, in making these cautionary statements, we do
not undertake to address or update each factor in future filings
or communications regarding our business or operating results,
and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may
have caused results to differ from discussions or information
contained in previous filings or communications. In addition,
any of the matters discussed below may have affected our past,
as well as current, forward-looking statements about future
results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this
Form 10-K, in the 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders, and
in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong.
They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or
by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors
discussed below will be important in determining future results.
Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.
Actual future results may vary materially from expectations
expressed in our prior communications.



Health Care Costs

We use a large portion of our premium revenues to
pay the costs of health care services delivered to our
customers. Accordingly, the profitability of our risk-based
products depends in large part on our ability to accurately
predict, price for, and effectively manage health care costs.
Total health care costs are affected by the number of individual
services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium
revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12-month period and is
generally priced three months before contract commencement.
Services are delivered and related costs are incurred when the
contract commences. Although we base the premiums we charge on
our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium
period, inflation, regulations and other factors may cause
actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and
reflected in premiums. These factors may include increased use
of services, increased cost of individual services,
catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly
treatments, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes,
insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the
level of health care use. Relatively small differences between
predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium
revenues can result in significant changes in our financial
results because of the relatively narrow operating margins of
our risk-based arrangements. In addition, the financial results
we report for any particular period include estimates of costs
incurred for which the underlying claims have not been received
by us or for which the claims have been received but not
processed. If these estimates prove too high or too low, our
earnings may be adjusted later based on actual costs.

Industry Factors

The health and well-being industries receive
significant negative publicity and have been the subject of
large jury verdicts. This publicity has been accompanied by
litigation, legislative activity, regulation and governmental
review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect
our ability to market our products or services, may require us
to change our products and services, and may increase the
regulatory burdens under which we operate, further increasing
our costs of doing business and adversely affecting our
profitability.

Competition

In many of our geographic or product markets, we
compete with a number of other entities, some of which may have
certain characteristics or capabilities that give them a
competitive advantage. We believe the barriers to entry in
certain markets are not substantial, so the addition of new
competitors can occur relatively easily, and consumers enjoy
significant flexibility in moving to competitors. Some of our
customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or
services we provide, which would decrease our revenues. Some of
our contracted physicians and other health care providers may
decide to market products and services to our customers in
competition with us. In addition, significant merger and
acquisition activity has occurred in the industry in which we
operate as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us,
such as the hospital, physician, pharmaceutical, medical device
and health information systems industries. To the extent that
there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in
any market, our ability to retain or increase customers or
contracted physicians and other health care providers, or
maintain or increase our revenue growth, pricing flexibility,
control over medical cost trends and marketing expenses may be
adversely affected.

AARP Contract

Under our long-term contract with AARP, we
provide Medicare Supplement and Hospital Indemnity health
insurance and other products to AARP members. As of
December 31, 2002, our portion of AARP’s insurance
program represented approximately $3.7 billion in annual
net premium revenue from approximately 3.6 million AARP
members. The success of our AARP arrangement depends, in part,
on our ability to service these customers, develop additional
products and services, price the products and services
competitively, and respond effectively to federal and state
regulatory changes. Additionally, events



that adversely affect AARP or one of its other
business partners for its member insurance program could have an
adverse effect on the success of our arrangement with AARP.

Government Programs

In response to medical cost increases that
exceeded Medicare program reimbursement rate growth, we have
withdrawn our Medicare+Choice product offerings from a number of
counties and filed significant benefit adjustments in other
counties. These and other actions have reduced Medicare+Choice
enrollment and may result in further or complete withdrawal of
Medicare+Choice product offerings, when and as permitted by our
contracts with the CMS. Under current regulations, we are
precluded from re-entering the counties from which we have
withdrawn our Medicare+Choice product offerings until two years
after the effective date of withdrawal.

The financial results of our Medicare+Choice,
Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Program
(SCHIP) operations depend on a number of factors, including
program reimbursement increases, government regulations, benefit
design, physician and other health care provider contracting,
state budgetary pressures (Medicaid and SCHIP) and other
factors. There can be no assurance that any or all of our
government program operations will be profitable in future
periods.

Government Regulation

Our business is regulated at the federal, state,
local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our
business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject
to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies
administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and
rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict
revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and
administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our
liability in federal and state courts for coverage
determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We
must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of
our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products
and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions. Delays in
obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals
could reduce our revenue or increase our costs.

We participate in federal, state and local
government health care coverage programs. These programs
generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that
may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce
the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our
administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such
changes have adversely affected our financial results and
willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may
do so in the future.

State legislatures and Congress continue to focus
on health care issues. Bills and regulations at state and
federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business,
including contracting with physicians, hospitals and other
health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods and
payment rates; coverage determinations; claim payments and
processing; use and maintenance of individually identifiable
health information; medical malpractice litigation reform; and
government-sponsored programs. We cannot predict if any of these
initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation,
or, if enacted, what their terms will be, but their enactment
could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability,
require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or
put us at risk for a loss of business to new health care funding
arrangements.

We are also subject to various governmental
investigations, audits and reviews. Such oversight could result
in our loss of licensure or our right to participate in certain
programs, or the imposition of civil or criminal fines,
penalties and other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any
adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage
our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for
us to sell our products and services. We are currently involved
in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews.
These include routine, regular and special investigations,
audits and reviews by the CMS, state and health insurance
departments and state attorneys general, the Office of Personnel
Management, the Office of the Inspector General and U.S.
Attorneys. Although the results of pending matters are always
uncertain, we do not believe the results of any of the current
investigations, audits or reviews, individually



or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Our operations are conducted through our
subsidiaries. These companies are subject to state regulations
that, among other things, may require the maintenance of minimum
levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and may
restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other
distributions that may be paid to their respective parent
companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that
may be paid by our regulated subsidiaries, without prior
approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on
the subsidiary’s level of statutory net income, statutory
capital and surplus. We use cash generated from operations,
commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and
financial flexibility. The agencies that assess our
creditworthiness also consider statutory capital levels when
establishing our debt ratings. We maintain an aggregate
statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is
significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require.

Physician, Hospital and Other Health Care
Provider Relations

One of the significant techniques we use to
contain health care costs and facilitate care delivery is to
contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit
managers and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care
providers for favorable prices. A number of organizations are
advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these
physicians and health care professionals from federal and state
antitrust laws. In any particular market, these physicians and
health care professionals could refuse to contract, demand
higher payments, or take other actions that could result in
higher health care costs, less desirable products for customers
or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements.
In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly
hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty
physician groups, may have significant market positions or near
monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on
our part.

Litigation and Insurance

Sometimes we become a party to the types of legal
actions that can affect any business, such as employment and
employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit
claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder
suits, and intellectual property-related litigation. In
addition, because of the nature of our businesses, we are
routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to
the design, management and offerings of our services. These
matters include, but are not limited to, claims related to
health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions,
contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain
business practices. In 1999, a number of class action lawsuits
were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the
health benefits business. The suits are purported class actions
on behalf of certain customers and physicians for alleged
breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and the Racketeer
Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (“RICO”). We will
incur expenses in the defense of these matters, even if they are
without merit.

Recent court decisions and legislative activity
may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In
some cases, substantial non-economic, treble or punitive damages
may be sought. We currently have insurance coverage for some of
these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not
be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage, or the
amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages
awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive
damages, may not be covered by insurance. The cost of general
business insurance coverage has increased significantly
following the events of September 11, 2001. As a result, we
have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure,
particularly with respect to routine matters incidental to our
business. We record liabilities for our estimates of the
probable costs resulting from self-insured matters. Although we
believe the liabilities established for these risks are
adequate, there can be no assurance that the level of actual
losses will not exceed the liabilities recorded.



Data Integrity and Information
Systems

Our businesses depend significantly on effective
information systems and the integrity of the data we use to run
these businesses. Our ability to adequately price our products
and services, provide effective and efficient service to our
customers, and to accurately report our financial results
depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our
information systems. As a result of our acquisition activities,
we have acquired additional systems. We have been taking steps
to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and
expanded our information systems capabilities. If the
information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be
inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively
our information systems and data integrity, we could lose
existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers,
have problems in determining medical cost estimates and
establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician
and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory
problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other
adverse consequences. Our information systems require an ongoing
commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance
existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with
continuing changes in information processing technology,
evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing
customer preferences. For example, the administrative
simplification provisions of HIPAA and the Department of
Labor’s ERISA claim processing regulations require changes
to our current systems.

We depend on independent third parties for
significant portions of our systems-related support, equipment,
facilities, and certain data, including data center operations,
data network, voice communication services and pharmacy data
processing. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to
such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the
contract, due to internal or external factors. Although there
are a limited number of service organizations with the size,
scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these
services, especially with regard to pharmacy benefits processing
and management, we believe that other organizations could
provide similar services on comparable terms. A change in
service providers, however, could result in a decline in service
quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which
could adversely affect our operating results.

Proprietary Information and Privacy
Regulations

The use of individually identifiable data by our
businesses is regulated at international, federal, state and
local levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by
legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws
address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable
health data. Most are derived from the privacy provisions in the
federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and HIPAA. HIPAA also imposes
guidelines on our business associates (as this term is defined
in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for
appropriate protections through our contracts with our business
associates, we still have limited control over their actions and
practices. Compliance with these proposals and new regulations
may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes,
the development of new administrative processes, and the effects
of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also
may impose further restrictions on our use of patient
identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our
administrative databases.

The success of our knowledge and
information-related businesses also depends significantly on our
ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and
related products. We rely on our agreements with customers,
confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade
secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary
rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent
misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition,
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights
exists in the software industry, and we expect software products
to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as
the number of products and competitors in this industry segment
grows. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on the
ability of our businesses to market and sell products and
services and on our consolidated results of operations.



Administration and Management

Efficient and cost-effective administration of
our operations is essential to our profitability and competitive
positioning. Staff-related and other operating expenses may
increase from time to time due to business or product start-ups
or expansions, growth or changes in business or the mix of
products purchased by customers, acquisitions, regulatory
requirements or other reasons. Unanticipated expense increases
may adversely affect our financial results. We believe we
currently have an experienced, capable management and technical
staff. The market for management and technical personnel,
including information systems professionals, in the health care
industry is very competitive. Loss of key employees or a number
of managers or technical staff could adversely affect our
ability to administer and manage our business.

Marketing

We market our products and services through both
employed sales people and independent sales agents. The
departure of key sales employees or agents or a large subset of
these individuals could impair our ability to retain existing
customers. Some of our customers or potential customers consider
our debt ratings, accreditation or certification by various
private or governmental bodies or rating agencies necessary or
important. Some of our health plans or other business units may
not have obtained or maintained, or may not desire or be able to
obtain or maintain, such ratings, accreditation or
certification, which could adversely affect our ability to
obtain or acquire or retain business from these customers and
potential customers.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

We have an active ongoing acquisition and
disposition program under which we may engage in transactions
involving the acquisition or disposition of assets, products or
businesses, some or all of which may be material. These
transactions may entail risks and uncertainties and may affect
ongoing business operations because of unknown liabilities,
unforeseen administrative needs or the use of resources to
integrate the acquired operations. Failure to identify
liabilities, anticipate additional administrative needs or
effectively integrate acquired operations could result in
reduced revenues, increased administrative and other costs and
customer dissatisfaction.

Terrorist Attacks

The terrorist attacks launched on
September 11, 2001, the war on terrorism, the threat of
future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers
and providers have negatively affected, and may continue to
negatively affect, the U.S. economy in general and our industry
specifically. Depending on the government’s actions and the
responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance
companies, future acts of terrorism and bio-terrorism could
adversely affect us through, among other things, increased use
of health care services including, without limitation, hospital
and physician services; loss of membership in health plans we
administer as a result of lay-offs or other reductions of
employment; adverse effects upon the financial condition or
business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their
employees; disruption of our information and payment systems;
increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability
to carve out certain categories of risk, such as acts of
terrorism; and disruption of the financial and insurance markets
in general.

Financial Outlook

From time to time in press releases and
otherwise, we may publish forecasts or other forward-looking
statements regarding our future results, including estimated
revenues, earnings per share and other operating and financial
metrics. Any forecast of our future performance reflects various
assumptions. These assumptions are subject to significant
uncertainties, and any number of them may prove to be incorrect.
Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous
factors (including those described in this discussion), many of
which are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure that
our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts
or that the variation from such forecasts will not be



material and adverse. You are cautioned not to
base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon
isolated predictions, but instead are encouraged to utilize the
entire publicly available mix of historical and forward-looking
information, as well as other available information affecting us
and our services, when evaluating our prospective consolidated
results of operations.

General Economic Conditions

Changes in economic conditions could affect our
business and results of operations. The state of the economy
affects our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to
increase prices in some of our businesses. Although we are
continuously striving to diversify our product offerings to
address the changing needs of consumers, there can be no
assurance that the effects of the current or a future downturn
in economic conditions will not cause our existing customers to
seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or will
not result in significant loss of customers, or decreased
margins on our continuing customers.

Stock Market

The market prices of the securities of the
publicly-held companies in the industry in which we operate have
shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors,
including general market trends, public communications regarding
managed care, litigation and judicial decisions, legislative or
regulatory actions, health care cost trends, pricing trends,
competition, earnings, membership reports of particular industry
participants and acquisition activity. We cannot assure the
level or stability of the price of our securities at any time or
the effect of the foregoing or any other factors on such prices.

Item 2.

Properties

As of December 31, 2002, we leased
approximately 6.4 million and owned approximately 500,000
aggregate square feet of space in the United States and Europe.
Our leases expire at various dates through May 31, 2025.
Our various segments use this space exclusively for their
respective business purposes and we believe these current
facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are
adequate for our anticipated future needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In September 1999, a group of plaintiffs’
trial lawyers publicly announced that they were targeting the
managed care industry by way of class action litigation. Since
that time, several claims against us have been alleged that
generally challenge managed care practices, including cost
containment mechanisms, disclosure obligations and payment
methodologies. These claims are described in the following
paragraph. We intend to defend vigorously all of these claims.

In Re: Managed Care Litigation: MDL
No. 1334.

A multi-district
litigation panel has consolidated several litigation cases
involving UnitedHealth Group and our affiliates in the Southern
District Court of Florida, Miami division. The first of these
suits was initiated in February 2000. In December 2000, the
UnitedHealth Group litigation was consolidated with litigation
involving other industry members for the coordination of
pre-trial proceedings. The litigation has been divided into two
tracks, with one track comprising consumer claims and the other
health care provider claims. Generally, the claims made in this
consolidated litigation allege violations of ERISA and RICO in
connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to
maximize profits. The litigation also asserts breach of state
prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims alleging that
UnitedHealth Group affiliates fail to timely reimburse providers
for medical services rendered. The consolidated suits seek
injunctive, compensatory and equitable relief as well as
restitution, costs, fees and interest payments. Following the
Court’s initial decisions on industry members’ motions
to dismiss the complaints, amended complaints were filed in both
tracks. On February 20, 2002, the Court granted in part and
denied in part the industry defendants’ motion to dismiss
the amended complaint in the consumer track litigation. In
significant part, the Court limited the RICO and ERISA claims
that could be brought by the plaintiffs, and dismissed entirely
the common law claims for civil conspiracy and unjust
enrichment. On September 26, 2002, the trial court denied
the consumer track plaintiffs’ motion for class
certification while granting the health care provider track
plaintiffs’



certification motion. Discovery commenced in both
tracks of the litigation on September 30, 2002. The
Eleventh Circuit granted the industry defendants’ petition
seeking review of the district court’s certification order
in the health care provider track litigation. On
February 24, 2003, the United States Supreme Court heard
argument in UnitedHealth Group’s and unaffiliated defendant
PacifiCare’s appeal to review the Southern District
Court’s decision (affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit) to
limit arbitration to only certain of the health care provider
track plaintiffs’ claims.

The American Medical Association et al. v.
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, United HealthCare Services,
Inc. and UnitedHealth Group.

This
lawsuit was filed on March 15, 2000, in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York. On April 13,
2000, we removed this case to the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. The suit alleges causes
of action based on ERISA, as well as breach of contract and the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts
and practices, and trade libel in connection with the
calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for
non-network providers. The suit seeks declaratory, injunctive
and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest
payments. An amended complaint was filed on August 25,
2000, which alleged two classes of plaintiffs, an ERISA class
and a non-ERISA class. After the Court dismissed certain ERISA
claims and the claims brought by the American Medical
Association, a third amended complaint was filed. On
October 25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in
part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. We are
engaged in discovery in this matter.

Because of the nature of our business, we are
routinely subject to lawsuits alleging various causes of action.
Some of these suits may include claims for substantial
non-economic, treble or punitive damages. We record liabilities
for our estimate of probable costs resulting from these matters.
Although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain,
we do not believe the results of any such actions, including
those described above, or any other types of actions, currently
threatened or pending, individually or in the aggregate, will
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Changes in and Disagreements with
    Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

On May 15, 2002, our Board of Directors and
the Audit Committee dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP as our
independent public accountants, effective May 15, 2002, and
engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, effective May 16,
2002, to serve as our independent auditors for fiscal year 2002.

Arthur Andersen’s reports on our
consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended
2001, 2000 and 1999 did not contain an adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

During the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999 and through May 15, 2002, there were no
disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting
principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Arthur
Andersen’s satisfaction, would have caused them to make
reference to the subject matter in connection with their report
on our consolidated financial statements for such years; and
there were no reportable events as defined in
Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

During the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000 and through May 15, 2002, we did not consult with
Deloitte & Touche with respect to the application of
accounting principles to a specified transaction, either
completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might
be rendered on our consolidated financial statements, or any
other matters or reportable events as set forth in
Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

We reported the change in accountants on a
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on May 16, 2002. The Form 8-K
contained a letter from Arthur Andersen LLP, addressed to the
SEC, stating that Arthur Andersen LLP agreed with the statements
concerning Arthur Andersen LLP contained in the Form 8-K.
This letter is filed as Exhibit 16 to this Form 10-K.
