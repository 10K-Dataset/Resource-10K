DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Uniprise

Uniprise serves the employee benefit needs of
large organizations by developing cost-effective health care
access and benefit strategies and programs, technology and
service-driven solutions tailored to the specific needs of each
customer. Uniprise offers consumers access to a wide spectrum of
health and well-being products and services. Together with its
affiliates, Uniprise’s core business provides
comprehensive, integrated health benefit services to
multi-location employers with more than 5,000 employees, and
specializes in large volume transaction management, large-scale
benefit design, and innovative technology



solutions designed to manage and control medical
care costs, facilitate access to care, and transform complex
administrative processes into simpler, efficient, high quality
automated processes. In addition to or as part of the functions
described above, Uniprise has developed Internet-based
administrative and financial applications for physician
inquiries and transactions, customer-specific data analysis for
employers, and consumer access to personal information and
services. Uniprise customers generally retain the risk of
financing the medical benefits of their employees and their
dependents, and Uniprise provides the management and
administrative services described above for a fixed fee per
members served.

Large employers can also access through Uniprise
all of UnitedHealth Group’s network-based medical,
insurance and specialty services, through a wide variety of
product arrangements. As of December 31, 2003, Uniprise
served over 320 clients, representing approximately
9.1 million individuals, including approximately 160 of the
Fortune 500 companies. Uniprise also provides claim, call and
other complex transaction processing services to consumers
served by UnitedHealthcare.

Health Care Services

Our Health Care Services segment consists of our
UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses.

UnitedHealthcare

UnitedHealthcare coordinates health and
well-being services on behalf of local employers and consumers
nationwide. UnitedHealthcare’s products are primarily
marketed to small and mid-size employers with up to 5,000
employees. As of December 31, 2003, this business served
approximately 8.3 million individuals. With its risk-based
product offerings, UnitedHealthcare assumes the risk of both
medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for
a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate for a
one-year period. UnitedHealthcare also provides administrative
and other management services to customers that self-insure the
medical costs of their employees and their dependents, for which
UnitedHealthcare receives a fee. These customers retain the risk
of financing medical benefits for their employees, and
UnitedHealthcare administers the payment of customer funds to
physicians and other health care providers from customer-funded
bank accounts. Small employer groups are more likely to purchase
risk-based products because they are generally unable or
unwilling to bear a greater potential liability for health care
expenditures. UnitedHealthcare offers its products through
affiliates that are usually licensed as insurance companies or
as health maintenance organizations, depending upon a variety of
factors, including state regulations.

UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access
to care through more than 400,000 physicians and 3,600 hospitals
across the United States. The consolidated purchasing power
represented by the individuals UnitedHealthcare serves makes it
possible for UnitedHealthcare to contract for cost-effective
access to a large number of conveniently located care providers.
Directly or through UnitedHealth Group’s family of
companies, UnitedHealthcare offers:



We believe that UnitedHealthcare’s
innovation distinguishes its product offerings from the
competition. UnitedHealthcare designs consumer-oriented health
benefits and services that value individual choice and control
in accessing health care. UnitedHealthcare has programs that
provide health education; admission counseling before hospital
stays; care advocacy to help avoid delays in patients’
stays in the hospital; support for individuals at risk of
needing intensive treatment; care coordination for people with
chronic conditions; and prescription drug management, which
promotes safe use of medications. UnitedHealthcare has designed
its programs to encourage consumers to be engaged and active
participants in managing their own health and well-being.
Further, UnitedHealthcare offers Web sites that provide access
to a variety of information, including a directory of network
physicians and hospitals, reports on thousands of health topics,
a treatment cost estimator, and a health profile tailored to
individual interests.

In November 2003, we acquired Golden
Rule Financial Corporation, a company which, through its
subsidiaries, offers a broad range of health and life insurance
and annuity products to the individual consumer market, with
approximately 430,000 individual members. Golden Rule is a
freestanding business unit within UnitedHealthcare.

In February 2004, we acquired Mid Atlantic
Medical Services, Inc. (MAMSI), a company which, through
its subsidiaries, provides health, administrative and
network-based services in the mid-Atlantic region of the United
States, directly serving approximately 955,000 people in
Maryland, Washington D.C., Virginia, Delaware, West Virginia,
northern North Carolina and southeast Pennsylvania.

Ovations

Ovations provides health and well-being services
for Americans age 50 and older, addressing their unique
needs for preventative and acute health care services, for
services dealing with chronic disease and for responding to
specialized issues relating to their overall well-being.
Ovations is one of few enterprises fully dedicated to this
market segment, providing products and services in all
50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands through licensed affiliates.

In January 1998, Ovations initiated a 10-year
contract with AARP, the nation’s largest organization for
older Americans. Ovations offers a range of health insurance
products and services to AARP members, and has expanded the
scope of services and programs offered over the past several
years.

Ovations operates the nation’s largest
Medicare Supplement business, providing Medicare Supplement and
hospital indemnity insurance, from its insurance company
affiliates, to approximately 3.8 million AARP members.
Ovations’ services also include an expanded AARP Nurse
Health Line Service to cover beneficiaries of all AARP Medicare
Supplement and certain hospital indemnity products, providing
24-hour access to health information from nurses. Ovations
developed an offering with lower cost Medicare Supplement
coverage that provides consumers with a hospital network and
24-hour access to health care information from nurses. During
2003, Ovations piloted a new health insurance program focused on
persons between 50 and 64 years of age. Ovations’
revenues from the AARP insurance offerings were approximately
$4.1 billion in 2003.

Ovations addresses one of the most significant
cost problems facing older Americans — prescription
drug costs. Ovations offers the nation’s largest pharmacy
discount card program, with approximately 1.8 million
users, providing access to retail and mail order pharmacy
services, and a complimentary health and well-being catalog
offering. These services offer cost savings and greater access
to prescription drugs and health and well-being products for
older Americans. Through its Group Retiree Solutions division,
Ovations offers innovative products for companies that provide
health care coverage to their retirees. Ovations Group Retiree
Solutions coordinates all Ovations group retiree sales
activities and spearheads new product development efforts for
group retiree coverage.

Ovations’ Senior & Retiree Services
division, through its affiliates, provides health care coverage
for the seniors market primarily through the Medicare Advantage
(formerly Medicare+Choice) program administered by the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). During 2003,
Ovations’ Senior & Retiree Services offered
13 new preferred provider organizations (PPO) pilot
projects in



10 states, in addition to its established
health plan products. Under these programs, Ovations provides
health insurance coverage to eligible Medicare beneficiaries in
exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS that
varies based on the geographic areas in which the members
reside. Through these programs, approximately 230,000 Medicare
beneficiaries were served as of December 31, 2003.

Through its Evercare® division, Ovations is
one of the nation’s leaders in offering complete,
individualized care planning and care benefits for aging,
vulnerable and chronically ill individuals, serving
approximately 65,000 persons across the nation in nursing homes,
community-based settings and private homes. Evercare offers a
continuum of services through innovative programs such as
EverCare Choice, EverCare Select and EverCare Connections.
EverCare Choice is a Medicare product that offers enhanced
medical coverage to frail, elderly and chronically ill
populations in both nursing homes and community settings. These
services are provided primarily through nurse practitioners,
physicians’ assistants and physicians. EverCare Select is a
Medicaid, long-term health care product for elderly, physically
disabled and other needy individuals. EverCare Connections is a
comprehensive eldercare service program providing service
coordination, consultation, claim management and information
resource nationwide.

AmeriChoice

AmeriChoice is a leading health care organization
engaged in facilitating health care benefits and services for
state Medicaid and other government-sponsored health care
programs and their beneficiaries, through its licensed
affiliates. AmeriChoice is a dedicated business unit of our
Health Care Services segment working exclusively with selected
states to address the needs of their medically vulnerable
populations under their Medicaid and other programs for the
uninsured. AmeriChoice provides health insurance coverage to
eligible Medicaid beneficiaries in exchange for a fixed monthly
premium per member from the applicable state. As of
December 31, 2003, AmeriChoice organized health care
resources and benefits for more than 1.1 million
beneficiaries of Medicaid and other government-sponsored health
care programs in 10 states through licensed affiliates.

Specialized Care Services

Specialized Care Services is a portfolio of
specialized health and well-being companies, each serving a
specific market need with an offering of benefits, provider
networks, services and resources. Specialized Care Services
provides comprehensive products and services that are focused on
highly specialized health care and financial assurance needs,

assistance, work life balance, critical care programs, disease

marketed under different brands through multiple sales channels,
including directly to employers, health plan insurers and
consumers and through affiliates, as well as on a private label
basis. Specialized Care Services’ products and services
include both risk-based products, in which Specialized Care
Services assumes financial responsibility for health care and
income replacement costs, and products for which Specialized
Care Services receives management and administrative fees.

Through United Behavioral Health
(“UBH”) and its affiliated companies, Specialized Care
Services provides behavioral health care benefit services,
employee assistance programs and psychiatric disability benefit
services. UBH’s care management capabilities and extensive
network of contracted mental health professionals represent the
core of its product offerings. UBH’s services and products

EXPANSION AND DIVESTITURE OF
OPERATIONS

We continually evaluate expansion opportunities
in all our businesses and, in the normal course of business,
often consider whether to sell certain businesses or stop
offering certain products or services. Expansion opportunities
may include acquiring businesses that are complementary to our
existing operations. We also devote significant attention to
internally developing new products and services for the health
and well-being sector as we have broadly defined it. During
2003, we completed several acquisitions and ceased offering some
products in certain markets, all as part of our ongoing emphasis
on our strategic focus.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Most of our health and well-being services are
regulated. This regulation can vary significantly from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Federal and state regulatory
agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and
interpret and enforce laws and rules. Changes in applicable laws
and regulations are continually being considered, and the
interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change
periodically. These revisions could affect our consolidated
operations and financial results. Enactment of federal and state
health benefit laws and regulations can also affect our
businesses.

Federal Regulation

Our Health Care Services segment, which includes
UnitedHealthcare, Ovations, and AmeriChoice. Ovations has
Medicare Advantage contracts that are regulated by CMS. CMS has
the right to audit our performance in order to determine
compliance with CMS’ contracts and regulations and the
quality of care being given to members. Our Health Care Services
segment also has Medicaid and State Children’s Health
Insurance Program contracts that are subject to federal and
state regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid
enrollees, payment for those services, and other aspects of
these programs. There is a significant level of regulation
surrounding Medicare and Medicaid compliance. In addition,
because a portion of Ingenix’ business includes clinical
research, it is subject to regulation by the FDA. We believe we
are in compliance with the applicable regulations. We believe we
are in compliance with these regulations.

State Regulation

All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer
insurance and health maintenance products regulate those
products and operations. These states require periodic financial
reports from us and impose minimum capital or restricted cash
reserve requirements. Many of our health plans and each of our
insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance
holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require
registration with applicable state Departments of Insurance and
the filing of reports that describe capital structure,
ownership, financial condition, certain inter-company
transactions and general business operations. Some state
insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior
regulatory approval of acquisitions and material inter-company
transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the
regulated companies and their parent holding companies or
affiliates. In addition, some of our subsidiaries or products
may be subject to PPO, managed care organization
(“MCO”) or TPA-related regulations and licensure
requirements. These regulations differ greatly from state to
state, but generally contain network, contracting, product and
rate, financial and reporting requirements. Many states also
have enacted laws and/or adopted regulations governing
utilization review and external appeals activities, and these
laws may apply to some of our operations. Additionally, there
are laws and regulations that set specific standards for



delivery of services, prompt payment of claims,
confidentiality of consumer health information and covered
benefits and services.

HIPAA

The administrative simplification provisions of
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
as amended (“HIPAA”), apply to both the group and
individual health insurance markets, including self-funded
employee benefit plans. Federal regulations promulgated pursuant
to HIPAA are now effective. These regulations include minimum
standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the
privacy and security of protected health information. We believe
that we are in compliance with these regulations. New standards
for national provider and employer identifiers are currently
being developed by regulators. We intend to be in compliance by
the enforcement dates. However, where the law is far-reaching
and complex or the government delays in providing guidance on
some aspects of the law, the timeliness of our compliance
efforts may be affected. Additionally, different approaches to
HIPAA’s provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in
the different states may adversely affect our ability to
standardize our products and services across state lines.

ERISA

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (“ERISA”), regulates how goods and
services are provided to or through certain types of
employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a complex set
of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic
interpretation by the United States Department of Labor as well
as the federal courts. ERISA places controls on how our business
units may do business with employers who sponsor employee
benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain
self-funded plans. During 2003, we processed and administered
the payment of approximately $25 billion of medical claims
on behalf of customers that self-insure the medical costs of
their employees and their employees’ dependents. ERISA
claim regulations which became effective July 2002 require
ongoing modifications to our operations. We believe that we are
in compliance with the regulations.

Fraud and Abuse

The regulations and contractual requirements
applicable to participants in federal government health care
programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are complex and changing.
We continue to emphasize our regulatory compliance efforts for
these programs, but ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the
highly technical nature of the regulations mean that compliance
efforts in this arena will continue to require significant
resources. Additionally, states have begun to focus their
anti-fraud efforts on insurance companies and health maintenance
organizations. Some states now require filing and approval of
anti-fraud plans and may monitor compliance as part of any
market conduct examination. We believe that we are in compliance
with these regulations and contractual requirements.

Audits and Investigations

We are regularly subject to governmental audits,
investigations and enforcement actions. Any such government
actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal
fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of
licensure or exclusion from participation in government
programs. In addition, a state Department of Insurance or other
state or federal authority (including CMS, the Office of the
Inspector General and state attorneys general) may from time to
time begin a special audit of one of our health plans, our
insurance plans or one of our other operations to investigate
issues such as utilization management; financial, eligibility or
other data reporting; prompt claims payment; or coverage
determinations for medical services, including emergency room
care. We are currently involved in various governmental
investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine,
regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS,
state insurance departments and state attorneys general, the
Office of Personnel Management, the Office of the Inspector
General, the Office of Civil Rights, and U.S. Attorneys. We
do not believe the results of any of the current investigations,
audits or reviews,



individually or in the aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

International Regulation

Our Ingenix, Uniprise and Health Care Services
segments have limited international operations. These
international operations are subject to different legal and
regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions, including
various tax, tariff and trade regulations, as well as
employment, intellectual property and investment rules and laws.

MARKETING

Our marketing strategy is defined and coordinated
by each business’ dedicated marketing staff. Within these
businesses, primary marketing responsibility generally resides
with a marketing leader and a direct sales force. In addition,
several of the segments also rely upon independent insurance
agents and brokers to sell some of their products. Marketing
efforts also include public relations efforts and advertising
programs that may use television, radio, newspapers, magazines,
billboards, direct mail and telemarketing.

COMPETITION

As a diversified health and well-being services
company we operate in highly competitive markets. Our
competitors include managed health care companies, insurance
companies, third party administrators and business services
outsourcing companies, health care providers that have formed
networks to directly contract with employers, specialty benefit
providers, government entities, and various information and
consulting companies. For our Uniprise and Health Care Services
businesses, competitors include Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Coventry,
Humana, PacifiCare, Oxford, WellPoint, numerous for profit and
not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the
Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other enterprises
concentrated in more limited geographic areas. Our Specialized
Care Services and Ingenix business segments also compete with a
number of businesses. New entrants into the markets in which we
compete, as well as consolidation within these markets, also
contribute to a competitive environment. We believe the
principal competitive factors affecting us and the sales and
pricing of our products and services include product innovation,
consumer satisfaction, the level and quality of products and
services, network capabilities, price, market share, product
distribution systems, efficient administration operations,
financial strength and marketplace reputation.

We believe that our competitive strengths are
enhanced by our customer focus resulting from our operational
alignment. Each UnitedHealth Group business represents a
strategic platform from which we can penetrate more deeply into
specific markets using our three core competencies: network
management, knowledge and information and service
infrastructure. Other strengths include the breadth and quality
of our products, our geographic scope and diversity, the scope
and depth of our data and information about health care costs
and consumption, our effective use of proprietary tools and
products to coordinate and facilitate programs designed to
realize appropriately lower health care costs, our disciplined
underwriting and pricing practices and staff, our significant
market position in certain geographic areas, the strength of our
distribution network, our financial strength, our generally
large provider networks that provide more consumer choice and
minimize barriers to access, our point-of-service products and
our strong marketplace reputation. However, in some markets we
may be at a disadvantage for a number of reasons, including
competitors with more resources, longer operating histories,
larger market shares, broader networks, narrower networks (which
may allow greater cost control and lower prices) or more
established names and reputations.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2003, we employed
approximately 33,000 individuals. We believe our employee
relations are favorable.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

The statements contained in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, and in the Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
other sections of our Annual Report to Shareholders incorporated
by reference in this Form 10-K, include forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”). When used
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by
us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press
releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and
in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our
executive officers, the words or phrases “believes,”
“anticipates,” “intends,” “will likely
result,” “estimates,” “projects” or
similar expressions are intended to identify such
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual
results to differ materially from the results discussed in the
forward-looking statements.

The following discussion contains certain
cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and
others should consider. This discussion is intended to take
advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the
PSLRA. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal
securities laws, in making these cautionary statements, we do
not undertake to address or update each factor in future filings
or communications regarding our business or operating results,
and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may
have caused results to differ from discussions or information
contained in previous filings or communications. In addition,
any of the matters discussed below may have affected our past,
as well as current, forward-looking statements about future
results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this
Form 10-K, in the 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders, and
in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong.
They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or
by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors
discussed below will be important in determining future results.
Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.
Actual future results may vary materially from expectations
expressed in our prior communications.

We must effectively manage our health care
costs.

Under risk-based product arrangements, we assume
the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our
customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from
risk-based products (excluding AARP) comprise approximately 75%
of our total consolidated revenues. We use approximately 80% to
85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care
services delivered to our customers. The profitability of our
risk-based products depends in large part on our ability to
accurately predict, price for, and effectively manage health
care costs. Total health care costs are affected by the number
of individual services rendered and the cost of each service.
Our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12-month
period and is generally priced one to four months before
contract commencement. Services are delivered and related costs
are incurred when the contract commences. Although we base the
premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs
over the fixed premium period, inflation, regulations and other
factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and
reflected in premiums. These factors may include increased use
of services, increased cost of individual services,
catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly
treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other
regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and
seasonal changes in the level of health care use. Relatively
small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as
a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant
changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs
increased by one percent for UnitedHealthcare’s commercial
insured products, our annual net earnings for 2003 would have
been reduced by approximately $75 million. In addition, the
financial results we report for any particular period include
estimates of costs incurred for which the underlying claims have
not been received by us or for which the claims have been
received but not processed. If these estimates prove too high or
too low, the effect of the change will be included in future
results.



We face intense competition in many of our
markets and customers have flexibility in moving between
competitors.

Our businesses compete throughout the United
States and face significant competition in all of the geographic
markets in which they operate. For our Uniprise and Health Care
Services businesses, competitors include Aetna, Anthem, Cigna,
Coventry, Humana, PacifiCare, Oxford, WellPoint, numerous for
profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses
from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other
enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas. Our
Specialized Care Services and Ingenix businesses also compete
with a number of businesses. Moreover, we believe that barriers
to entry in many markets are not substantial, so the addition of
new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy
significant flexibility in moving between competitors. In
particular markets, these competitors may have capabilities that
give them a competitive advantage. Greater market share,
established reputation, superior supplier arrangements, existing
business relationships, and other factors all can provide a
competitive advantage. In addition, significant merger and
acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we
operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers in these
industries. This level of consolidation makes it more difficult
for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on
which we do business with our suppliers, and to maintain or
advance profitability.

Our relationship with AARP is significant to
our Ovations business.

Under our 10-year contract with AARP which we
entered into in 1998, we provide Medicare Supplement and
Hospital Indemnity health insurance and other products to AARP
members. As of December 31, 2003, our portion of
AARP’s insurance program represented approximately
$4.1 billion in annual net premium revenue from
approximately 3.8 million AARP members. The AARP contract
may be terminated early by us or AARP under certain
circumstances, including a material breach by either party,
insolvency of either party, a material adverse change in the
financial condition of either party, and by mutual agreement.
The success of our AARP arrangement depends, in part, on our
ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional
products and services, price the products and services
competitively, and respond effectively to federal and state
regulatory changes. Additionally, events that adversely affect
AARP or one of its other business partners for its member
insurance program could have an adverse effect on the success of
our arrangement with AARP. For example, if customers were
dissatisfied with the products AARP offered or its reputation,
if federal legislation limited opportunities in the Medicare
market, or if the services provided by AARP’s other
business partners were unacceptable, our business could be
adversely affected.

The effects of the new Medicare reform
legislation on our business are uncertain.

Recently enacted Medicare reform legislation is
complex and wide-ranging. There are numerous provisions in the
legislation that will influence our business, although at this
early stage, it is difficult to predict the extent to which our
business will be affected. While uncertain as to impact, we
believe the increased funding provided in the legislation will
intensify competition in the seniors health services market.

Our business is subject to intense government
scrutiny and we must respond quickly and appropriately to
frequent changes in government regulations.

Our business is regulated at the federal, state,
local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our
business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject
to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies
administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and
rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict
revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and
administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our
liability in federal and state courts for coverage
determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We
must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of
our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products
and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions. Delays in
obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals
could reduce our revenue or increase our costs.



We participate in federal, state and local
government health care coverage programs. These programs
generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that
may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce
the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our
administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such
changes have adversely affected our financial results and
willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may
do so in the future.

State legislatures and Congress continue to focus
on health care issues. Legislative and regulatory proposals at
state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our
business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and
other health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods
and payment rates; coverage determinations; claim payments and
processing; use and maintenance of individually identifiable
health information; and government-sponsored programs. We cannot
predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become
binding law or regulation, or, if enacted, what their terms will
be, but their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to
expanded liability, require us to revise the ways in which we
conduct business or put us at risk for a loss of business.

We are also subject to various governmental
investigations, audits and reviews. Such oversight could result
in our loss of licensure or our right to participate in certain
programs, or the imposition of civil or criminal fines,
penalties and other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any
adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage
our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for
us to sell our products and services. We are currently involved
in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews.
These include routine, regular and special investigations,
audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, state insurance and health and welfare departments and
state attorneys general, the Office of Personnel Management, the
Office of the Inspector General and U.S. Attorney General.

We depend on our relationships with
physicians, hospitals and other health care providers.

We contract with physicians, hospitals,
pharmaceutical benefit service providers and pharmaceutical
manufacturers, and other health care providers for favorable
prices. A number of organizations are advocating for legislation
that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care
professionals from federal and state antitrust laws. In any
particular market, these physicians and health care
professionals could refuse to contract, demand higher payments,
or take other actions that could result in higher health care
costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty
meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some
markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals,
physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician
groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies
that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part.

The nature of our business exposes us to
significant litigation risks and our insurance coverage may not
be sufficient to cover some of the costs associated with
litigation.

Periodically, we become a party to the types of
legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment
and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit
claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder
suits, and intellectual property-related litigation. In
addition, because of the nature of our business, we are
routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to
the design, management and offerings of our services. These
matters include, but are not limited to, claims related to
health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions,
contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain
business practices. In 1999, a number of class action lawsuits
were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the
health benefits business. The suits are purported class actions
on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal
statutes, including ERISA and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organization Act (“RICO”). Although the expenses which
we have incurred to date in defending the 1999 class action
lawsuits have not been material to our business, we will
continue to incur expenses in the defense of the 1999 class
action litigation and other matters, even if they are without
merit.



Following the events of September 11, 2001,
the cost of business insurance coverage has increased
significantly. As a result, we have increased the amount of risk
that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters
incidental to our business. We believe that we are adequately
insured for claims in excess of our self-insurance; however,
certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, are not
covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of
the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters. Although
we believe the liabilities established for these risks are
adequate, it is possible that the level of actual losses may
exceed the liabilities recorded.

Our businesses depend significantly on
effective information systems and the integrity of the data in
our information systems.

Our ability to adequately price our products and
services, provide effective and efficient service to our
customers, and to accurately report our financial results
depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our
information systems. As a result of our acquisition activities,
we have acquired additional systems. We have been taking steps
to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and
expanded our information systems capabilities. If the
information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be
inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively
our information systems and data integrity, we could lose
existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers,
have problems in determining medical cost estimates and
establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician
and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory
problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other
adverse consequences.

We depend on independent third parties, such as
IBM and Medco Health Solutions, Inc., with whom we have
entered into agreements, for significant portions of our data
center operations and pharmacy benefits management and
processing, respectively. Even though we have appropriate
provisions in our agreement with IBM and Medco, including
provisions with respect to specific performance standards,
covenants, warranties, audit rights, indemnification, and other
provisions, our dependence on these third parties makes our
operations vulnerable to their failure to perform adequately
under the contracts, due to internal or external factors.
Although there are a limited number of service organizations
with the size, scale and capabilities to effectively provide
certain of these services, especially with regard to pharmacy
benefits processing and management, we believe that other
organizations could provide similar services on comparable
terms. A change in service providers, however, could result in a
decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable
contract terms.

We must comply with emerging restrictions on
patient privacy, including taking steps to ensure compliance by
our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient
information when providing services to us.

The use of individually identifiable data by our
businesses is regulated at international, federal and state
levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by
legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws
address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable
health data. Most are derived from the privacy provisions in the
federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and HIPAA. HIPAA also imposes
guidelines on our business associates (as this term is defined
in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for
appropriate protections through our contracts with our business
associates, we still have limited control over their actions and
practices. Compliance with these proposals and new regulations
may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes,
the development of new administrative processes, and the effects
of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also
may impose further restrictions on our use of patient
identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our
administrative databases.

Our knowledge and information-related
businesses depend significantly on our ability to maintain
proprietary rights to our databases and related
products.

We rely on our agreements with customers,
confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade
secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary
rights. These legal protections and precautions



may not prevent misappropriation of our
proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation
regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software
industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly
subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of
products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such
litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information
could hinder our ability to market and sell products and
services.

The effects of the war on terror and future
terrorist attacks could have a severe impact on the health care
industry.

The terrorist attacks launched on
September 11, 2001, the war on terrorism, the threat of
future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers
and providers have negatively affected, and may continue to
negatively affect, the U.S. economy in general and our
industry specifically. Depending on the government’s
actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and
insurance companies, future acts of terrorism and bio-terrorism
could lead to, among other things, increased use of health care
services including, without limitation, hospital and physician
services; loss of membership in health plans we administer as a
result of lay-offs or other reductions of employment; adverse
effects upon the financial condition or business of employers
who sponsor health care coverage for their employees; disruption
of our information and payment systems; increased health care
costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain
categories of risk, such as acts of terrorism; and disruption of
the financial and insurance markets in general.

The market price of our common stock may be
particularly sensitive due to the nature of the business in
which we operate.

The market prices of the securities of the
publicly-held companies in the industry in which we operate have
shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many external
factors, including general market trends, public communications
regarding managed care, litigation and judicial decisions,
legislative or regulatory actions, health care cost trends,
pricing trends, competition, earnings, membership reports of
particular industry participants and acquisition activity.
Despite our specific outlook or prospects, the market price of
our common stock may decline as a result of any of these
external factors. By way of illustration, our stock price has
ranged from $35.33 on December 31, 2001 to $58.18 on
December 31, 2003 (as adjusted to reflect stock splits and
dividends).

Item 2.

Properties

As of December 31, 2003, we leased
approximately 6.6 million and owned approximately 250,000
aggregate square feet of space in the United States and Europe.
Our leases expire at various dates through May 31, 2025.
Our various segments use this space exclusively for their
respective business purposes and we believe these current
facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are
adequate for our anticipated future needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In Re: Managed Care Litigation: MDL
No. 1334.

Beginning in 1999, a
series of class action lawsuits were filed against us and
virtually all major entities in the health benefits business. A
multi-district litigation panel has consolidated several
litigation cases involving UnitedHealth Group and our affiliates
in the Southern District Court of Florida, Miami division. In
December 2000, the UnitedHealth Group litigation was
consolidated with litigation involving other industry members.
Generally, the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations
of ERISA and RICO in connection with alleged undisclosed
policies intended to maximize profits. Other allegations include
breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract
claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical
services rendered. The consolidated suits seek injunctive,
compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution, costs,
fees and interest payments. Discovery commenced on
September 30, 2002. In November 2002, the Eleventh Circuit
granted the industry defendants’ petition to review the
class certification order. That appeal is pending. On
April 7, 2003, the United States Supreme Court determined
that the RICO claims against PacifiCare and



UnitedHealthcare should be arbitrated. On
September 15, 2003, the district court granted in part and
denied in part the industry defendants’ further motion to
compel arbitration. Significantly, the court denied the industry
defendants’ motion with respect to plaintiffs’
derivative RICO claims. On September 19, 2003, the industry
defendants appealed the district court’s arbitration order
to the Eleventh Circuit. A trial date has been set for
September 13, 2004.

The American Medical Association et al.
v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, United HealthCare
Services, Inc. and UnitedHealth
Group.

This lawsuit was filed on
March 15, 2000, in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York. On April 13, 2000,
we removed this case to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. The suit alleges causes of
action based on ERISA, as well as breach of contract and the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts
and practices, and trade libel in connection with the
calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for
non-network providers. The suit seeks declaratory, injunctive
and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest
payments. An amended complaint was filed on August 25,
2000, which alleged two classes of plaintiffs, an ERISA class
and a non-ERISA class. After the Court dismissed certain ERISA
claims and the claims brought by the American Medical
Association, a third amended complaint was filed. On
October 25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in
part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. We are
engaged in discovery in this matter.

Because of the nature of our business, we are
routinely subject to lawsuits alleging various causes of action.
Some of these suits may include claims for substantial
non-economic, treble or punitive damages. We record liabilities
for our estimate of probable costs resulting from these matters.
Although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain,
we do not believe the results of any such actions, including
those described above, or any other types of actions, currently
threatened or pending, individually or in the aggregate, will
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Changes in and Disagreements with
    Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

On May 15, 2002, our Board of Directors and
the Audit Committee ended the Company’s engagement with
Arthur Andersen LLP as our independent public accountants,
effective May 15, 2002, and engaged Deloitte &
Touche LLP, effective May 16, 2002, to serve as our
independent auditors for fiscal year 2002.

Arthur Andersen’s reports on our
consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended
2001, 2000 and 1999 did not contain an adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

During the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999 and through May 15, 2002, there were no
disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting
principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Arthur
Andersen’s satisfaction, would have caused them to make
reference to the subject matter in connection with their report
on our consolidated financial statements for such years; and
there were no reportable events as defined in
Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

During the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000 and through May 15, 2002, we did not consult with
Deloitte & Touche with respect to the application of
accounting principles to a specified transaction, either
completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might
be rendered on our consolidated financial statements, or any
other matters or reportable events as set forth in
Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

We reported the change in accountants on a
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on May 16, 2002. The Form 8-K
contained a letter from Arthur Andersen LLP, addressed to the
SEC, stating that Arthur Andersen LLP agreed with the statements
concerning Arthur Andersen LLP contained in the Form 8-K.
This letter is filed as Exhibit 16 to this Form 10-K.

Item 9A.

design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting During the Quarter Ended December 31,

There were no significant changes in our internal
