PART I

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

Our Company

Align Technology, Inc. was incorporated in April 1997
under the laws of the state of Delaware. We design, manufacture and market the
Invisalign® system, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the
misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of
clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a
desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic
brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other
limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating
adults and teens with mature dentition. Align Technology received FDA clearance
to market Invisalign in 1998.

Under the Corporate
Information/Investor Relations section of our corporate website which can be
accessed at either

www.aligntech.com

or

www.invisalign.com

, we make our annual
report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K, our proxy statement on Schedule 14-A for
our annual stockholders’ meeting and amendments to such reports available as
soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or
furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. All such filings
are available free of charge. The information in, or that can be accessed
through, our web site is not part of this report.


Industry Background

Malocclusion

Malocclusion, the
misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions,
affecting over 200 million individuals, or approximately 75% of the U.S.
population. Approximately two million people annually elect treatment by
orthodontists in the U.S. While most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to
improve their appearance, malocclusion may also be responsible for dental
problems such as tooth decay, tooth loss, gum disease, jaw joint pain and
headaches. Because of the compromised aesthetics, discomfort and other
drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments, only a
relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek traditional
treatment.

Traditional
Orthodontic Treatment

In the U.S., dental professionals treat malocclusion
primarily with metal archwires and brackets, commonly referred to as braces. Occasionally,
dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic,
tooth-colored brackets or bond brackets on the inside, or lingual
surfaces, of the patient’s teeth. Dental professionals also augment braces with
elastics, metal bands, headgear and other ancillary devices.

The average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24
months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional
involvement, or chair time. To initiate treatment, a dental professional will
diagnose a patient’s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan. In a
subsequent visit, the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient’s
teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets. Thereafter, by
tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks, the
dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient’s teeth to
achieve desired tooth movement. Because of the length of time between visits,
the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve
sustained tooth movement during the interval. In a final visit, the dental
professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient’s teeth.

Fees for traditional
orthodontic treatment typically range between U.S. $3,500 to $7,000 with a median
fee of approximately $4,800; generally only a portion of the fees are
reimbursed by insurance, if covered at all. In addition, dental professionals
commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives. Fees are based
on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional’s
estimate of chair time, and are generally negotiated in advance. A treatment
that exceeds the dental professional’s estimate of chair time generally results
in decreased fees per hour of chair time, or reduced profitability for the
dental professional.

Limitations of
Traditional Orthodontic Treatment

Although braces are
generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions, they are
subject to many limitations and disadvantages. Conventional orthodontic
treatment is associated with:

·

Unattractive appearance

.   Braces call attention to the
patient’s condition and treatment. In addition, braces trap food, which can
further compromise appearance. Braces can also result in permanent
discoloration of teeth. Many adults associate braces with adolescence. As a
result of these and other limitations, less than one percent of American adults
with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment annually.

·

Oral discomfort

.   Braces are sharp and bulky and can
abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth. The tightening or
adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort,
especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit.


·

Poor oral hygiene

.   Braces compromise oral hygiene by
making it more difficult to brush and floss. These problems can result in tooth
decay and periodontal damage. Additionally, the bonding of brackets to teeth
can cause permanent markings on the teeth.

·

Inability to project treatment

.   Historically, dental
professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course
of treatment. Accordingly, dental professionals must rely on intuition and
judgment to plan and project treatment. As a result, they cannot be precise
about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient
visits. This lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and
can limit the dental professional’s ability to estimate the duration of
treatment. Because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price
basis, extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the dental
professional.

·

Physical demands on dental professional

.   The
manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and
visual acuity, and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional.

·

Root resorption

.   The sustained high levels of force
associated with conventional treatment can result in root resorption, which is
a shortening of tooth roots. This shortening can have substantial adverse
periodontal consequences for the patient.

·

Emergencies

.   At times, braces need to be repaired or
replaced on an emergency basis. Such emergencies cause significant
inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional.

Due to the poor
aesthetics, discomfort and other limitations of braces, relatively few people
with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment. Accordingly, we
believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses
these patient concerns. We also believe there is an unmet need among dental
professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and
efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability.

The Align Solution

Invisalign (which includes full Invisalign treatment
and Invisalign® Express discussed below under “Our Products”) is a proprietary
system for treating malocclusion. The Invisalign treatment process is comprised
of several phases, the principal steps of which are: the creation of electronic
treatment plans using ClinCheck® and the manufacturing of Invisalign aligners
(referred to in this Form 10-K as “Aligners”). The complete
Invisalign treatment process is described in greater detail under “Business—The
Invisalign Treatment Process”.

ClinCheck.

ClinCheck
is an internally developed computer modeling program that allows dental
professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients. We use a
dental impression and a treatment form submitted by a dental professional to
develop a customized, three-dimensional treatment plan that simulates
appropriate tooth movement in a series of two-week increments. ClinCheck
allows the dental professional to view this three-dimensional simulation
with a high degree of magnification and from any angle. Accordingly, ClinCheck
enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of
accuracy not previously possible.

Upon review of the ClinCheck simulation, the dental
professional may immediately approve the projected treatment, or may provide us
with feedback for modification. We reflect any requested adjustments in a
modified simulation. Upon the dental professional’s approval of the ClinCheck
simulation, we use the data underlying the simulation, in conjunction with
stereolithography technology, to manufacture Aligner molds. A third party
shelter services provider in Juarez, Mexico uses these molds to fabricate the
patient’s Aligners.


Aligners.

Aligners
are custom-manufactured, thin, clear plastic, removable dental appliances
that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two-week stage of the
ClinCheck simulation. Aligners are customized to perform the treatment
prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using ClinCheck. Each
Aligner covers a patient’s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn. Aligners
are commonly worn in pairs, over the upper and lower dental arches. Aligners
are generally worn for consecutive two-week periods which correspond to
the approved ClinCheck treatment simulation. After two weeks of use, the
patient replaces them with the next pair in the series. This process is
repeated until the final Aligners are used and treatment is complete. Upon
completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or her
discretion, have the patient use an Invisalign retainer or go directly to a
conventional retainer.

Our Products

The vast majority of our revenue is generated from the
sale of full Invisalign treatment and Invisalign® Express treatment. Approximately
5% of our revenue is generated by the sale of training and the sale of
ancillary products.

Full
Invisalign Treatment.

Commercial
sales of full Invisalign treatment commenced in the U.S. in July 1999. Our
traditional, full Invisalign treatment option is intended to be used as a
complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions. Each treatment plan is
unique to the individual patient and the treatment plan will consist of as many
Aligners as is necessary to achieve the doctor’s treatment goals.

Invisalign Express.

In the third quarter of 2005, we launched Invisalign
Express, a lower-cost solution for less complex orthodontic cases. Invisalign
Express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment consisting of up to ten Aligners. Invisalign
Express is intended to help a broader range of patients elect orthodontic
treatment by providing a lower-cost option for adult relapse cases, for minor
crowding and spacing, and as a pre-cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatment
such as veneers.

Benefits of Invisalign

We believe that Invisalign
provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential
to establish Invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces.

Benefits to the
dental professional

·

Ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes

.   ClinCheck
enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely
outcome of treatment in an interactive three-dimensional computer model. ClinCheck
allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before
selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient.

·

Begin using Invisalign with minimal additional training

.   The
biomechanical principles that underlie treatment with the Invisalign system are
consistent with those of traditional orthodontics. Dental professionals can
complete our initial training within two days. We provide additional clinical
support following the initial training and encourage dental professionals to
attend continuing education classes, seminars and workshops.

·

Expanded patient base

.   We believe that Invisalign has
the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics. Currently, approximately
two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the U.S. These
patients represent approximately 1 percent of the population of people with
malocclusion. Of these, we estimate approximately 40 percent, or approximately
800,000 patients have mature dentition with mild to moderate malocclusion and
are therefore potential candidates


for Invisalign. We believe
that Invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would
not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment.

·

Decreased dental professional and staff time

.   Invisalign
eliminates the need for time-intensive processes such as bonding
appliances to the patient’s teeth, adjusting archwires during the course of
treatment and removing the appliances at the conclusion of treatment. As such,
use of Invisalign reduces dental professional and staff chair time and can
increase practice throughput.

·

Practice
productivity

.   We believe that as dental professionals move to
a higher volume of Invisalign patients, they will be able to better leverage
their existing resources, including office space and staff time, resulting in
an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity.

Benefits to the
Patient

·

Excellent aesthetics

.   Aligners are nearly invisible
when worn, significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with
conventional braces.

·

Comfort

.   By replacing the six-week adjustment
cycle of traditional braces with two-week stages, Aligners move teeth
more gently than conventional braces. Also, Aligners are thin, smooth and low
in profile. As a result, Aligners are substantially more comfortable and less
abrasive than conventional braces.

·

Improved oral hygiene

.   Patients can remove Aligners
for tasks that are difficult with conventional braces, such as eating, brushing
and flossing. We believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay
and periodontal damage during treatment, which may result from conventional
braces.

·

Potentially reduced overall treatment time

.   Aligners
control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth.
In addition, the ClinCheck simulation from which Aligners are produced is
designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements. Together, these
factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to conventional braces.

·

Potentially reduced root resorption

.   We believe that
controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the
incidence of root resorption, which is the breakdown or destruction of root
structure.

·

Reduced incidence of emergencies

.   Typically, a lost or
broken Aligner is simply replaced with the next Aligner in the treatment
series, minimizing inconvenience to both patient and dental professional.

We believe that these
benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment
because of the limitations of conventional braces.

Limitations of Invisalign

In some instances, the
Invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to conventional
treatment. Aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces, and we
charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used
in conventional treatment. Depending on the individual pricing policies of each
dental professional, the cost of full Invisalign treatment to the patient may
be greater than for conventional braces. Dental professionals must also
incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan. Once
a dental professional submits a case to us, there is generally a turn-around
time of a month or more before the corresponding Aligners are delivered. Aligners
may not be appropriate for all cases, such as severe malocclusion, which may
require Aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal
results. In addition, because Aligners are removable, treatment using
Invisalign depends on patients wearing their Aligners as recommended. Some
patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing Aligners
that may mildly affect speech. In


some
instances, patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums, cheeks and
lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have occurred. We believe
that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of
Invisalign to both patients and dental professionals.

Our Target Market
and Patient Base

Medical devices are classified into one of three
classes based on the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and
effectiveness. Class I or II devices require the manufacturer to submit a
pre-market notification to the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA,
requesting permission for commercial distribution, which is known as 510(k) clearance.
We obtained our 510(k) clearance in September 1998. Our 510(k) clearance
allows us to market Invisalign to treat patients with any type of malocclusion
provided that the patient has mature dentition. We currently restrict the use
of Invisalign to adults and teens with mature dentition. Individuals with
mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially completed
jaw growth, which typically occurs between the ages of 11 and 15 years. We do
not treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing, as the
effectiveness of Invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the
movement of teeth over the course of treatment. Based on our clinical studies
to date, we recommend that dental professionals use Invisalign as a complete
treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment
for severe malocclusions. Approximately two million people annually elect
treatment by orthodontists in the U.S. These patients represent approximately
one percent of the population of people with malocclusion. Of these, we
estimate 40 percent, or more than 800,000 patients, have mature dentition and
are therefore potential candidates for Invisalign. Our market research
indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire
treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations. We
believe that, since Invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces,
persons with malocclusion will be more likely to seek treatment. We believe
that adults, who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of
traditional treatment, represent our most immediate and significant market
expansion opportunity.

In an effort to more fully penetrate our target
market, in August 2005, we launched Invisalign Express, a lower-cost
solution for less complex cases. Invisalign Express is a simple, dual arch
orthodontic treatment consisting of up to ten Aligners. We expect Invisalign
Express will increase the overall market for Invisalign, as patients who would
not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment due to its relatively high cost
are introduced to this lower-cost treatment option. We continue to market and
sell our traditional full Invisalign treatment option for more complex cases.

As of December 31, 2005, approximately 380,000
patients worldwide have started treatment using Invisalign. Internationally, we
operate in the geographic regions of Europe, Asia-Pacific, Japan and Latin
America. In 2005, international sales accounted for 12% of our net revenues.

In each of fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total
revenues.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to
establish Invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic
malocclusion through customer responsiveness, product leadership and
operational effectiveness. Key elements of our strategy include the following.

Customer
Responsiveness

Focus
on education and customer support.

In
order to build long-term relationships with our customers, we focus on
delivering superior training, support and services. Each year, we provide
numerous clinical education and training programs, which include certification
classes, conference calls, seminars and workshops. By participating in these
events, we believe that our customers will emerge with a better


understanding of the
product and its applicability, and with a greater awareness for starting and
finishing Invisalign cases. We also maintain an online clinical education
center which is intended to augment our training workshops, conference calls
and seminars by enabling Invisalign-trained doctors to obtain continuing
education credits and access a full range of case studies and best practices.

Educate
future orthodontists and general practitioners.

By educating dental students and orthodontic
residents on the benefits of the Invisalign technique, we believe they will be
more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer
Invisalign as a treatment option. Currently, we have incorporated the
Invisalign technique into selected orthodontic and dental undergraduate
curriculums. In 2006, we intend to continue the integration of Invisalign into
the programs of additional universities and post-graduate institutions.

Stimulate
demand for Invisalign treatment.

Our market
research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who
desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many
limitations, such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort. By
communicating the benefits of Invisalign to both dental professionals and
consumers, we intend to increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic
treatment annually. In the second quarter of 2005, we launched a new consumer
marketing campaign designed to raise the profile of Invisalign and drive more
consumers to our most experienced dental professionals. As of December 31,
2005, we had trained approximately 35,800 dental professionals worldwide on the
use and benefits of Invisalign.

Improving
the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and GPs.

We
have two customer channels: the orthodontist and the general practitioner
dentist, or GP. Although we have historically generated a majority of our
revenues from orthodontists, there exists a significantly greater number of GPs
in North America than orthodontists. As the primary care dental provider, GPs
have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists, and possess a
unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to Invisalign.
GPs also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and, in
certain instances, may choose to treat less complex cases themselves. We are
committed to improving the collaboration and referral relationships between
orthodontists and GPs. We continue to support study clubs, which pair
experienced orthodontists with less experienced GPs. These orthodontists
act as mentors to the GPs and lend them support and guidance in their
Invisalign practice. Through these study
clubs, GPs are introduced to an experienced Invisalign
practitioner and are able to refer appropriate cases to these orthodontists. We
believe that improved collaboration is beneficial to the orthodontist and the
GP and will accelerate growth in Invisalign cases and consequently increase our
revenues. As specialists, orthodontists are a critical part of our business,
and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex
cases and continue to drive research for expanding Invisalign applications. We
expect, however, that that the percentage of revenue generated by GPs will
increase, largely due to the fact that there are significantly more GPs than
orthodontists. We believe the expected increase in the number of cases treated
by GPs will result in an increase in the overall market for Invisalign as
patients that would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are
introduced to Invisalign by GPs. Information regarding risks related to our
expectation that orthodontists and GPs will collaborate may be found in Part I,
Item 1A of this Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”


Product Leadership

New
Products and Enhancements to Products.

Our
strategy for ensuring product leadership focuses on delivering new products and
product features as well as enhancing the user experience. In 2005 we launched
Invisalign Express, a lower-cost solution for less complex cases, allowing the
dental professional to treat a broader range of patients. Currently we are in
early testing of a bracket positioning template (or BPT). The BPT product,
which is intended to be used in conjunction with our digital treatment plan,
will, if successfully launched, allow dental professionals to place traditional
brackets on teeth with minimal effort, thereby increasing their efficiency and
reducing patient chair time. New product features and enhancements include the
compliance indicator, Aligner branding and next generation aligner material. The
compliance indicator will help the dental professional and the patient
understand if the patient has worn their Aligner for enough time to effectively
move their teeth. Aligner branding is intended to distinguish and grow the
Invisalign brand, differentiating us from our competitors. Next generation
Aligner material will more consistently deliver force to the teeth over a
longer period of time, improving efficacy of treatment. We believe continuing
to introduce new products and product features as well as enhancing the user
experience will keep us at the forefront of the market.

Extend and defend
technology leadership.

Invisalign represents a
significant technological advancement in orthodontics. Our issued U.S. patents
broadly cover the Invisalign system, including digital modeling and
manipulation of scanned patient data, treatment planning, and fabrication of
dental appliances, among others. We continue to pursue further intellectual
property protection through U.S. and foreign patent applications and non-disclosure
agreements. We also seek to protect our software, documentation and other
written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. Nonetheless, our
intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or
may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of
various countries where the Invisalign system is distributed do not protect our
intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Information
regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology
and our intellectual property rights may be found in Part I, Item 1A of
this Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” See also Part I,
Item 3 of this Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Legal
Proceedings.”

Operational
Effectiveness

Expand and enhance
manufacturing capability.

Our manufacturing
operations are designed to produce large numbers of custom Aligners at a high
level of quality. To improve cost efficiency, we conduct labor intensive
processes in relatively low-wage countries. We believe that our existing
facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or
substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of
operations. Our proprietary software underlies our manufacturing process. By
continually developing this software and other manufacturing processes, we plan
to increase the level of production automation. Increased automation will
enhance production capacity and reduce both production times and unit costs.

Manufacturing

We produce highly customized, precise, medical quality
products in volume. To do so, we have developed a number of proprietary
processes and technologies. These technologies include complex software
solutions, computed tomography, known as CT scanning, stereolithography and
automated Aligner fabrication.

We rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of
the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process. In the event that
either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their
respective products, we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we
qualify and obtain an alternate source.


As of December 31,
2005, we employed a manufacturing staff in the U.S. and Costa Rica of
approximately 573 people. Manufacturing is coordinated in Santa Clara,
California. Digital dental modeling is processed in our 63,000 square foot
facility in San Jose, Costa Rica. The operations team in Costa Rica creates
ClinCheck treatments using simulation software. In the second quarter of 2005,
in an effort to optimize operations, improve efficiency and reduce operating
costs, we announced our intention to relocate our streolithography (SLA) mold
fabrication operations from our Santa Clara, California facility and outsource
this process to a third party shelter services provider based in Juarez, Mexico.
We expect this relocation to be complete by the second quarter of 2006. We also
outsource the fabrication and packaging of Aligners to this same third party
shelter services provider. Information regarding risks associated with our
manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in Part I, Item
1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk
Factors.”

The Invisalign Treatment Process

The Invisalign treatment process comprises the
following five stages:

Orthodontic
diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us.

In
an initial patient visit, the dental professional determines whether Invisalign
is an appropriate treatment. The dental professional then prepares a treatment
data package which consists of a polyvinyl-siloxane, or PVS, impression
of the relevant dental arches, x-rays of the patient’s dentition,
photographs of the patient, a bite impression depicting the relationship
between the patient’s upper and lower dental arches and an Invisalign treatment
planning form, or prescription. The impression is a critical component of
Invisalign as it depicts the three-dimensional geometry of the patient’s
teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models. An impression requires
the patient to bite into a viscous material. This material hardens, capturing
the shape of the patient’s teeth. The prescription is also a critical component
of Invisalign, describing the desired positions and movement of the patient’s
teeth. The dental professional sends the treatment data to our Santa Clara
facility.

Preparation
of three-dimensional computer models of the patient’s initial
malocclusion.

Upon receipt, we use the treatment
data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition. Using CT scanning,
we scan the PVS impression to develop a digital, three-dimensional
computer model of the patient’s current dentition. We then transmit this initial
computer model together with the dental professional’s prescription and
supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in Costa Rica.

Preparation of
computer-simulated treatment and viewing of treatment using ClinCheck

.   In Costa Rica we transform this initial
digital model into a customized, three-dimensional treatment plan that
simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two-week increments. This
simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical, treatment and
quality standards. Upon passing review, the simulation is then made available
to the prescribing dental professional via Virtual Invisalign Practice (VIP),
our proprietary customer interfacing software, which is available on our
websites located at

www.invisalign.com

and

www.aligntech.com

. The dental
professional then reviews the ClinCheck simulation and determines whether to
ask us to make adjustments. By reviewing and amending the treatment simulation,
the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and, thus,
participates in the customized design of the Aligners. At this point, the
dental professional may also invite the patient to review ClinCheck, allowing
the patient to see the projected course of treatment. The dental professional
then approves the proposed treatment and, in doing so, engages us for the
manufacture of corresponding Aligners.

Construction
of molds corresponding to each step of treatment.

We
use the approved ClinCheck simulation to construct a series of molds of the
patient’s teeth. Each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each two-week
stage of the simulated course of treatment. These molds are currently
fabricated at our Santa Clara, California manufacturing facility using
stereolithography that we have adapted for use in orthodontic applications. As
noted above, we intend to relocate our SLA mold fabrication operations from


our Santa Clara,
California facility and outsource this process to a third party shelter
services provider based in Juarez, Mexico. We expect this relocation to be
complete by the second quarter of 2006.

Manufacture of Aligners
and shipment to the dental professional.

From
these molds, our third party shelter services provider in Juarez, Mexico
fabricates Aligners by pressure-forming polymeric sheets over each mold. The
Aligners are then trimmed, polished, cleaned and packaged. Following final
inspection, the Aligners are shipped directly to the prescribing dental
professional. We ship all of the Aligners in a single batch. In certain cases,
dental professionals may use Invisalign in conjunction with tooth-colored
attachments bonded to the patient’s teeth. These attachments are used to
increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the
Aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement. In
certain cases, we provide an aligner-like template to the dental
professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient’s
teeth. Also, in cases where interproximal reduction, or IPR, is requested by
the dental professional, we provide an IPR treatment form, quantifying the
amount of space to be created through enamel reduction, location, and timing of
IPR.

Throughput Management

Because we manufacture each case on a build-to-order
basis, we do not build inventories. As a result, we must conservatively build
manufacturing throughput for anticipated demand. To increase throughput, we
must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing
processes.

In order to increase the
efficiency of our manufacturing processes, we focus our efforts on software
development and the improvement of rate-limiting processes, or
bottlenecks. We continue to upgrade our proprietary, three-dimensional
treatment-planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data
and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case, thereby
increasing the efficiency of our technicians in Costa Rica. We are also
continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and
packaging of Aligners manufactured in Juarez, Mexico. In order to scale our
manufacturing capacity, we expect that we will continue to invest in capital
equipment including the purchase of additional SLA machines during 2006.

Quality Assurance

Align’s quality system is in compliance with Food &
Drug Administration’s Medical Device regulations, 21CFR Part 820, and
Health Canada’s Medical Device Regulations. We are certified to EN ISO
13485:2003, internationally recognized standards for Medical Device
manufacturing and ISO 13485:1996, recognized standards of the Council of
Canada. Align has a formal, documented quality system by which quality
objectives are defined, understood and achieved. Systems, processes and
procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality.
We monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and
direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and
processes, taking corrective action, as needed.

Since we custom manufacture Aligners on a build-to-order
basis, we do not offer refunds on our products. Because each ClinCheck and each
Aligner is unique, we inspect 100% of the product at various points in the
manufacturing process, to ensure that the product meets our customers’
expectations. Aligners are subject to the Invisalign product warranty, which
covers defects in materials and workmanship. Our materials and workmanship
warranty is in force until the Invisalign case is completed. In the event the
Aligners fall within the scope of the Invisalign product warranty, we will
replace the Aligners at our expense. Our warranty is contingent upon proper use
of the Aligners for the purposes for which they are intended. If a patient
chooses not to wear the Aligners, and as a result, requests additional Invisalign
treatment, the dental professional pays the additional expense of the
replacement Aligners.

The Invisalign product
warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment
using Invisalign. Actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the
approved ClinCheck treatment


plan.
Deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of
unpredictable biological factors, such as variations in bone density or tooth
topography and abnormal jaw growth.

Sales and Marketing

We market Invisalign by
communicating Invisalign’s benefits directly to dental professionals through
our training, certification programs and direct mail campaigns and to consumers
with a nationwide advertising campaign. Based on our experience with
advertising and commercial sales in our test markets, we believe that making
consumers aware of Invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates
significant demand for Invisalign. In order to serve anticipated demand, we are
training a broad base of dental professionals.

Professional
Marketing

Our sales and support staff has been engaged in
marketing Invisalign to orthodontists since July 1999. In 2001, we began
marketing Invisalign to general practitioner dentists in our domestic market. We
provide training, certification, marketing and clinical support to
orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in the U.S. and Canada, which
we consider our domestic market, and internationally.

As of December 31, 2005, we had trained
approximately 35,800 dental professionals worldwide to use Invisalign. Of those
trained dental professionals, approximately 73% are dental professionals in our
domestic market (United States and Canada). Within our domestic market, we have
trained approximately 7,900 orthodontists and approximately 18,200 active
general practitioner dentists.

Invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles
that apply to traditional treatment. Our sales and orthodontic teams conduct
training primarily in a workshop format. The key topics covered in training
include Invisalign applicability, instructions on filling out the Invisalign
treatment form, clinical tips and techniques, guidance on pricing and
instructions on interacting with our ClinCheck software and the many other
features of our website.

After training, sales
representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their
staff is prepared to handle Invisalign cases. Such follow up may include
assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions, establishing an
Internet connection and familiarizing them with our website. Sales
representatives may also provide practice-building assistance, including
helping the dental professional to market Invisalign to prospective patients
through direct mail or other forms of media. Many dental professionals have
commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance.

Consumer Marketing

Our experience indicates
that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources:

·

an
orthodontist;

·

a
general practice dentist;

·

consumer
marketing and advertising;

·

our
website, which can be accessed at either www.invisalign.com or
www.aligntech.com.

·

direct-to-consumer
mail advertising and public relations efforts; and

·

other
Invisalign patients.


In the second quarter of
2005, we launched a new consumer marketing campaign and advertising strategy
involving television, radio, print media and consumer website. This marketing
program is designed to raise the profile of Invisalign and drive more consumers
to our most experienced dental professionals.

Research and Development

Our research and development effort is focused on
extending the range of dental applicability of Invisalign, enhancing the
software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our Invisalign system
product lines. Our research and development expenses were $18.6 million for
fiscal 2005, $15.8 million for fiscal 2004 and $13.1 million for
fiscal 2003.

In an effort to
demonstrate Invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities, a series of clinical
case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability
of Invisalign to malocclusion cases, including those of severe complexity. We
are also undertaking post-marketing studies and making additional
technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process. Our
product development team is testing enhanced materials and a number of
complementary products, such as the bracket positioning template that when used
in conjunction with our digital treatment plan, will, if successfully launched,
guide doctors in proper bracket placement in traditional wires and brackets
therapy and the compliance indicator, which will help doctors and patients
understand if the patients have worn their Aligners for enough time to effectively
move their teeth.

Intellectual Property

We believe our intellectual property position
represents a substantial business advantage. As of December 31, 2005, we
had 62 issued U.S. patents, 97 pending U.S. patent applications, and numerous
foreign issued patents, as well as pending foreign patent applications.

See Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings for a discussion on
Reexamination Proceedings pending with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office.

We continue to pursue
further intellectual property protection through U.S. and foreign patent
applications and non-disclosure agreements. We also seek to protect our
software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and
copyright laws. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of
any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may
be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and
sufficient to protect our technology or products. Our intellectual property
rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated,
circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries
where Invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights
to the same extent as U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary
information could harm our business.

Information regarding
risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our
intellectual property rights may be found in Part I, Item 1A of this
Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”

Competition

We compete for the attention of dental professionals
with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances (or wires and
brackets), which include 3M Company, Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply
International, Inc. We also compete directly with established companies
that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to Invisalign,
including the product called Red, White & Blue manufactured and
distributed by Ormco Orthodontics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sybron Dental
Specialties. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for a summary of our
litigation with Ormco and the permanent injunction issued by the Court to
enjoin Ormco from selling the infringing Red, White & Blue. In May 2005,
OrthoClear, Inc. announced the commercial launch of the OrthoClear system,
a product that is intended to compete directly with our Invisalign system. We
believe that OrthoClear’s product infringes on our intellectual property,
including our trade secrets.

See Part I, Item 3 “Legal
Proceedings” for a


summary
of our litigation with OrthoClear.

In the future, we may face
further competition from other early stage and more mature companies who enter
our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in
use to Invisalign. Information regarding risks associated with increased
competition may be found in Part I, Item IA of this Report on Form 10-K
under the heading “Risk Factors.”

We believe that in
addition to price, the principal competitive factors in the market for
orthodontic appliances include the following:

·

aesthetic
appeal of the treatment method;

·

effectiveness
of treatment;

·

customer
support;

·

comfort
associated with the treatment method;

·

oral
hygiene;

·

ease
of use; and

·

dental
professionals’ chair time.

We believe that Invisalign
compares favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these
factors.

Government Regulation

FDA’s
Quality System Regulation for Medical Devices.

Invisalign
has recently been informed by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA that our
Invisalign system has been classified as a Class II medical device,
correcting what the FDA described as a prior classification error. The
Invisalign system was previously regulated as a Class I medical device and
was exempted from requiring 510(k) pre-market notification prior to
commercialization. In 1998, however, we voluntarily filed with and subsequently
received pre-market clearance from the FDA pursuant to the 510(k) premarket
notification procedure, allowing us to market the product in the U.S. Therefore,
we currently possess the necessary 510(k) clearance from the FDA to
continue to market our product under the Class II classification. Prior to
this classification correction, our product development, manufacturing
processes, packaging, labeling, handling, storage and distribution activities
were subject to extensive oversight by the FDA. We believe our Invisalign
system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system
regulations, record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and
distribution of the Invisalign system. We do not anticipate any significant
difficulty or material cost increases in complying with applicable performance
standards as a result of the incremental regulatory requirements resulting from
the Class II classification.

Our Aligners are manufactured by International Manufacturing Solutions
Operaciones, S.R.L. (“IMS”), a third party shelter services provider based in

Juarez,

Mexico.
IMS is registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and is
certified to ISO 9001:2000 requirements. We have also ensured that our quality
system procedures and processes have been implemented at IMS to comply with the
FDA’s Quality Systems standards. IMS has dedicated an area in its facilities
and trained personnel in the manufacture and distribution of Invisalign. We and
IMS are subject to routine inspections by the FDA and state agencies to
determine compliance with Quality System requirements. We are registered with
the State of California as a medical device manufacturer.

If the FDA determines that we or IMS failed to comply with the applicable
FDA regulations, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against
us, ranging from a public Warning Letter to more severe sanctions, including
but not limited to financial penalties, withdrawal of our right to market our
products and criminal prosecution.


Health
Canada’s Medical Device Regulations.

In Canada, we
are required to comply with Health Canada’s

Medical Device
Regulations. Our products are registered with Health Canada. We believe we are
in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market
our products in Canada.

European
Union’s MDD Requirements & ISO 13485.

In
Europe, Invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such, we follow the
requirements of the Medical Device Directives. We are ISO 13485 certified,
which facilitates commercialization of Invisalign outside the United States and
especially in Europe.

Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

Under
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA,
Congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to
establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain
health information. Confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances
under which these records may be released are subject to substantial
regulations under the HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable
Health Information, referred to as the Privacy Standard, and other state laws
and regulations. The Privacy Standard governs both the disclosure and the use
of confidential patient medical information. Although compliance is principally
the responsibility of the hospital, physician or other healthcare provider, we
are required to maintain the confidentiality of patient information when
providing technical services and when handling patient information and records.
We have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the
requirements of the Privacy and Security standards under HIPAA and applicable
corresponding state laws and regulations. Maintaining systems that are
consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex
changes in the way we do business or provided services to our customers. Additionally,
our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in
dealing with HIPAA requirements.

Other
Federal and State Laws.

As a participant in the
health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing
regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the
federal, state and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be,
applicable to our business. Furthermore, our health care service provider
customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could
affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us.

Laws regulating medical
device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects.
For example, the confidentiality of patient medical information and the
circumstances under which such information may be used by us, released for
inclusion in our databases, or released by us to third parties, are subject to
substantial regulation by state governments. These state laws and regulations
govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical
information and are evolving rapidly. In addition, provisions under the federal
anti-kickback statute prohibit, among other things, paying or offering to pay
any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person
participating in, or for the order, purchase or recommendation of items or
services that are subject to reimbursement by, Medicare, Medicaid and other
similar federal or state health care programs. Most states have also enacted
illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws. These laws are
applicable to our financial relationships with, and any marketing or other
promotional activities involving, our dental professional customers. Finally,
various states regulate the operation of an advertising and referral service
for dentists, and may require registration of such services with a state agency
as well as compliance with various requirements and restrictions on how they
conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists.
Violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of
civil and criminal sanctions.

ITEM
1A.   RISK FACTORS

If we
fail to sustain our revenue growth while controlling our expenses, the market
price of our common stock may decline.

You should consider our business and prospects in
light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by a company in an
early stage of operations. Consistent with a company in an early stage of
operations, we continue to incur significant operating expenses to:

·

develop
new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing processes;

·

execute
our consumer marketing campaign and dental professional marketing efforts;

·

execute
clinical research and education plans;

·

develop
technological improvements to our products and new product development;

·

continue
our international sales and marketing efforts;

·

protect
our intellectual property, including trade secrets; and

·

undertake
quality assurance and improvement initiatives.

For instance, in an
effort to raise the profile of Invisalign and drive prospective patients
to our most experienced dental professionals, in the second quarter of 2005, we
launched a consumer marketing campaign involving television, radio and print
media.  Marketing programs of this nature
are expensive and may have limited success, if any, and may not result in
revenue generation commensurate with its costs.

While we achieved
profitability beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we experienced a
net loss in the third quarter of 2005. If we are to achieve profitability in
future periods, we will need to continue to increase our revenues, while
controlling our expenses. We generated positive operating cash flow for the
first time in fiscal year 2003 and continued to generate positive operating
cash flow in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. However, we cannot be certain that we
will be able to sustain or increase such positive cash flow from operations,
from period to period, in the future. Because our business is evolving, it is
difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth, and we
may not be able to sustain our historical growth rates in future periods. If we
do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the
expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our
common stock will likely decline.

We have a limited operating history and expect our
future financial results to fluctuate which may cause volatility in our stock
price.

We were incorporated in April 1997 and began
sales of Invisalign in July 1999. Thus, we have a limited operating
history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. In
addition, we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to
fluctuate as we focus on increasing our commercial sales. These fluctuations
could cause our stock price to decline. Some of the factors that could cause
our operating results to fluctuate include:

·

the
development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors,
such as OrthoClear, Inc.;

·

aggressive
price competition from competitors, including OrthoClear;

·

changes
in the timing of product orders;


·

unanticipated
delays in production caused by insufficient capacity, any disruptions in the
manufacturing process, including as a result of unexpected turnover in the
labor force or the introduction of new production processes;

·

inaccurate
forecasting of revenues, production and other operating costs;

·

costs
and expenditures in connection with ongoing litigation, in particular the
litigation related to OrthoClear;

·

changes
in product mix due to the introduction of Invisalign Express, a lower-cost
alternative for treating less complex cases; and

·

investments
in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to
Invisalign.

To respond to these and
other factors, we may need to make business decisions that could adversely
affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy,
business structure or operations. Most of our expenses, such as employee
compensation and lease payment obligations, are relatively fixed in the short term.
Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding
future revenue levels. As a result, if our revenues for a particular period
fall below our expectations, we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough
to offset any shortfall in revenues. Therefore, our operating results for a
given period may be adversely affected. Due to these and other factors, we
believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be
meaningful. You should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an
indication of our future performance.

We
are currently involved in litigation with several former employees stemming
from our efforts to protect our intellectual property. This litigation is
costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of
operations and stock price.

We seek to diligently protect our intellectual
property rights. On February 2, 2005 we filed a complaint against
OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear Holdings, Inc., Mr. Chishti, one of
our founders, and several former employees. Among other things, the complaint
alleges tort, contract, statutory and common law causes of action arising from
OrthoClear and the individual defendants’ alleged plan to unlawfully utilize
our intellectual property, confidential information and employees. The
complaint also alleges that OrthoClear, Mr. Chishti, and other defendants
are in breach of contractual obligations, statutory law and common law for
attempting to intentionally interfere and disrupt our ongoing business
operations and improperly gain access to our customer relationships and trade
secrets. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages in an
amount to be determined. On July 19, 2005, we filed a multi-claim lawsuit
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against OrthoClear. The complaint alleges numerous violations
of the federal Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. §1051 et seq.) by OrthoClear and its
officers and employees. These violations include unfair competition, trademark
infringement and false advertising. The complaint also alleges violations by
OrthoClear of California’s Unfair Practices Act (California Business and
Professions Code §17200 et seq.). On January 11, 2006, we filed a
complaint with the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) against OrthoClear,
seeking to halt the importation into the United States of infringing aligners
manufactured by OrthoClear in Pakistan in violation of our patents and other
intellectual property rights. The ITC Complaint requests the ITC institute an
immediate investigation and ultimately issue an exclusionary order, enforced by
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, excluding OrthoClear aligners from
importation into the United States. The ITC Complaint also requests the ITC
issue two cease and desist orders specifically preventing OrthoClear from
importing infringing aligners and from selling in the United States imported
OrthoClear aligners. The ITC has determined to institute a formal
investigation. In addition, on January 11, 2006, we filed a federal court
patent infringement action in the Western District of Wisconsin (Madison). This
federal action seeks monetary damages and an injunction to augment the
exclusionary relief available from the ITC.


Although each of
these lawsuits is in the early stages, litigating claims of this type, whether
or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us, is costly and
diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel
from normal business operations. Any of these results from our litigation could
adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.

In addition, we are
currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims. Management
does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal proceedings and
claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results
of operations. However, in the Ormco litigation, there is no assurance that the
court’s decision will not be overturned on appeal. In addition, litigation is
subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur. An
unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases where injunctive
relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products. Any
of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of
operations and stock price.

See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K
for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings.

We experience competition from manufacturers of
traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other
companies that may introduce new technologies in the future.

Currently, our Invisalign
product competes directly against a product called Red, White and Blue, which
is manufactured and distributed by Ormco, a subsidiary of Sybron Dental
Specialties, and an aligner product manufactured by OrthoClear, Inc. In
addition, manufacturers of traditional braces, such as 3M Company, Sybron
Dental Specialties and Dentsply International have substantially greater
financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and
may, in the future, attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours.
Large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market.
Furthermore, we may face competition in the future from new companies that may
introduce new technologies. We may be unable to compete with these competitors
and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or
economically unattractive. If we are unable to compete effectively with
existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or
existing competitors, our business could be harmed. In May 2005,
OrthoClear announced the launch of the OrthoClear system, a product that is
intended to compete directly with our Invisalign system. Although we intend to
vigorously defend our intellectual property rights and prevent OrthoClear from
continuing to market any product that infringes on our intellectual property,
if OrthoClear is successful in gaining broad market acceptance of its product,
our business could be adversely affected.

See Part I Item 3 of
this Report on Form 10-K for a more complete summary of the
OrthoClear litigation.

Increased competition from OrthoClear and
other competitors has recently resulted in and may in the future result in
volume discounting and price reductions, reduced gross margins, reduced
profitability and loss of market share, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our revenue, volume growth, net profit and stock price. For
instance, in the fourth quarter of 2005, in order to encourage continued use of
our products, we extended our volume based discount program directed to all of
our doctors. In addition, in the second half of 2005, we introduced Invisalign
Express, a lower-cost solution for less complex cases as well as a new pricing
initiative which had the effect of reducing our average selling price per case.
These programs have adversely affected our revenues, gross margin and net
profit. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully
against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will
not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Our information technology systems are critical to our
business. System integration and implementation issues and system security
risks could disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact
on our business and operating results.

We rely on the
efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology
systems. All information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from a variety of sources. As our


business has grown in size and complexity, the growth
has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our information
technology systems. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to
continually upgrade and enhance our information systems to more effectively
manage our operations.

Throughout 2006 we
intend to add additional functionality into our business enterprise systems,
which will more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system
applications, such as customer facing and manufacturing tools. System upgrades
and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable
employee resources. Delays in integration or disruptions to our business from
implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse
impact on our financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, we continuously
upgrade our customer facing software applications, specifically ClinCheck and
VIP. Software applications frequently contain errors or defects, especially
when they are first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition,
we currently do not have adequate resiliency in our information technology
systems. The discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the
failure of our primary information systems may result in the following
consequences, among others: loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance,
damage to our reputation or increased service costs, any of which could have a
material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of
operations. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2005 we began transitioning to a
new information technology outsourcing provider. We terminated this
relationship in the first quarter of 2006 and are currently transitioning back
to our original information technology outsourcing provider. Delays in
transition and failure to migrate smoothly through this transition could cause
business disruptions.

In addition, experienced
computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security
and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, create
system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Furthermore, sophisticated hardware and
operating system software and applications that we either internally produce or
procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture,
including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the
operation of the system. The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems,
viruses and bugs could be significant, and the efforts to address these
problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact
on our operations, sales and operating results.

While we believe we currently have adequate internal
control over financial reporting, we are required to assess our internal
control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse
results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in
our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.

Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC, we are required to furnish in our Form 10-K
an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether
or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This
assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting identified by management. While we currently
believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, the
effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk
that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, and,
as a result, the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial
reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we are unable to
assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any
future period (or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the
effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls
are ineffective), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and
completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on
our stock price.


We depend on the sale of Invisalign for the vast
majority of our revenues, and any decline in sales of Invisalign or average
selling prices would adversely affect revenue, gross margin and net profits.

We expect that revenues
from the sale of Invisalign will continue to account for the vast majority of
our total revenues for the foreseeable future. Continued and widespread market
acceptance of Invisalign by orthodontists, GPs and consumers is critical to our
future success. If orthodontists and GPs experience a reduction in consumer
demand for orthodontic services, if consumers prove unwilling to adopt
Invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we
anticipate,  if orthodontists and GPs do
not collaborate as we expect or if the average selling price of our product
declines, our operating results would be harmed. Factors that could cause
Invisalign not to achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect, as
well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more
fully below.

Dental
professionals may not adopt Invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as
we anticipate.

Our success depends upon
increasing acceptance of Invisalign by dental professionals. Invisalign
requires orthodontists, GPs and their staff to undergo special training and
learn to interact with patients in new ways. In addition, because Invisalign
has only been in clinical testing since July 1997 and commercially
available only since July 1999, orthodontists and GPs may be reluctant to
adopt it until more historical clinical results are available. Also, increasing
adoption and cumulative use by orthodontists and GPs will depend on factors
such as the capability, safety, efficacy, ease of use, price, quality and
reliability of our products, our ability to provide effective sales support,
training and service and the availability of competing products, technologies
and alternative treatments. In the future, unanticipated poor clinical
performance of Invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and,
consequently, reduced acceptance by dental professionals. In addition,
increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share
and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their
Invisalign practice. If Invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the
orthodontic and GP communities, our operating results will be harmed.

Consumers may not
adopt Invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate.

In addition, our success depends upon the acceptance
of Invisalign by a substantially larger number of dental professionals as well
as potential consumers to whom we are now actively marketing. Invisalign
represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment, and
consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to
conventional treatment. In addition, consumers may not comply with recommended
treatment guidelines for Invisalign, which could compromise the effectiveness
of their treatment. We have generally received positive feedback from both
orthodontists, GPs and consumers regarding Invisalign as both an alternative to
braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion, but a number of
dental professionals believe that Invisalign is appropriate for only a limited
percentage of their patients. Market acceptance will depend in part upon the
recommendations of dental professionals, as well as other factors including
effectiveness, safety, reliability, improved treatment, aesthetics, greater
comfort and hygiene compared to conventional orthodontic products and price for
Invisalign compared to competing products. Furthermore, consumers may not
respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching
our target audience. Adoption by consumers may also be affected by general
macroeconomic conditions in North America and internationally, which fluctuate
and could be affected by unstable global economic, political or other
conditions.

The orthodontist
and GPs may choose not to collaborate and referrals between orthodontists and
GPs may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all.

Our success depends in
part upon improving the collaboration and referral relationships between
orthodontists and GP dentists. As specialists, orthodontists are a critical
part of our business, and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat
the majority of complex cases and continue to drive


research
for expanding Invisalign applications. We expect, however, that the percentage
of revenues generated by GPs will increase, largely due to the fact that there
are significantly more GPs than orthodontists. As the primary provider of
dental care, GPs have access to a greater number of patients than
orthodontists, possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and
introduce them to Invisalign, have the ability to refer appropriate cases to
orthodontist and, in certain instances, may chose to treat less complex cases
themselves. If this collaboration and increase in referrals does not occur or
occurs more slowly than we anticipate, our operating results could be harmed.

Declines in average
selling prices of our products.

In response to challenges
in our business, including increased competition, in the second half of 2005,
we reduced the list price of full Invisalign cases and introduced Invisalign
Express, a lower-cost solution for less complex cases. In addition, in the
fourth quarter of 2005, we expanded our volume based discount program to all
doctors. As a result of these programs, the blended average selling price for
our products has declined. We expect each of these programs, and other similar
programs that we may introduce in the future, to adversely affect our revenue,
gross margin and net profits.

Our future success
may depend on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products.

Our future success may
depend on our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval or clearance of,
manufacture and market new products. In the second half of 2005, we launched
Invisalign Express a low-cost Aligner system to be used for less complex cases.
We are in early testing of a bracket positioning template and other new
products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully
develop, sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and
applications and enhanced versions of our existing product. The extent of, and
rate at which, market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future
products is a function of many variables, which include, among other things,
price, safety, efficacy, reliability, marketing and sales efforts, the
availability of third-party reimbursement of procedures using our new products,
the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting
purchasing patterns. Our ability to market and sell new products may also be
subject to government regulation, including approval or clearance by the United
States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and foreign government agencies.
Any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products
or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new
products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results and could cause our revenues to decline.

We are dependent on
our international manufacturing operations, which exposes us to foreign
operational, political and other risks that may harm our business.

Currently, two of our key production steps are
performed in operations located outside of the U.S. At our facility in Costa
Rica, technicians use a sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling
program to prepare electronic treatment plans, which are transmitted electronically
back to the U.S. These electronic files form the basis of ClinCheck and are
used to manufacture Aligner molds. A third
party shelter services provider
in Juarez, Mexico fabricates Aligners and ships the completed products to our
customers. We are currently in the process of relocating our SLA mold
fabrication operations from our Santa Clara, California facility to this same
third party provider. We expect this relocation to be complete by the second
quarter of 2006. As a result of this relocation, our reliance on our
international manufacturing operations will continue to increase. Our costs
associated with these operations are denominated in Costa Rican colons, Mexican
pesos and U.S. dollars. Our increasing reliance on


international
operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business
or results of operation, including:

·

difficulties
in hiring and retaining employees generally, as well as difficulties in hiring
and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical
aspects of our operations;

·

difficulties
in managing international operations, including our relationship with IMS, our
third party shelter services provider;

·

import
and export license requirements and restrictions;

·

controlling
production volume and quality of the manufacturing process;

·

political,
social and economic instability;

·

acts
of terrorism and acts of war;

·

interruptions
and limitations in telecommunication services;

·

product
or material transportation delays or disruption;

·

burdens
of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws;

·

trade
restrictions and changes in tariffs;

·

fluctuations
in currency exchange rates; and

·

potential
adverse tax consequences.

If any of these risks materialize in the future, we
could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue. In addition to
the risks set forth above, if we do not successfully coordinate the relocation
and consolidation of our SLA mold fabrication operations, we may be unable to
produce sufficient volume of molds to meet customer demand, which would harm
our results of operations.

Our
success depends in part on our proprietary technology, and if we are unable to
successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position
may be harmed.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to
maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further
intellectual property protection for our products, both in the U.S. and in
other countries. Our inability to do so could harm our competitive position. As
of December 31, 2005, we had 62 issued U.S. patents, 97 pending U.S.
patent applications, and numerous foreign issued patents, as well as pending
foreign patent applications.


We intend to rely on our
portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in other
countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our
competitive position. However, our currently pending or future patent filings
may not result in the issuance of patents. Additionally, any patents issued to
us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, circumvented, or may not
be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing
products similar in design to our products. During fiscal 2005, requests were
filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) by a San
Francisco, California, law firm, acting on behalf of an unnamed party,
requesting re-examination of a number of our patents. The USPTO has
granted the request to reexamine U.S. Patent Nos. 5,975,893, 6,398,548,
6,309,215, 6,705,863, 6,217,325. As of the date of this Report on Form 10-K,
the USPTO issued initial Office Actions with regard to U.S. Patent Nos.
6,217,325 (the ‘325 patent), 6,309,215 (the ‘215 patent) and 5,975,893 (the ‘893
patent). While the pending re-examinations are in a preliminary stage and we
are still evaluating all issues, we believe that the claims of the patents in
re-examination will be determined to be patentable as currently written or as
may be amended during the re-examination proceedings. However, there can be no
assurance that we will prevail, and the re-examination proceedings could cause
some or all of these patent claims to have a narrower scope of coverage or even
to be invalidated, which would have an adverse affect on us.

See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K for a summary of
the USPTO proceedings.

In addition, any protection afforded by
foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under U.S. patents and
intellectual property laws. We also rely on protection of our copyrights, trade
secrets, know-how and proprietary information. We generally enter into
confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and our
collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us. However,
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized
use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information, and
adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to
occur.

See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K
for a summary of the OrthoClear litigation.

Our inability to maintain
the proprietary nature of our technology through patents, copyrights or trade
secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth
prospects. In particular, a failure of our proprietary rights might allow
competitors to copy our technology, which could adversely affect our pricing
and market share.

If we
lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we
may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products.

We are highly dependent on
the key employees in our clinical engineering, technology development, sales
and marketing personnel and management teams. The loss of the services of those
individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product
development and other business objectives and could harm our business. Our
future success will also depend on our ability to identify, recruit, train and
retain additional qualified personnel, including orthodontists. Few
orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since
they are generally trained to work in private practices, universities and other
research institutions. Thus, we may be unable to attract and retain personnel
with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our
business. Furthermore, we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel
or their services. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our
business could be materially harmed.

If we
infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a
patent infringement claim, our ability to grow our business will be severely
limited.

Extensive litigation over patents and other
intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry. We have
been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be
the subject of patent or other litigation in the future. From time to time, we
have received and may in the


future receive letters
from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. While we do
not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have
been brought to our attention, there may be other more pertinent rights of
which we are presently unaware. The defense and prosecution of intellectual
property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative
proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion
of effort by our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination
of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party
could subject us to significant liabilities. An adverse determination of this
nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted
narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties. Licenses may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in which event, our
business would be materially adversely affected.

See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K
for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings.

We
currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing
process, and if our access to these inputs is diminished, our business may be
harmed.

We currently outsource key
portions of our manufacturing process. We rely on a third party shelter
services provider located in Juarez, Mexico to fabricate Aligners and to ship
the completed product to customers. In addition, by the second quarter of
fiscal 2006, we expect to complete the relocation of our SLA mold fabrication
process to the same third party shelter services provider in Juarez, Mexico. As
a result, if this third party fails to deliver its components or if we lose its
services, we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner, and our
business may be harmed. Any difficulties encountered by the third party shelter services provider
with respect to hiring and retaining qualified personnel, and maintaining
acceptable manufacturing standards, controls, procedures and policies could
disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner. Finding a
substitute manufacturer may be expensive, time-consuming or impossible.

We
maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and
materials technologies, and our business and operating results could be harmed
if supply is restricted or ends.

We are highly dependent on
manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment, rapid prototyping machines,
resin and other advanced materials. We maintain single supply relationships for
many of these machines and materials technologies. In particular, we are
committed to purchase all of our resin from a single-source and our scanning
and stereolithography equipment are provided by single suppliers. Technology
changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity
or require expensive, time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate
new equipment or processes. Our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more
of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in
sufficient quantities to support our growth. In the event of technology
changes, delivery delays or shortages of these items, our business and growth
prospects may be harmed.

We
have experienced rapid growth, and our failure to manage this growth could harm
our business.

We have expanded rapidly
since we commenced commercial sales in 1999. Our headcount increased from
approximately 50 employees as of December 31, 1999 to approximately 1,097
employees as of December 31, 2005. This expansion will continue to place
significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to
continue to develop and improve our operational, financial and other internal
controls, both in the U.S. and internationally. In particular, rapid growth
increases the challenges involved in a number of areas, including recruiting
and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel, providing adequate training and
supervision to maintain our high quality standards, and preserving our culture
and values. Our inability to effectively manage this level of growth could harm
our business.


We
rely on our direct sales force to sell our products, and any failure to
maintain our direct sales force could harm our business

.

Our ability to sell our
products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our
domestic market and internationally. As of December 31, 2005 our sales
organization consisted of 130 people of which 106 were direct sales
representatives and 24 were sales administration and management. We do not have
any long-term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force.
The loss of the services of these key personnel may harm our business. In the
first half of 2005, approximately 17 orthodontic sales representatives,
representing approximately 50% of our orthodontic sales force, left Align and
joined OrthoClear. Although we have replaced the majority of these individuals
with new sales representatives, to adequately train and successfully deploy new
representatives into effected regions and to reestablish strong customer
relationships takes time. If we are unable to replace our direct sales force
personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and
qualifications, or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical
expertise or if we fail to reestablish strong relationships with our customers
within a relatively short period of time, our revenues and our ability to
maintain market share could be materially harmed.

Complying
with regulations enforced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other
regulatory authorities is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any
failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.

Our products are medical devices and are subject to
extensive regulation in the U.S. and internationally. FDA regulations are wide
ranging and govern, among other things:

·

product
design, development, manufacture and testing;

·

product
labeling;

·

product
storage;

·

pre-market
clearance or approval;

·

advertising
and promotion; and

·

product
sales and distribution.

Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory
requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies,
which may include any of the following sanctions:

·

warning
letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;

·

repair,
replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;

·

operating
restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;

·

refusing
our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products,
new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;

·

withdrawing
clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and

·

criminal
prosecution.

If any of these
events were to occur, they could harm our business. We must comply with
facility registration and product listing requirements of the FDA and adhere to
applicable Quality System regulations. The FDA enforces its Quality System
regulations through periodic unannounced inspections. We and our third party
shelter services provider have not yet been subject to an FDA inspection, and
we cannot assure you we or our third party shelter services provider will
successfully pass such an inspection in the future. Our failure or the failure
of our third party shelter services provider to take satisfactory


corrective action in response to an adverse inspection
or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result
in enforcement action, and we may be required to find alternative
manufacturers, which could be a long and costly process.

Before we can sell a new
medical device in the U.S., or market a new use of or claim for an existing
product we must obtain FDA clearance or approval, unless an exemption applies.
Obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and
time-consuming process. Even though the devices we market have obtained the
necessary clearances from the FDA, we may be unable to maintain such clearances
in the future. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances
for new devices that we intend to market in the future. Our inability to
maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our
business.

If
the security of our customer and patient information is compromised, patient
care could suffer, and we could be liable for related damages, and our
reputation could be impaired.

We retain confidential
customer and patient information in our processing centers. Therefore, it is
critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our
facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our
customers to be secure. Despite the implementation of security measures, our
infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses,
programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. If
we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare
information, we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be
impaired. In addition, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable if our
systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner. Our insurance
may not protect us from this risk.

If
compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our
customers or for us, we may not be able to grow our business.

Participants in the
healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations
under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal, state
and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be, applicable to
our business. Furthermore, our healthcare provider customers are also subject
to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and
scope of their relationships with us.

The healthcare market
itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and
regulatory influences. Regulations implemented pursuant to the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), including regulations affecting the
security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare
providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and
unplanned enhancements of software applications or services, result in delays
or cancellations of orders, or result in the revocation of endorsement of our
products and services by healthcare participants. The effect of HIPAA and newly
enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict, and there can be
no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by
HIPAA and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any
resulting business opportunities.

Extensive
and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive
to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties.

In addition to medical device laws and regulations,
numerous state and federal healthcare-related laws regulate our business,
covering areas such as:

·

storage,
transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records;


·

prohibitions
against the offer, payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to
entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order,
purchase or recommendation of our products; and

·

the
marketing and advertising of our products.

Complying with these laws
and regulations could be expensive and time-consuming, and could increase our
operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing
activities or our revenues.

We
face risks related to our international sales, including the need to obtain
necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals.

We currently sell our
products in Europe, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Brazil, Australia and
Hong Kong, and may expand into other countries from time to time. Recently, we
announced our intention to launch sales of Invisalign in Japan. We do not know
whether orthodontists, GPs and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt
Invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate. In addition,
sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory
requirements that vary widely from country to country. The time required to
obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than
that required for FDA clearance or approval, and requirements for such
approvals may differ from FDA requirements. We may be unable to obtain
regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do
business or in which we may do business in the future. We may also incur
significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory
approvals. If we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our
products outside of the U.S., or if we fail to receive these approvals, we may
be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a
timely manner, if at all.

Our
business exposes us to potential product liability claims, and we may incur
substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or
litigation.

Medical devices involve an
inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. We
may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or
incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found
unsuitable. Although we intend to continue to maintain product liability
insurance, adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms, if at
all, and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. A
product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could
result in significant legal defense costs. These costs would have the effect of
increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the
operation of our business, and could harm our business.

In
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, the market price for our common stock was
volatile.

The market price of our common stock could be subject
to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are
beyond our control. The factors include:

·

quarterly
variations in our results of operations and liquidity;

·

changes
in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our
revenues or operating results;

·

speculation
in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of
operations;

·

strategic
actions by our competitors, such as product announcements or acquisitions;


·

announcements
of technological innovations or new products by us, our customers or
competitors; and

·

general
market conditions.

In addition, the stock
market in general, and the market for technology and medical device companies
in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of
those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the
market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In
the past, class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing
company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s
securities. If a securities class action suit is filed against us in the
future, we would incur substantial legal fees, and our management’s attention
and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond
to the litigation.

Future
sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price.

A large percentage of our
outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant
stockholders. These stockholders have sold in the past, and may sell in the
future, large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time.
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our
existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common
stock. Such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems
with our business and may depress our stock price.

Changes
in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations, such as
expensing of stock options, could result in unfavorable accounting charges.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and
various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies.
A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported
results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Our
accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in
the accounting rules are as follows:

·

revenue
recognition;

·

accounting
for share-based payments; and

·

accounting
for income taxes.

In particular, the FASB
recently enacted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS
123R”) which we will adopt effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. As a
result, we expect that SFAS 123R will have a significant adverse effect on our
reported financial results and may impact the way in which we conduct our
business, which may affect our stock price.


We have made use of a shareholders rights’ plan to
limit the possibility that we are acquired, which may mean that a transaction
that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented.

Our board of directors has
the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to
determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such shares
without any further vote or action by our shareholders. To date, our board of
directors has designated 200,000 shares as Series A participating
preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan. The issuance
of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of
delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company or otherwise adversely
affecting the rights of the holders of our stock. The shareholder rights’ plan
may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition
of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors. The
shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group
attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of
directors, except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation, purchase or
redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan.

PROPERTIES

Our headquarters are located in Santa Clara,
California. We lease approximately 127,000 square feet of space where we house
our manufacturing, customer support, software engineering and administrative
personnel. We lease our Santa Clara facilities under four leases, which expire
in June 2010. The combined monthly rent for the Santa Clara facilities is
approximately $70,000. Commencing July 1, 2005 and continuing on the first
day of each calendar month thereafter, $10,575 will be deducted from the
$1,269,000 security deposit previously paid by us to the lessor and such amount
will be applied against the monthly base rent for the Santa Clara facilities.

We operate a facility in San Jose, Costa Rica. The
facility comprises approximately 63,000 square feet of manufacturing and office
space. The monthly rent for the Costa Rica facility is approximately $56,000. The
lease for this facility expires at the end of 2008.

Our European headquarters are located in Amsterdam,
The Netherlands. The facility comprises approximately 11,000 square feet of
office space. The monthly rent for the Amsterdam facility is approximately
$17,000. The lease for this facility expires in 2014 with an option to
terminate with a fee of approximately $220,000 during 2009. We expect this
lease will not be renewed beyond 2009.

We operate a facility in Moscow, Russia. The facility
comprises approximately 6,000 square feet of office space where we conduct
certain research and development activities. The monthly rent for the Russian
facility is approximately $17,000. The lease for this facility expires in March 2006
and we currently expect that this lease will be renewed.

We believe that our
existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that
additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any
expansion of operations.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.

OrthoClear

State
Action.

On February 2,
2005, we filed a multi-claim lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior Court
against defendants OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear Holdings, Inc.,
Muhammad Ziaullah Chishti, Bao Tran, Peter Riepenhausen, Joe Breeland, Jeff
Tunnell, Christopher Kawaja, and Charles Wen (the “State Action”). Among other
things, the State Action alleges tort, contract, statutory and common law
causes of


action arising from
OrthoClear and the individual defendants’ alleged plan to unlawfully utilize
our intellectual property, confidential information and employees. The State
Action also alleges that OrthoClear, Chishti and other defendants are in breach
of contractual obligations, statutory law and common law for attempting to
intentionally interfere and disrupt our ongoing business operations and
improperly gain access to our customer relationships and trade secrets. The
State Action seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages in an amount to be
determined.

On February 15, 2005, OrthoClear, Chishti,
Riepenhausen, Breeland, Tunnell, Kawaja and Wen filed a multi-claim
cross-complaint against Align, Thomas Prescott, Roger George, Eldon Bullington,
David Thrower, Patricia Wadors, Gil Laks and Kelsey Wirth (collectively, the “Align
Parties”) alleging conspiracy, breach of contract, libel, slander, unjust
enrichment, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and
unfair competition. The cross-complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary
damages in an amount to be determined.

On February 18, 2005, the Court granted our
request for and issued a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) prohibiting
OrthoClear and the individual OrthoClear defendants from engaging, assisting,
or participating, directly or indirectly, in soliciting, inducing to leave,
recruiting, or encouraging any current Align employee or consultant to
terminate or alter his or her employment or business relationship with Align or
attempting to do the same. The Court also granted our request and issued a TRO
prohibiting OrthoClear and the individual OrthoClear defendants from
disclosing, using, lecturing upon or publishing any of our proprietary
information without our express prior written permission. In addition, in
response to a cross-application for TRO filed by certain OrthoClear defendants,
the Court enjoined Chishti and the Align Parties from disparaging each other in
such a manner as to violate the mutual non-disparagement clause contained in
the Separation Agreement between Align and Chishti dated as of March 27,
2002. The Court also enjoined the Align Parties from advising any Align
employee or consultant that he or she will be subject to criminal charges or a
civil lawsuit if that person elects to change his or her employment status with
Align, unless we have good cause to believe criminal conduct has been or will
be committed or that a civil cause of action will lie against the employee or
consultant. The Court also required the Align Parties to refrain from taking
any actions inconsistent with Federal or State securities laws relating to the
issuance or redemption of Align stock. On March 1, 2005, the Court signed
a Stipulated Preliminary Injunction Order, whereby the Court ordered that the
express terms of the TRO remain in place until the earlier of (i) trial, (ii) written
agreement of the parties or further Court order setting an earlier termination,
or (iii) as to the preliminary injunction regarding non-solicitation or
recruiting of Align employees or consultants only, October 27, 2005.

The defendants and the Align Parties filed demurrers
to the complaint and the cross-complaint, respectively. On June 6, the
Court ruled on demurrers on the complaint filed by OrthoClear and denied
OrthoClear’s challenges to the core of our complaint—Align’s claims of
Misappropriation of Trade Secrets and Breach of Contract—by overruling the
OrthoClear demurrers to these causes of action. In addition, the Court granted
our request for permission to amend our original complaint to consolidate
several duplicative causes of action and to add specific evidence not available
to us when the original complaint was filed. OrthoClear did not oppose the
demurrer filed by us and amended its original pleading by filing a first
supplemental and amended cross-complaint.

On July 6, 2005, OrthoClear filed a demurrer to
our first amended complaint. On August 23, 2005, the Court issued an order
overruling all of OrthoClear’s demurrers. As a result, on September 9,
2005, OrthoClear filed answers to eleven causes of action brought by us. On
September 6, 2005, defendant Bao Tran filed answers to our causes of
action and also filed a cross-complaint against us. In September 2005, we
presented demurrers to OrthoClear’s first supplemental and amended
cross-complaint. In November 2005, the Court agreed with the Align Parties’
challenges to 18 of the 19 causes of action. Of the 18 causes of action
successfully challenged by Align, the Court ordered that 6 be dismissed
entirely. As to the remaining 12 challenged causes of action, OrthoClear is
required to either dismiss them or attempt to


state a valid claim
against the Align Parties. On December 5, 2005, OrthoClear filed a second
amended cross-complaint alleging unfair competition, intentional interference
with prospective economic advantage, intentional interference with contract,
libel, slander, breach of contract, wrongful withholding of wages, and abuse of
process. The second amended cross-complaint eliminates David Thrower as a
cross-defendant and attempts to add a new cross-defendant. On December 9, 2005,
defendant Bao Tran filed a first amended cross-complaint alleging wrongful
termination, intentional interference with contract, wrongful withholding of
wages, breach of contract, libel, slander, false light, abuse of process, and
unfair competition.

On January 4, 2006, the Align Parties filed a demurrer
to OrthoClear’s second amended cross-complaint, and a motion to strike the
portions of the second amended cross-complaint that refer to the new
cross-defendant. On January 12, 2006, the Align Parties filed a demurrer to Bao
Tran’s first amended cross-complaint and also filed special motions to strike
certain causes of action in both OrthoClear’s and Bao Tran’s cross-complaints. Bao
Tran subsequently agreed to dismiss his cause of action for abuse of process,
and in response Align has agreed to withdraw its special motion to strike Bao
Tran’s cross-complaint. The demurrers against OrthoClear’s second amended
cross-complaint and against Bao Tran’s first amended cross-complaint, the
motion to strike the portions of Orthoclear’s second amended cross-complaint
that refer to the new cross-defendant, and the special motion to strike certain
causes of action in OrthoClear’s second amended cross-complaint was heard on
February 27, 2006. The judge has taken the matters presented under submission
and no ruling has been issued.

No trial date has been set by the Court in this case.

Federal
Lanham Action.

On July 19, 2005, we filed a
multi-claim lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California against OrthoClear (the “Federal Lanham Action”). The
Federal Lanham Action alleges numerous violations of the federal Lanham Act (15
U.S.C. §1051 et seq.) by OrthoClear and its officers and employees. These
violations include unfair competition, trademark infringement and false
advertising. The Federal Lanham Action also alleges violations by OrthoClear of
California’s Unfair Practices Act (California Business and Professions Code
§17200 et seq.).

The Federal Lanham Action seeks monetary damages
according to proof at trial and an injunction preventing OrthoClear from
further false advertising and unfair competition including any use of our
trademarks or any advertising which deceives consumers into incorrectly
believing that OrthoClear has a program for training and certifying dentists
and orthodontists or that dentists or orthodontists have used OrthoClear to
successfully treat patients. We also seek an order requiring OrthoClear to
conduct corrective advertising to counteract its misleading advertising. A
trial date has been scheduled for October 30, 2006.

Patent
Infringement ITC Complaint.

On January 11,
2006, we filed a formal complaint with the United States International Trade
Commission (ITC) against OrthoClear, seeking to halt the importation into the
United States of infringing aligners manufactured by OrthoClear in Pakistan in
violation of our patents and other intellectual property rights (the “ITC
Complaint”). The ITC Complaint alleges that OrthoClear utilizes our trade
secrets and infringes 12 of our patents in the production of the OrthoClear
aligners at a facility in Lahore, Pakistan. The ITC Complaint requests the ITC
institute an immediate investigation and ultimately issue an exclusionary
order, enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, excluding OrthoClear
aligners from importation into the United States. The ITC Complaint also
requests the ITC issue two cease and desist orders specifically preventing
OrthoClear from importing infringing aligners and from selling in the United
States imported OrthoClear aligners. The ITC has announced that it has
instituted a formal investigation.

Patent Infringement
Federal Action.

On January 11, 2006, we
filed a federal court patent infringement action against OrthoClear in the
Western District of Wisconsin (Madison) (the “Patent Infringement Federal
Action”) asserting infringement of our U.S. Patents Nos. 6,685,469; 6,450,807;
6,394,801;


6,398,548;
6,722,880; 6,629,840; 6,669,037; 6,318,994; 6,729,876; 6,602,070; 6,471,511 and
6,227,850. The Patent Infringement Federal Action seeks monetary damages and an
injunction to augment the exclusionary relief available from the ITC.

Ormco

On January 6, 2003, Ormco Corporation (“Ormco”)
filed suit against us in the United States District Court for the Central
District, Orange County Division, asserting infringement of U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,447,432, 5,683,243 and 6,244,861. The complaint sought unspecified
monetary damages and injunctive relief. On February 18, 2003, we answered
the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the Court of
invalidity and non-infringement of the asserted patents. In addition, we
counterclaimed for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548, seeking
unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. Ormco filed a reply to our
counterclaims on March 10, 2003 and asserted counterclaims against us
seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity and non-infringement of U.S.
Patent No. 6,398,548. We amended our counterclaim to add Allesee
Orthodontic Appliances, Inc. (“AOA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ormco,
as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of U.S.
Patent No. 6,398,548. The Court then permitted Ormco to amend its
Complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim to add an additional
patent each. Ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of U.S.
Patent No. 6,616,444 on October 15, 2003. On October 27, 2003,
we filed an answer to Ormco’s first amended complaint and a counterclaim for
invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 and for
infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,554,611.

In connection with these claims, the Court granted
five motions for summary judgment that we filed. First, on May 14, 2004,
the Court granted our motion for summary judgment of non-infringement, finding
that our Invisalign system does not infringe any of the asserted Ormco patents
(5,477,432, 5,683,243, 6,244,861 and 6,616,644). Second, on July 2, 2004,
the Court granted in part our motion for summary judgment of infringement,
finding that Ormco and AOA infringe certain, but not all, claims of our patents
Nos. 6,398,548 and 6,554,611 through the manufacture and sale of Red, White &
Blue appliances. Third, on August 26, 2004, the Court granted our motion
for summary judgment of invalidity of Ormco’s asserted patents claims
(5,477,432, 5,683,243, 6,244,861 and 6,616,644). As noted above, the Court
earlier found that we do not infringe these patents. In addition, the Court
also denied Ormco’s and AOA’s motion for summary judgment seeking a finding of
invalidity of our asserted patent claims (6,398,548 and 6,554,611). Fourth, the
Court granted our summary judgment motion that our asserted patent claims are
not invalid based on the evidence currently before the Court. Although the
Court granted that motion, it reopened discovery on two additional invalidity
arguments Ormco and AOA asserted. Fifth, the Court also granted our summary
judgment motion that our patents are not unenforceable and granted Ormco’s and
AOA’s summary judgment motion that Ormco and AOA did not willfully infringe our
patents.

On December 20, 2004, we filed a further summary
judgment motion that our asserted claims are not invalid based on Ormco’s and
AOA’s new evidence. Ormco and AOA filed a counter-summary judgment motion that
our asserted claims are invalid based on this new evidence. The motions were
heard by the Court on February 7, 2005. On February 24, 2005, the
Court granted our motion in part, confirming the validity of all of the
asserted claims of our 6,554,611 patent and two of the asserted claims of our
6,398,548 patent. The Court also granted Ormco’s and AOA’s motion in part,
finding certain claims of our 6,398,548 patent to be invalid in view of prior
use evidence. On March 10, 2005, Ormco and AOA moved for reconsideration
of the Court’s ruling that Claims 10 and 17 of our U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548
are not invalid. On April 8, 2005, upon a motion for reconsideration made
by Ormco and AOA, the Court advised that it would adhere to its previous ruling
that Claims 10 and 17 of our 6,398,548 patent are not invalid.

On March 28, 2005, we filed a motion for
permanent injunction to prevent Ormco and AOA from selling the infringing Red,
White & Blue system. On May 26, 2005, the Court issued a
permanent injunction (the “Permanent Injunction”) to enjoin Ormco and AOA from
further infringement of Claims


10 and 17 of our 6,398,548
patent and Claims 1-3 and 7 of our 6,554,611 patent. On May 31,
2005, Ormco and AOA noticed an appeal to the Federal Circuit from the Permanent
Injunction. As of the date of this Report on Form 10-K, the
Permanent Injunction remains in full force and effect.

On February 1, 2006, we entered into a settlement
agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Ormco and AOA. Pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement, the issues of past damages, willfulness and attorneys’
fees for Ormco’s and AOA’s adjudged infringement of our U.S. patent Nos. 6,398,548
and 6,554,611 (the “Align Patents”) through the manufacture and sale by Ormco
and AOA of its Red, White & Blue appliances has been settled. The
Settlement Agreement does not affect (1) Ormco and AOA’s currently pending
appeal of the permanent injunction preventing Ormco and AOA from selling the
infringing Red, White & Blue system; (2) any appeal by Ormco of
the decisions and orders of the United States District Court relating to Ormco’s
patents; or (3) any appeal by us of the orders of the United States
District Court relating to our patents.

In accordance with the
terms of the Settlement Agreement, Ormco and AOA will pay us $884,000 (the “Settlement
Amount”) to resolve the issues of past damages, willfulness and attorneys’ fees
for the adjudged infringement of the Align Patents through the manufacture and
sale of Ormco’s and AOA’s Red, White & Blue appliances. The Settlement
Amount will be paid into escrow pending the completion of the appeals process. Our
receipt of the payments out of escrow is contingent upon the Court, in a final,
non-appealable judgment, finding that Ormco or AOA infringes at least one
of the claims in the Align Patents. If, however, the Court issues a final,
non-appealable judgment of non-infringement, invalidity or unenforceability
with respect to each asserted claim of the Align Patents, all funds in the
escrow account will be returned to Ormco and AOA. Once final judgment was
entered, Ormco filed a Notice of Appeal from the final judgment. The time has
not yet expired for us to file a cross-appeal on the few issues that were not
previously resolved in our favor.

Other matters

During fiscal 2005, requests were filed with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) by a San Francisco,
California, law firm, acting on behalf of an unnamed party, requesting
re-examination of six of our patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,975,893, 6,398,548,
6,309,215, 6,705,863, 6,217,325 and 6,722,880). The USPTO has granted the
request to reexamine five of the six patents, specifically, Patent No. 5,975,893,
Patent No. 6,398,548, Patent No. 6,309,215, Patent No. 6,705,863
and Patent No. 6,217,325. As of the date of this Report on Form 10-K,
the USPTO issued initial Office Actions with regard to US Patent Nos. 6,217,325
(the ‘325 patent), 6,309,215 (the ‘215 patent) and 5,975,893 (the ‘893 patent).
In these initial Office Actions, the examiners confirmed the validity of three
of the twenty-six claims of the ‘325 patent and five of the eleven claims of
the ‘215 patent without amendment and preliminarily rejected the remaining
claims of the patents. In addition, the examiners preliminarily rejected all
the claims in the ‘893 patent. These non-final initial Office Actions present
Align with its first opportunity to respond to the USPTO’s review and interpretation
of the prior art. We may and intend to submit amendments, affidavits or
declarations, or other documents as evidence of patentability in response to
its actions on the ‘325, ‘215 and ‘893 patents. The re-examination proceedings
on Patent Nos. 6,398,548, 6,705,863 (collectively, the “Remaining Patents”) are
currently pending but no Office Action has been received by us. While the
pending re-examinations are in a preliminary stage, we believe that claims of
the patents in re-examination will be determined to be patentable as currently
written or as may be amended during the re-examination
proceeding. However, there can be no assurance that we will prevail, and
re-examination proceedings could result in some or all of the Remaining
Patent claims (as well as the ‘215, ‘325 and ‘893 patent claims) having a
narrower scope of coverage or even to being invalidated, which could have an
adverse effect on us. On December 23, 2005, in a non-appealable, final
Order, the USPTO denied the request for re-examination with respect to all
twenty-one claims of our U.S. Patent No. 6,722,880 (the ‘880 patent). Accordingly,
the validity of all twenty-one claims of our ‘880 patent stand reaffirmed by
the


USPTO. On January 23,
2006, a Petition Seeking Review of Denial of Request for Re-examination of the ‘880
Patent was filed by the same San Francisco, California law firm. As of the date
of this Report on Form 10-K, we have not received a response from
the USPTO.

On July 25, 2005, Bay Materials, LLC (“Bay”)
filed suit against us in the Superior Court of the State of California for the
County of San Mateo. The complaint, as amended, asserts, among other things,
breach of contract, promissory estoppel, fraud and negligent misrepresentation
by us. Bay alleges that we breached the terms of a purchase order by failing to
pay for unshipped goods manufactured by Bay pursuant to such order. Bay further
alleges that we promised to purchase from Bay an alternative polyurethane
product, and Bay relied on this representation to develop such an alternative
product which we determined not to use. The complaint seeks monetary damages of
$1.1 million related to breach of contract and research and development costs
incurred plus unspecified damages related to lost profit, punitive and
exemplary damages, and legal expenses. We intend to vigorously defend
ourselves.

Litigating claims of these
types, whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us, is
costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical
personnel from normal business operations. Any of these results from litigation
could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price. From time to
time, we have received, and may again receive, letters from third parties
drawing our attention to their patent rights. While we do not believe that we
infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention, there may be
other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware.

MARKET
FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

(a) Price Range of Common Stock

Our
common stock is listed on The NASDAQ National Market under the symbol “ALGN.”
Public trading of our common stock commenced on January 26, 2001. Prior to
that date, there was no public market for our common stock. The following table
shows, for the periods indicated, the high and low per share closing prices of
our common stock, as reported by The NASDAQ National Market:

On February 24, 2006, the last reported sale
price of our common stock on The NASDAQ National Market was $8.38 per share. As
of February 24, 2006 there were approximately 277 holders of record of our
common stock. Because the majority of our shares of outstanding common stock is
held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable
to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record
holders.

We have never declared or
paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any
future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, in
December 2005, we renegotiated our existing revolving line of credit. The
new credit facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, our
ability to pay dividends.

Overview

Align Technology, founded in April 1997, designs,
manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating
malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion
using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently
move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of
metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the
aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is
appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition. We received
FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998, and we began commercial operations
in July 1999.

The Invisalign system is manufactured in phases. The
initial step in our manufacturing process is the creation of electronic
treatment plans using ClinCheck, an internally developed computer-modeling
program. These treatment plans are developed at our operations facility in
Costa Rica and are made available to the prescribing dental professional via
our proprietary customer interfacing software, VIP. The prescribing
orthodontist or general practitioner dentist (GP) then reviews the ClinCheck
simulation. ClinCheck allows the orthodontist or GP to simulate treatment in
three dimensions by modeling two-week stages of tooth movement. Upon the dental
professional’s approval of the ClinCheck simulation, we use the data underlying
the simulation, in conjunction with stereolithography (SLA) technology, to
manufacture Aligner molds. A third party shelter services provider located in Juarez,
Mexico uses these molds to fabricate Aligners. Aligners are thin, clear
plastic, removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to
correspond to each two-week stage of the ClinCheck simulation. Aligners are
customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by a
dental professional using ClinCheck. After the Aligners are produced, our third
party shelter services provider ships the finished products to our customers.

We generate the vast majority of our revenues from the
sales of the Invisalign system to orthodontists and GPs in the United States
and Canada, our domestic market. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
sales of Invisalign in our domestic GP channel and our domestic orthodontist
channel represented approximately 43% and 41% of our total revenues,
respectively.

A number of
factors, the most important of which are set forth below, may affect our
success during 2006 and beyond.

·

Increased Pricing Pressure.

In May 2005,
OrthoClear, Inc. announced the commercial launch of the OrthoClear System,
a product that is intended to compete directly with our Invisalign system. We
believe that OrthoClear’s product infringes on our intellectual property and we
have filed several lawsuits alleging, among other things, OrthoClear’s unlawful
use of our intellectual property, including our trade secrets.

See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this
Report on Form 10-K for a more complete summary of the OrthoClear
litigation.

In response to OrthoClear’s launch and in an effort to
simplify our pricing structure, in the fourth quarter of 2005 we announced that
all Invisalign cases (other than Invisalign Express) in our domestic market
will have a list price of $1,495 per case. Previously, list prices ranged from
$1,195 to $1,895 per case depending on the treatment option selected. In
addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, we expanded our volume based discount
program to all doctors.  We expect each
of these programs, and other similar programs that we may launch in 2006, to
adversely affect our revenue, gross margin and net profits.


·

Disruption in Sales Coverage and Customer Relationships.

In
the first half of 2005, 17 orthodontic sales representatives, representing
approximately 50% of our orthodontic sales force, left Align and joined
OrthoClear. We have replaced the majority of these individuals with new sales
representatives. Case submissions in our orthodontic channel were slightly
lower in the last two quarters of 2005 compared to the previous two quarters
due in part to the disruption in our sales force and the resulting disruption
to many of our key customer relationships. We are committed to train and
successfully deploy our new sales team and rebuild these disrupted customer
relationships.

See “Part I, Item 1A—Risk
Factors—We rely on our direct sales force to sell our products, any failure to
maintain our direct sales force could harm our business.”

·

Penetration into our Domestic Market.

Although we have
historically generated a majority of our revenues from orthodontists, there
exists a significantly greater number of GPs in North America than
orthodontists. As the primary provider of dental care, GPs have access to a
greater number of patients than orthodontists, and possess a unique opportunity
to educate these patients on the benefits of oral care and introduce them to
Invisalign. GPs also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to
orthodontists and may choose to treat less complex cases themselves. Largely
due to the fact that there are significantly more GPs than orthodontists, we
expect that an increasingly larger percentage of our revenues will be generated
by GPs. In fact, in fiscal 2005, our domestic GP channel generated 43% of our
total revenue, while the orthodontist channel represented 41%. We believe that
by focusing on increasing utilization rates among our existing GP customers,
the overall market for Invisalign will increase, as patients who would not have
otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to Invisalign by their
GPs. In addition, by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the
benefits of the Invisalign technique, we believe they will be more likely to
use this technology in their future practices and offer Invisalign as a
treatment option. In 2005, four dental schools, Harvard University, Columbia
University, Temple University and the University of Texas at San Antonio,
announced the integration of the Invisalign technique into their curriculums.
We expect additional dental schools to integrate the Invisalign technique into
their curriculums in the future.

·

Continued Product Leadership

.

We are committed to investing in delivering new
products, enhancing the user experience and introducing new product features to
our existing products. In the second half of 2005, we launched Invisalign
Express, a lower-cost Aligner system to be used for less complex cases. Invisalign
Express is intended to assist our customers to treat a broader range of
patients by providing a lower cost option for less complex orthodontic cases
thereby increasing the market for our products. In addition, we are currently
in the early testing of a bracket positioning template which, if successfully
launched, is intended to be used in conjunction with our digital treatment plan
in order to guide doctors in proper bracket placement in traditional wires and
bracket treatment. We are also planning to introduce a compliance indicator
which will help doctors and patients understand if the patients have worn their
Aligners for enough time to effectively move their teeth. By investing in
developing these new products and continually enhancing our existing products,
we expect to increase market share.

·

Expansion of International Markets.

We
will focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of Invisalign by dental
professionals in key international markets, including Europe and Japan. We will
consider expanding into additional international markets on a case by case
basis. In October 2005, we announced the launch of Invisalign in Japan. In
fiscal 2005, our international channel represented approximately 12% of our
total revenue.

·

Increasing
reliance on International Manufacturing Operations.

Our
manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future
profitability. We use a third party based in Juarez, Mexico, International
Manufacturing Solutions Operaciones, S.R.L. (“IMS”), for the fabrication and
packaging of Aligners. We are currently in the process of relocating our SLA
mold


fabrication
operations from our Santa Clara, California facility to IMS. We expect this
relocation to be complete by the second quarter of 2006. As a result of this
relocation, our reliance on our international manufacturing operations will continue
to increase. Our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of
management to effectively manage this international operation, including our
relationship with IMS. In addition, we currently are and will become
increasingly dependant on IMS’s ability to hire and retain employees generally,
as well as hire and retain employees with the necessary skills to perform the
more technical aspects of our operations. If our management and/or IMS fail in
any of these respects, we could experience production delays and lost or
delayed revenue. In addition, even if we have case submissions in the
manufacturing backlog, if IMS is unable for any of these or other reasons to
timely ship our product to our customers, our revenue will be delayed which will
cause our operating results to fluctuate.

See Part I,
Item 1A—Risk Factors for risks related to our international operations

Results of Operations

Comparison
of Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:

Revenues:

Invisalign
product revenues by channel and other revenue, which represented training and
sales of ancillary products, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, are as follows:

Revenue grew by 20% for the year ended December 31,
2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The growth in revenues
resulted primarily from an increase in overall case shipment volume in the
domestic GP channel driven by an increase in the number of participating
clinicians and the launch of Invisalign Express in the third quarter of 2005.
Additionally, international sales improved primarily as a result of increased
number of participating clinicians and case utilization by our European
practitioners.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, growth in
revenues from our domestic orthodontic and general practitioner channels over
fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from higher case volumes driven by an increase
in the number of participating clinicians and utilization within the general
practitioner practices. Higher product sales during fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003 also benefited from increased promotional advertising campaigns and
sales initiatives in effect during fiscal 2004.

For the fiscal year 2006,
although we expect our case shipment volume to increase, we anticipate that our
revenues will remain consistent with fiscal year 2005. In 2006, we will begin
to see the full impact of the lower average selling price resulting from both
the pricing initiatives we introduced during the fourth quarter of 2005, and
Invisalign Express, which we launched in the third quarter of 2005 and has a lower
average selling price than our full Invisalign product.


Cost of revenues:

Cost of revenues includes the salaries for staff
involved in the production process, the cost of materials, packaging, shipping
costs, depreciation on the capital equipment used in the production process,
training costs and the cost of facilities.

Gross margin improved to 69% of revenues for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 67% of revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2004. This improvement in gross margin is
primarily the result of cost savings achieved from manufacturing process
improvements and increased cost absorption due to higher production volumes
partially offset by increased training costs as a result of dental professionals
auditing training classes for no charge.

Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2004
improved to 67% of revenues, compared to 58% of revenues for the year ended December 31,
2003. The higher gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2004 was
primarily attributable to improved fixed cost absorption related to increasing
volumes, manufacturing process improvements in both our treatment operations
facility in Costa Rica and in the aligner fabrication process. Also included in
cost of revenues are stock-based compensation expenses of $0.9 million and $2.6
million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

For the fiscal year 2006,
we anticipate that our gross margin, including stock based compensation, will
decrease slightly, primarily as we begin to see the full impact of the lower
average selling price discussed in revenues above.

Sales and marketing:

Sales and marketing expense includes sales force
compensation (combined with travel related costs and expenses for professional
marketing programs), expenses relating to conducting workshops and market
surveys, advertising, and dental professional trade show attendance.

Sales and marketing expense increased by $24.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31,
2004. This increase was primarily related to incremental head-count which
resulted in higher payroll costs of $10.3 million, $6.7 million related to
increased advertising, media and trade show costs, an additional $4.8 million
on outside services and other sales and marketing support costs, and $2.4
million of expenses attributable to retention incentives and guarantees paid to
our sales force in response to the solicitation of our sales force by
OrthoClear during the first quarter of 2005.

The increase in sales and
marketing expense during fiscal 2005 was consistent with our marketing and
sales initiatives. We expect 2006 sales and marketing expense, including stock
based compensation, to be comparable to 2005, as we continue to develop and
expand our domestic and international markets, develop new media programs,
enhance our web site and provide clinical education. Sales and marketing


expense
increased by $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase resulted
primarily from an increase in spending of $4.4 million related to incremental
headcount in our North American sales and marketing work force, $0.9 million
related to North America sales force training, $2.7 million related to our
international workforce and outside services, and $5.9 million related to
increases in media, advertising costs, marketing promotions and other related
expenses. The increase in spending was partially offset by the decrease of $1.5
million in stock-based compensation expense. Sales and marketing expense
includes stock-based compensation expenses of $0.7 million and $2.2 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

General and administrative:

General and administrative expense includes salaries
for administrative personnel, outside consulting services, legal expenses and
general corporate expenses.

General and administrative expense increased by $8.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31,
2004. During 2005 we incurred $8.0 million of incremental expense related to
the OrthoClear litigation, which resulted from higher external legal and
consulting costs and the hiring of additional legal staff.

Compared to year ended December 31, 2003, general
and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2004, primarily due to the decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $4.4
million and legal fees of $2.4 million. The decrease in litigation spending was
primarily due to the settlement charge of $2.1 million included in general and
administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 related to
the conclusion of the Discus arbitration proceedings. The decreased expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2003 were offset by increases of $4.2 million in payroll expenses and $2.1
million in general corporate expenses.

For the fiscal year 2006, we expect that general and
administrative expenses will increase from fiscal 2005. This increase will be
primarily attributable to stock based compensation and OrthoClear related
expenses.

General and administrative
expenses include stock-based compensation expenses of $0.1 million, $2.7
million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Research and development:

Research and development expense includes the costs
associated with software engineering, the cost of designing, developing and
testing our products and conducting clinical and post-marketing trials. We
expense our research and development costs as they are incurred.


Research and development expense increased by $2.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31,
2004. The primary reasons for the higher expenses in 2005, compared to 2004,
were an increase of $1.3 million in outside services and consulting expenses,
$1.1 million of additional payroll related costs due to higher headcount and a
$0.4 million increase in training and other research and development expenses.

The $2.7 million increase in research and development
expense for the year ended December 31, 2004, over the year ended December 31,
2003, resulted from increased spending of $3.2 million for product improvement
initiatives and a $1.1 million severance charge related to the departure of our
Vice President, Engineering, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in
stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expenses included
$1.6 million and $3.2 million of stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

For fiscal 2006, we expect
a slight increase in research and development spending, including stock based
compensation, over 2005 as we continue to invest in research and development
efforts to bring new products to market, conduct clinical research and focus on
product improvement initiatives.

Interest and other income (expense), net, includes

currency translation gains and losses for the dollar against other currencies
related to international businesses and other miscellaneous charges.

Interest and other income
and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, included interest
income of $1.9 million, which resulted from higher interest rates and average
cash balances during 2005, offset by exchange losses of $1.0 million and $0.6
million of interest expense, bank charges and other expense. For year ended December 31,
2004, interest and other income and expense included interest income of $0.7
million, exchange gains of $0.3 million, offset by interest expense of $0.3

2003, interest income was $0.5 million, exchange gains were $0.4 million, which
were reduced by interest expense of $0.4 million and other expenses of $0.4

Our effective tax rate was 48.2%, 10.2% and 0.4% for
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, we have
recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing deferred tax assets due to
uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize these assets before they
expire. As a result, our income tax provision is based upon our operating
results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of
statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction.

At December 31, 2005, we had a net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $193.5 million for federal purposes and $66.9
million for California state tax purposes. If not utilized, these carryforwards
will begin to expire beginning in 2017 for federal purposes and 2007 for
California purposes. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on
the use of a corporation’s tax attributes if a corporation


undergoes an ownership
change for tax purposes. If an ownership change is determined to have occurred,
our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an
annual limitation. However, based on our current estimate of the total net
operating losses at December 31, 2005 and our current estimate of the
annual limitation had a change of ownership occurred, we do not expect current
utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards to result in a limitation
prior to utilization. At December 31, 2005, we had research credit
carryforwards of approximately $3.9 million for federal purposes and $4.6
million for California state tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal credit
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017. The California state credit can be
carried forward indefinitely.

We have not provided
additional U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations
as of December 31, 2005 because such earnings are intended to be
reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States.

In connection with the grant of stock options to
employees and non-employees prior to 2001, we recorded deferred stock-based
compensation as a component of stockholders’ equity. Stock based compensation
was fully amortized as of December 31, 2004. For options granted to
non-employees, we measure the option’s fair value using the Black-Scholes
valuation model at each reporting period and recognize stock based compensation
as options vest, which is generally four years. This stock-based compensation
is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options.

Historically, we have accelerated the vesting of
options to several employees in connection with severance packages. These
accelerations were accounted for as a charge to the consolidated statements of
operations. This charge is equal to the intrinsic value of the options which
was calculated as a difference between the exercise price of the accelerated
options and the fair value of the common stock on the date of the acceleration.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded
$0.1 million resulting from accelerated vesting of options in connection with
severance packages.

For the year ended December 31,
2004, deferred stock-based compensation expenses included $5.1 million of
amortization of deferred compensation expenses, $0.4 million of expense
relating to options granted to non-employees, and $0.4 million of expenses
resulting from accelerated vesting of options in connection with severance
packages.

For fiscal the year ended December 31,
2003 we recorded $12.8 million of amortization of deferred compensation
expense, $1.3 million of expenses relating to options granted to non-employees
and $0.9 million of expenses resulting from accelerated vesting of options in
connection with severance packages.

Option
Acceleration.

On October 6, 2005, the Compensation Committee of
our Board of Directors approved acceleration of the vesting for all unvested
stock options with exercise prices greater than $7.10. Options held by
non-employee directors are excluded from the vesting acceleration. As a result
of the acceleration, approximately 3.8 million options or 35% of the total
outstanding options became immediately exercisable as of October 6, 2005.
Of the aggregate number of options subject to the acceleration, approximately
1.2 million options or 32% of the total accelerated options were held by our
executive officers. Because the exercise price of all options subject to
acceleration was greater than the fair market value of our underlying


common stock on the date
of acceleration, we did not record any compensation expense, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.

The primary purpose of the
acceleration was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise
recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated
options upon the adoption of FAS 123(R). FAS 123(R) is effective for us
beginning in the first quarter of 2006, and will require that compensation
expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of
operations, rather than as a footnote disclosure in our consolidated financial
statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs—an amendment
of ARB No. 43” (“SFAS 151”), which is the result of its efforts to
converge U.S. accounting standards for inventories with International
Accounting Standards. SFAS No. 151 requires idle facility expenses,
freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) costs to be recognized
as current period charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed production
overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not
expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”) which requires the
measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants
of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of
such expense in our consolidated statements of income. In March 2005, the
SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, “Share-Based Payment” (“SAB
No. 107”) relating to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Beginning in the first
quarter of 2006, Align will adopt SFAS 123(R) under the modified prospective
transition method using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Under the new
standard, our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex
and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee
exercise patterns (expected life of the options), future forfeitures and
related tax effects. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we will begin
recording the fair value of our share-based compensation in our financial
statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment (Revised 2004).” Although the adoption of SFAS 123(R)
will have no adverse impact to our balance sheet and cash flows, it will
adversely affect our net profit (loss) and earnings (loss) per share. See Notes
1 and 7 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2005, the FASB issued Financial
Statement of Position (“FSP”) FAS 123(R)-2, “Practical Accommodation to
the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FAS 123(R)” (“FSP 123(R)-2”).
FSP 123(R)-2 provides guidance on the application of grant date as
defined in SFAS No.123(R). In accordance with this standard a grant date of an
award exists if a) the award is unilateral grant and b) the key terms and conditions
of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within
a relatively short time period from the date of approval. We will adopt this
standard when we adopt FAS 123(R) beginning in the first quarter of
2006, and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123(R)-3,
“Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
Awards” (“FSP 123(R)-3”). FSP 123(R)-3 provides an elective
alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at the
beginning balance of the accumulated paid-in capital pool related to employee
compensation and simplified method to determine the subsequent impact the
accumulated paid-in capital pool employee awards that are fully vested and
outstanding upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We are currently
evaluating this transition method.


In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS No. 154). SFAS No. 154 is a
replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3.
SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of
accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective
application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting
principle. SFAS No. 154 provides guidance for determining whether
retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable
and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable. SFAS
No. 154 also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by
restating previously issued financial statements. SFAS No 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. We do not believe that it will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In November 2005, the
FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“FSP
115-1 and 124-1”), which clarifies when an investment is considered
impaired, whether the impairment is other-than-temporary, and the measurement
of an impairment loss. It also includes accounting considerations subsequent to
the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain
disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as
other-than-temporary impairments. FSP 115-1 and 124-1 are effective
for all reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. At December 31,
2005, we have no unrealized investment losses that had not been recognized as
other-than-temporary impairments in our available-for-sale securities. We do
not anticipate that the implementation of these statements will have a
significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We fund our operations from the proceeds of the sale
of our common stock and from cash generated from sales of our product. Our cash
and cash equivalents balance improved for the year ended December 31,
2005, to $74.2 million from $69.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2004. Restricted cash was $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of
$290.4 million as of December 31, 2005.

We generated cash of $16.1 million and $24.6 million
from our operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year
ended December 31, 2005, resulted primarily from operating profits
adjusted for non cash items and increases in accrued liabilities partially
offset by reductions in accounts payable. For the year ended December 31,
2004, net cash was provided by operating activities primarily from operating
profits adjusted for non cash items and increases in accrued liabilities and deferred
revenue, which was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable.

We used $15.3 million of cash for our investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2005. This included $13.8
million of cash used to purchase capital assets, and $0.9 million of net cash
used to purchase General Orthodontics, LLC. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, we used $6.0 million of our cash in investing
activities, primarily to purchase property and equipment for capacity expansion
and manufacturing improvements, including approximately $3.2 million for the
implementation of the new version of our enterprise resource planning system
and new software for our manufacturing execution system. Partially offsetting
these purchases were proceeds from the sale of equipment and maturities of
marketable securities during fiscal 2004.


Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.7
million and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, and 2004, net cash
provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the issuance of
common stock, primarily from exercises of employee stock options, partially
offset by payments on debt obligations related to the equipment-based term loan
and capital lease obligations.

In December 2002, we obtained a $5.0 million
equipment-based term loan under our revolving line of credit. This loan
accrued interest at a rate of 2.25% above prime. During fiscal year 2005, we
paid down the outstanding balance of $1.7 million with interest, drawn under
this facility.

In December 2005, we
renegotiated and amended our existing revolving line of credit. The amended
credit agreement increases the available borrowings under the revolving line of
credit from $15 million to $20 million. Included in the new revolving line of
credit is a letter of credit facility of up to $5 million, a foreign exchange
facility of up to $5 million and an equipment facility of up to $10 million. We
may elect interest rates on our borrowing calculated by reference to bank’s
prime rate less one-half of one percent or LIBOR plus two percent. The new
credit facility matures on December 16, 2007, at which time all
outstanding borrowings must be repaid. The new credit facility contains certain
restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, financial covenants
requiring a minimum quick ratio and minimum tangible net worth, and covenants
limiting our ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions, be acquired,
incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, pay dividends and repurchase
stock. As of December 31, 2005, there was no outstanding borrowing under
these credit facilities.

Contractual Obligations / Off Balance Sheet
Arrangements

The
impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 are
expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows
(in thousands):

(1)

Includes an early
termination fee of approximately $220,000 on our facility in Amsterdam, The
Netherlands. The lease expires in 2014 with an option to cancel in 2009.

(2)

Equipment for
manufacturing operations in Mexico.

We have no significant contractual obligations not
fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the
notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no off-balance sheet
arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations promulgated under the
Securities Act.

As discussed under “Part I Item 3—Legal
Proceedings”, we are currently involved in litigation with various parties. Each
of these proceedings is in its early stages and it is not yet possible to
determine its ultimate outcome. At this time we cannot estimate the impact this
litigation may have on our future cash requirements.

We expect that our expense levels for 2006, including
stock based compensation, will increase from 2005, depending on our level of
business activity. We expect that any increases will be focused on continuing
efforts to automate our manufacturing processes, capacity expansion
requirements, the size of our sales force and dental professional training
staff, continued international sales and marketing efforts, legal expenses
including $10.0 million to $12.0 million related to OrthoClear litigation, and
research and


development expenses as we
develop new products and improvements to our existing product. In addition, we
may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies.
Our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our
ability to market, sell and support our products on a worldwide basis.

Our 2005 Incentive Plan allows for the issuance of
restricted stock units (“RSUs”), among other things. We have recently granted
RSUs, together with stock options,  to
certain of our employees. RSUs do not generate cash, as a result, by granting
RSUs we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our
common stock.

We believe that our
current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for
at least the next 12 months. If we are unable to generate adequate operating
cash flows, we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or
debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with other companies, bank
financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue
our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain
additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If
adequate funds are not available, we could be required to delay implementing
our business strategy and reduce our expenditures in general. Accordingly, the
failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Critical Accounting Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and
expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate
our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue
recognition, legal contingencies and income taxes. We use authoritative
pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for
making estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

We believe the following
critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We enter into arrangements
to sell products, services, and other arrangements (multiple element
arrangements) that include combinations of products. Revenue from product
sales, net of discounts and rebates, is recognized provided that persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Service revenues are
recorded when completed. Other multiple element arrangements require delivery
of products in the future. We use objective evidence of fair value to allocate
revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue
recognition have been met for each element. Revenue is deferred on the
undelivered element based on a historical usage rate and recognized when
delivery occurs. The amount of revenue deferred is affected by the historical
breakage factor, and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome,
requiring future adjustments to revenue.

Product Warranty

We warrant our products
against defects in materials and workmanship until the Invisalign case is
completed. We accrue for estimated warranty in costs of goods sold upon the
shipment of products. The amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are
primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as
current information on repair costs. Actual warranty costs could differ from
the


estimated
amounts. We regularly review the accrued balances and update these balances
based on historical warranty cost trends. Actual warranty costs incurred have
not materially differed from those accrued. If we were to experience higher
rates of warranty events, we would be required to accrue additional warranty
costs, which would negatively affect our operating results.

Legal contingencies

We are currently involved
in certain legal proceedings as discussed in Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Because of uncertainties related to both the potential
amount and range of loss from pending litigation, management is unable to make
a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result if there is an
unfavorable outcome in these legal proceedings. As additional information
becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to this
pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly. Revisions of our
estimates of such potential liability could materially impact our results of
operations and financial condition.

Deferred Tax
Valuation Allowance

We have established a full valuation allowance because
we believe the realization of our deferred tax assets is not likely. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences that result from
differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These
differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our
balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we
establish a valuation allowance. See Note 6 to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

While we have considered
future taxable income in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance,
we would decrease the valuation allowance to take into account deferred tax
assets that we could realize. A decrease in the valuation allowance could have
a favorable impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and
net income in the period in which we make the decrease.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of
business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate
risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations.

Interest Rate Risk

Changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated
interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable equity
securities. Periodically we invest our excess cash in low risk and short-term
available for sale marketable equity securities. These investments are
primarily at fixed interest rates. As of December 31, 2005, we had no
outstanding investments in available for sale marketable equity securities. Due
to the short duration of our cash equivalents and investments in marketable
equity securities, an immediate decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would
not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment
portfolio. Conversely, a hypothetical decline in interest rates of 100 basis
points could have an adverse impact on our future operating results and cash
flows of approximately $700 thousand as a result of lower interest income.

We do not have interest
bearing liabilities on our books as of December 31, 2005, and are not
subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases. An increase in
interest rates may affect our future cost of financing. In the past we had used
fixed rate long-term financing to minimize our risk on interest rates increases.


Currency Rate Risk

The functional currency of
Align and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar and, accordingly, gains and
losses resulting from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in Euro, Costa Rican Colon, and other currencies are reflected in
the determination of net income or loss. We do not enter into forward exchange
contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange translation gains and
losses. Included in interest and other expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2005, was an exchange loss of $1.0 million. For years 2004
and 2003 we experienced exchange gains of $0.3 million and $0.4 million,
respectively, primarily related to Euro denominated balances. An aggregate
decline of 10% in foreign currency exchange rates relative to USD may have an
adverse effect of approximately $2.0 million on our results of operations and
financial position.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Align
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Align’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that:

·

pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

·

provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and

·

provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Align’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.  In making this assessment, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.

Based
on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2005,
Align’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the
criteria issued by the COSO in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.

Management's
assessment of the effectiveness of Align’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which immediately follows this report.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Align
Technology, Inc. and subsidiaries:

We have completed
integrated audits of Align Technology, Inc.’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(i) present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Align Technology, Inc.
and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(ii) presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control
over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment,
included in Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing immediately above this report, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment
and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for


external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note
1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business
Description

Align Technology, Inc.
(“Align” or the “Company”) was incorporated in April 1997 and is engaged
in the development, manufacturing and marketing of Invisalign, used for
treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign uses a series
of clear plastic “Aligners” to move the patients’ teeth in small increments
from their original state to a final treated state.

Basis of
presentation

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.

Use of estimates
and reclassifications

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from those
estimates.

Certain reclassifications
have been made to prior period reported amounts to conform to the current year
presentation.

Fair value of
financial instruments

The carrying amounts of
the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and other current liabilities approximate the fair value. The carrying value of
marketable securities approximates their fair value as determined by market
quotes. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for debt
with similar terms, the carrying value of its debt obligations approximates
fair value.

Cash equivalents
and marketable securities

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. The Company
invests primarily in money market funds, commercial paper, and United States
government securities, accordingly, these investments are subject to minimal
credit and market risks.

Marketable securities are
classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Marketable
securities classified as current assets and have maturities of less than one
year. Unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Realized
gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in earnings and
computed using the specific identification cost method. Realized gains or
losses and charges for other-than-temporary declines in value, if any, on
available-for-sale securities are reported in other income or expense as
incurred. The Company periodically evaluates these investments for
other-than-temporary impairment. As of December 31, 2005, there were no
marketable securities held by the Company.


Restricted cash

The Company’s restricted
cash as of December 31, 2005 of $0.2 million and December 31, 2004 of
$0.3 million was primarily comprised of security against leasing arrangements
in Europe.

Foreign currency

The Company and its
subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Foreign currency
monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at
current exchange rates and non-monetary assets are re-measured at historical
rates. Revenues and expenses are re-measured at average exchange rates in
effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency re-measurement
are included in other income (expense). For the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company included in other income (expense) a loss of
$1.0 million, a gain of $0.3 million and a gain of $0.4 million, respectively.

Certain risks and
uncertainties

The Company’s operating results depend to a
significant extent on the Company’s ability to market and develop its products.
The life cycles of the Company’s products are difficult to estimate due in part
to the effect of future product enhancements and competition. The inability of
the Company to successfully develop and market its products as a result of
competition or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Financial instruments which potentially expose the
Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents
and accounts receivable. The Company invests excess cash primarily in money
market funds of major financial institutions, commercial paper and notes. The
Company provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. Collateral
is not required for accounts receivable, but ongoing evaluations of customers’
credit worthiness are performed. The Company maintains reserves for potential
credit losses and such losses have been within management’s expectations. No
individual customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s accounts
receivable at December 31, 2005 and 2004, or net revenues in fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003.

In the United States of America, the Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”) regulates the design, manufacture, distribution,
preclinical and clinical study, clearance and approval of medical devices. Products
developed by the Company may require approvals or clearances from the FDA or
other international regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales. There
can be no assurance that the Company’s products will receive any of the
required approvals or clearances. If the Company was denied approval or
clearance or such approval was delayed, it may have a material adverse impact
on the Company.

The Company has manufacturing operations located
outside the United States of America. The Company currently relies on its
manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica to create virtual treatment plans with
the assistance of sophisticated software. In addition, the Company relies on a
third party shelter services provider in Juarez, Mexico to fabricate Aligners
and to ship the completed product to the Company’s customers. The Company’s
reliance on international operations exposes it to related risks and
uncertainties, including difficulties in staffing and managing international
operations; controlling quality of manufacture; political, social and economic
instability; interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services;
product and/or material transportation delays or disruption; trade restrictions
and changes in tariffs; import and export license requirements and
restrictions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and potential adverse
tax consequences. If any of these risks materialize, the Company’s
international manufacturing operations, as well as its operating results, may
be harmed.


The Company receives
certain of its components from sole suppliers. Additionally, the Company relies
on a limited number of hardware manufacturers. The inability of any supplier or
manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could materially
impact future operating results.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at
the lower of cost or market, with cost computed on a first-in, first-out
basis.

Property and
equipment

Property and equipment are
stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon sale or retirement, the asset’s cost
and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the general ledger and
any related gain or loss is reflected in operations. Maintenance and repairs
are charged to operations as incurred.

Development costs
for internal use software

Costs relating to internal
use software are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of Statement
of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use (SOP 98-1). In 2004, the Company implemented
a new version of its enterprise resource planning system and new software for
the Company’s manufacturing execution system and capitalized approximately
$3,214,000 in related internal use software costs. As of December 31, 2005
and 2004, capitalized internal use software at cost was $4,416,000, and the
associated accumulated amortization was $2,164,000 and $881,000, respectively.
Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the
software, which generally range from three to five years.

Acquisition

In January 2005, the
Company acquired the membership interests of privately held General
Orthodontics, LLC (“GO”). The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and
accordingly, the operating results of GO have been included in the consolidated
financial statements since its date of acquisition. See Note 11 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Goodwill and other
intangible assets

Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and
identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill
is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances
occur which indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Other intangible assets
consist of acquisition-related intangible assets and are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three years,
reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected
to be realized.

Impairment of long-lived
assets

The Company regularly
monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate if the
carrying values of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be
recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company
assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the
carrying value of such assets will be recovered through future net undiscounted
cash flows. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceeds the fair value, as measured by the discounted future cash flows.


Product Warranty

The Company warrants its
products against material defects until the Invisalign case is completed. The
Company accrues for estimated warranty in costs of goods sold upon shipment of
products. The amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are primarily based on
historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on
repair costs. Actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts.
The Company regularly reviews the accrued balances and updates these balances
based on historical warranty cost trends. Actual warranty costs incurred have
not materially differed from those accrued. If the Company were to experience
higher rates of warranty events, the Company would be required to accrue
additional warranty costs, which would negatively affect its operating results.

Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains
allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of the Company’s customers to make payments. The Company periodically
reviews these estimated allowances, including an analysis of the customers’
payment history and information regarding the customers’ creditworthiness. If
the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting
in their inability to make payments, an additional allowance may be required
and would negatively impact the Company’s operating results.

Revenue Recognition

Align recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104 “Revenue Recognition” (“SAB 104”), and
Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-21 “Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). SAB 104 requires that four basic
criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Determination of
whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has
occurred or services rendered involve management’s judgments based on whether
the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.

Revenue from product sales, net of discounts and
rebates, is recognized upon shipment. Service revenues related to the training
of dental professionals and staff on the Invisalign treatment process, and case
consultations are recorded when the services are completed.

Align enters into multiple
element arrangements that involve the delivery of full Invisalign and case
refinement. Case refinement, which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient’s
teeth to the final desired position, is elected by the dental professional in
the last stages of orthodontic treatment. The Company uses objective evidence
of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when
the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. Revenue
allocated to full Invisalign is recognized upon shipment, and revenue allocated
to case refinement is considered an undelivered element and is deferred until
the shipment of case refinement. Through June 2005, Align deferred the
fair value of case refinement on 100% of full Invisalign cases shipped. For
these full Invisalign cases, case refinement revenue is recognized upon utilization
or case expiration, whichever occurs earlier. A full Invisalign case is deemed
expired six months after the expected end of treatment. Beginning in the third
quarter of fiscal 2005, Align began recognizing the fair value of case
refinement revenue upon shipment of full Invisalign based on a breakage factor,
which was determined by sufficient historical experience of case refinement
utilization. The Company believes that the use of a breakage factor is
reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of case refinement
utilization since case refinement was first offered. Although the Company has
seen no material changes in the breakage factor, the estimated breakage factor
may not continue in the future. If the average historical experience changes,
the breakage factor will be adjusted impacting revenue recognition for full
Invisalign shipments thereafter.


Research and
development

Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred.

Advertising costs

The cost of advertising
and media is expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003 advertising costs totaled $11.3 million, $6.3 million, and $5.0
million, respectively.

Income taxes

Income taxes are recorded
under the assets and liability approach, under which deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable
income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

Stock-based
compensation

Through 2005, the Company accounted for stock-based
employee compensation using the intrinsic value method under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“APB 25”) and related interpretations and complies with the disclosure
requirements of SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.”

The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to
non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 and Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity
Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees, or in Conjunction with
Selling Goods and Services,” and Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option or Award Plan” (“FIN 28”).

The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per common
share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
123 to stock-based employee compensation:


Such pro forma disclosure may not be representative of
future compensation cost because options vest over several years and additional
grants are anticipated to be made each year. See Note 7 for a discussion of the
assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model and estimated fair
value of options.

Option Acceleration.

On October 6, 2005, the
Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approved
acceleration of the vesting for all unvested stock options with exercise prices
greater than $7.10. Options held by non-employee directors were excluded from
the vesting acceleration. As a result of the acceleration, approximately 3.8
million options or 35% of the total outstanding options became immediately
exercisable as of October 6, 2005. Of the aggregate number of options
subject to the acceleration, approximately 1.2 million options or 32% of the
total accelerated options are held by the Company’s executive officers. Because
the exercise price of all options subject to acceleration was greater than the
fair market value of the Company’s underlying common stock on the date of
acceleration, the Company did not record any compensation expense in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

The primary purpose of the
acceleration was to eliminate future compensation expense the Company would
otherwise recognize in its statement of operations with respect to these
accelerated options upon the adoption of FAS 123(R). The Company will adopt FAS
123(R) beginning in the first quarter of 2006, and will require that
compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the
statement of operations, rather than as a footnote disclosure in the
consolidated financial statements.

Comprehensive Income (loss)

Comprehensive income
(loss), as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period
from non-owner sources. Net profit (loss) and other comprehensive income
(loss), including unrealized gains and losses on investments, are reported, net
of their related tax effect.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs—an amendment of ARB No. 43” (“SFAS 151”), which is the
result of its efforts to converge U.S. accounting standards for inventories
with International Accounting Standards. SFAS No. 151 requires idle
facility expenses, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) costs
to be recognized as current period charges. It also requires that allocation of
fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for
inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on
its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”) which requires the measurement of
all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in
our consolidated statements of income. In March 2005, the SEC released
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, “Share-Based Payment” (“SAB
No. 107”) relating to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Beginning in the first
quarter of 2006, Align will adopt SFAS 123(R) under the modified
prospective transition method using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Under the
new standard, the Company’s estimate of compensation expense will require a number
of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility,
employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options), future forfeitures
and related tax effects. Although the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have no
adverse impact to the Company’s balance sheet and cash flows, it will adversely
affect the Company’s net profit (loss) and earnings (loss) per share. See
“Stock-based compensation” above for the pro forma net income (loss) and net
income (loss) per share amounts, for fiscal 2003 through fiscal 2005, as if the
Company had used a fair-value-based method similar to the methods required
under SFAS 123(R) to measure compensation expense for employee stock
incentive awards.


In October 2005, the FASB issued Financial
Statement of Position (“FSP”) FAS 123(R)-2, “Practical Accommodation to
the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FAS 123(R)” (“FSP 123(R)-2”).
FSP 123(R)-2 provides guidance on the application of grant date as defined
in SFAS No.123(R). In accordance with this standard a grant date of an award
exists if a) the award is unilateral grant and b) the key terms and conditions
of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within
a relatively short time period from the date of approval. The Company will
adopt this standard when it adopts FAS 123(R) beginning in the first
quarter of 2006, and Align does not expect it will have a material impact on
the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123(R)-3,
“Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based
Payment Awards” (“FSP 123(R)-3”). FSP 123(R)-3 provides an elective
alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at the
beginning balance of the accumulated paid-in capital pool related to employee
compensation and simplified method to determine the subsequent impact the
accumulated paid-in capital pool employee awards that are fully vested an
outstanding upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Align is currently
evaluating this transition method.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS No. 154). SFAS No. 154 is
a replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3.
SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of
accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective
application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting
principle. SFAS No. 154 provides guidance for determining whether
retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable
and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable. SFAS
No. 154 also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by
restating previously issued financial statements. SFAS No 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that it will have a
material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

In November 2005, the
FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“FSP
115-1 and 124-1”), which clarifies when an investment is considered
impaired, whether the impairment is other-than-temporary, and the measurement
of an impairment loss. It also includes accounting considerations subsequent to
the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain
disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as
other-than-temporary impairments. FSP 115-1 and 124-1 are effective
for all reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. At December 31,
2005 Align had no unrealized investment losses that had not been recognized as
other-than-temporary impairments in its available-for-sale securities. The
Company does not anticipate that the implementation of these statements will
have a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Commitments and
Contingencies

Operating leases

Align rents its facilities and certain equipment and
automobiles under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements. Facility leases
expire at various dates through 2014 and provide for pre-negotiated fixed
rental rates during the terms of the lease.

In February 2005, the Company renewed its Santa
Clara headquarters lease allowing it to utilize the security deposit of
$1,269,000, paid at the inception of the lease on July 1, 2000, to reduce monthly
rent payment by $10,575. By the end of the lease term at June 30, 2010,
the security deposit balance will reduce to $634,500.

In June 2004, the Company’s European headquarters
signed a lease agreement for a facility in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This
lease expires in 2014 with an option to cancel in 2009 with a lease termination
fee of approximately $220,000. The Company anticipates it will cancel this
lease in 2009 and is accruing for the termination fee on a straight line basis.

The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease period, and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not
paid. Total rent expense was $4.3 million, $4.9 million and, $3.5 million for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Minimum
future lease payments for non-cancelable leases as of December 31, 2005,
are as follow (in thousands):

Equipment purchase
commitment

The Company agreed to
purchase additional capacity sterolithography (SLA) manufacturing equipment
from a certain vendor. During 2005, the Company paid $2.5 million of this
purchase commitment and will pay an additional $3.4 million during 2006, based
on the delivery dates for each machine. In the event the Company does not
accept delivery of any of the systems on or before December 31, 2006, the
Company has agreed to pay approximately 60% of the purchase price for each such
system that is not shipped, and the order for that system will be deemed
cancelled. The Company committed to the equipment purchase in order to secure
favorable pricing, delivery schedule and manufacturing capacity through
the middle of 2007.

Capitalized lease
obligations

In May and August 2000,
the Company leased two stereolithography machines from under a Master Lease
Agreement entered into in March 2000 for a total value of $1,479,000 at a
borrowing rate of 6.533% per annum for a period of 60 months. During 2005, the
Company paid the remaining balance of $187,000 including interest of $5,000 and
there were no capital lease obligations outstanding at December 31, 2005.


Note 4.   Legal Proceedings

OrthoClear

State Action.

On February 2,
2005, the Company filed a multi-claim lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior
Court against defendants OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear Holdings, Inc.,
Muhammad Ziaullah Chishti, Bao Tran, Peter Riepenhausen, Joe Breeland, Jeff
Tunnell, Christopher Kawaja, and Charles Wen (the “State Action”). Among other
things, the State Action alleges tort, contract, statutory and common law
causes of action arising from OrthoClear and the individual defendants’ alleged
plan to unlawfully utilize our intellectual property, confidential information
and employees. The State Action also alleges that OrthoClear, Chishti and other
defendants are in breach of contractual obligations, statutory law and common
law for attempting to intentionally interfere and disrupt the Company’s ongoing
business operations and improperly gain access to its customer relationships
and trade secrets. The State Action seeks injunctive relief and monetary
damages in an amount to be determined.

On February 15, 2005, OrthoClear, Chishti,
Riepenhausen, Breeland, Tunnell, Kawaja and Wen filed a multi-claim
cross-complaint against Align, Thomas Prescott, Roger George, Eldon Bullington,
David Thrower, Patricia Wadors, Gil Laks and Kelsey Wirth (collectively, the “Align
Parties”) alleging conspiracy, breach of contract, libel, slander, unjust
enrichment, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and
unfair competition. The cross-complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary
damages in an amount to be determined.

On February 18, 2005, the Court granted the
Company’s request for and issued a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”)
prohibiting OrthoClear and the individual OrthoClear defendants from engaging,
assisting, or participating, directly or indirectly, in soliciting, inducing to
leave, recruiting, or encouraging any current Align employee or consultant to
terminate or alter his or her employment or business relationship with Align or
attempting to do the same. The Court also granted the Company’s request and
issued a TRO prohibiting OrthoClear and the individual OrthoClear defendants
from disclosing, using, lecturing upon or publishing any of the Company’s
proprietary information without its express prior written permission. In
addition, in response to a cross-application for TRO filed by certain
OrthoClear defendants, the Court enjoined Chishti and the Align Parties from
disparaging each other in such a manner as to violate the mutual
non-disparagement clause contained in the Separation Agreement between Align
and Chishti dated as of March 27, 2002. The Court also enjoined the Align
Parties from advising any Align employee or consultant that he or she will be
subject to criminal charges or a civil lawsuit if that person elects to change
his or her employment status with Align, unless the Company has good cause to believe
criminal conduct has been or will be committed or that a civil cause of action
will lie against the employee or consultant. The Court also required the Align
Parties to refrain from taking any actions inconsistent with Federal or State
securities laws relating to the issuance or redemption of Align stock. On March 1,
2005, the Court signed a Stipulated Preliminary Injunction Order, whereby the
Court ordered that the express terms of the TRO remain in place until the
earlier of (i) trial, (ii) written agreement of the parties or
further Court order setting an earlier termination, or (iii) as to the
preliminary injunction regarding non-solicitation or recruiting of Align
employees or consultants only, October 27, 2005.

The defendants and the Align Parties filed demurrers
to the complaint and the cross-complaint, respectively. On June 6, the
Court ruled on demurrers on the complaint filed by OrthoClear and denied
OrthoClear’s challenges to the core of the Company’s complaint—Align’s claims
of Misappropriation of Trade Secrets and Breach of Contract—by overruling the
OrthoClear demurrers to these causes of action. In addition, the Court granted
the Company’s request for permission to amend its original complaint to
consolidate several duplicative causes of action and to add specific evidence
not available to the Company when the original complaint was filed. OrthoClear
did not oppose the demurrer filed by the Company and amended its original
pleading by filing a first supplemental and amended cross-complaint.


On July 6, 2005, OrthoClear filed a demurrer to
the Company’s first amended complaint. On August 23, 2005, the Court
issued an order overruling all of OrthoClear’s demurrers. As a result, on
September 9, 2005, OrthoClear filed answers to eleven causes of action
brought by the Company. On September 6, 2005, defendant Bao Tran filed
answers to the Company’s causes of action and also filed a cross-complaint
against the Align Parties. In September 2005, the Company presented
demurrers to OrthoClear’s first supplemental and amended cross-complaint. In
November 2005, the Court agreed with the Align Parties’ challenges to 18
of the 19 causes of action. Of the 18 causes of action successfully challenged
by Align, the Court ordered that 6 be dismissed entirely. As to the remaining
12 challenged causes of action, OrthoClear is required to either dismiss them
or attempt to state a valid claim against the Align Parties. On December 5,
2005, OrthoClear filed a second amended cross-complaint alleging unfair
competition, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,
intentional interference with contract, libel, slander, breach of contract,
wrongful withholding of wages, and abuse of process. The second amended
cross-complaint eliminates David Thrower as a cross-defendant and attempts to
add a new cross-defendant. On December 9, 2005, defendant Bao Tran filed a
first amended cross-complaint alleging wrongful termination, intentional
interference with contract, wrongful withholding of wages, breach of contract,
libel, slander, false light, abuse of process, and unfair competition.

On January 4, 2006, the Align Parties filed a demurrer
to OrthoClear’s second amended cross-complaint, and a motion to strike the
portions of the second amended cross-complaint that refer to the new
cross-defendant. On January 12, 2006, the Align Parties filed a demurrer to Bao
Tran’s first amended cross-complaint and also filed special motions to strike
certain causes of action in both OrthoClear’s and Bao Tran’s cross-complaints.
Bao Tran subsequently agreed to dismiss his cause of action for abuse of
process, and in response Align has agreed to withdraw its special motion to
strike Bao Tran’s cross-complaint. The demurrers against OrthoClear’s second
amended cross-complaint and against Bao Tran’s first amended cross-complaint,
the motion to strike the portions of Orthoclear’s second amended
cross-complaint that refer to the new cross-defendant, and the special motion
to strike certain causes of action in OrthoClear’s second amended
cross-complaint was heard on February 27, 2006. The judge has taken the matters
presented under submission and no ruling has been issued.

No trial date has been set by the Court in this case.

Federal Lanham Action

.   On
July 19, 2005, the Company filed a multi-claim lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California against
OrthoClear (the “Federal Lanham Action”). The Federal Lanham Action alleges
numerous violations of the federal Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. §1051 et seq.) by
OrthoClear and its officers and employees. These violations include unfair
competition, trademark infringement and false advertising. The Federal Lanham
Action also alleges violations by OrthoClear of California’s Unfair Practices
Act (California Business and Professions Code §17200 et seq.).

The Federal Lanham Action seeks monetary damages
according to proof at trial and an injunction preventing OrthoClear from
further false advertising and unfair competition including any use of our
trademarks or any advertising which deceives consumers into incorrectly
believing that OrthoClear has a program for training and certifying dentists
and orthodontists or that dentists or orthodontists have used OrthoClear to
successfully treat patients. The Company also seeks an order requiring
OrthoClear to conduct corrective advertising to counteract its misleading
advertising. A trial date has been scheduled for October 30, 2006.

Patent Infringement ITC Complaint

.   On
January 11, 2006, the Company filed a formal complaint with the United
States International Trade Commission (ITC) against OrthoClear, seeking to halt
the importation into the United States of infringing aligners manufactured by
OrthoClear in Pakistan in violation of our patents and other intellectual
property rights (the “ITC Complaint”). The ITC Complaint alleges that
OrthoClear utilizes our trade secrets and infringes 12 of the Company’s patents
in the production of the OrthoClear aligners at a facility in Lahore, Pakistan.
The ITC Complaint requests the


ITC institute an immediate
investigation and ultimately issue an exclusionary order, enforced by U.S.
Customs and Border Protection, excluding OrthoClear aligners from importation
into the United States. The ITC Complaint also requests the ITC issue two cease
and desist orders specifically preventing OrthoClear from importing infringing
aligners and from selling in the United States imported OrthoClear aligners. The
ITC has announced that it has instituted a formal investigation.

Patent Infringement Federal Action

.   On
January 11, 2006, the Company filed a federal court patent infringement
action against OrthoClear in the Western District of Wisconsin (Madison) (the
“Patent Infringement Federal Action”) asserting infringement of our U.S.
Patents Nos. 6,685,469; 6,450,807; 6,394,801; 6,398,548; 6,722,880; 6,629,840;
6,669,037; 6,318,994; 6,729,876; 6,602,070; 6,471,511 and 6,227,850. The Patent
Infringement Federal Action seeks monetary damages and an injunction to augment
the exclusionary relief available from the ITC.

Ormco

On January 6, 2003, Ormco Corporation (“Ormco”) filed
suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Central
District, Orange County Division, asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos.
5,447,432, 5,683,243 and 6,244,861. The complaint sought unspecified monetary
damages and injunctive relief. On February 18, 2003, the Company answered the
complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the Court of
invalidity and non-infringement of the asserted patents. In addition, the
Company counterclaimed for infringement of its U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548,
seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. Ormco filed a reply
to the Company’s counterclaims on March 10, 2003 and asserted
counterclaims against the Company seeking a declaration by the Court of
invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548. The Company
amended its counterclaim to add Allesee Orthodontic Appliances, Inc. (“AOA”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Ormco, as a counterdefendant in regard to the
Company’s counterclaim of infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548. The Court
then permitted Ormco to amend its Complaint and permitted the Company to amend
its counterclaim to add an additional patent each. Ormco filed a first amended
complaint for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 on October 15,
2003. On October 27, 2003, the Company filed an answer to Ormco’s first amended
complaint and a counterclaim for invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent
No. 6,616,444 and for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,554,611.

In connection with these claims, the Court granted
five motions for summary judgment that the Company filed. First, on May 14,
2004, the Court granted the Company’s motion for summary judgment of
non-infringement, finding that the Company’s Invisalign system does not
infringe any of the asserted Ormco patents (5,477,432, 5,683,243, 6,244,861 and
6,616,644). Second, on July 2, 2004, the Court granted in part the Company’s
motion for summary judgment of infringement, finding that Ormco and AOA
infringe certain, but not all, claims of the Company’s patents Nos. 6,398,548
and 6,554,611 through the manufacture and sale of Red, White & Blue
appliances. Third, on August 26, 2004, the Court granted the Company’s motion
for summary judgment of invalidity of Ormco’s asserted patents claims
(5,477,432, 5,683,243, 6,244,861 and 6,616,644). As noted above, the Court
earlier found that the Company does not infringe these patents. In addition,
the Court also denied Ormco’s and AOA’s motion for summary judgment seeking a
finding of invalidity of the Company’s asserted patent claims (6,398,548 and
6,554,611). Fourth, the Court granted the Company’s summary judgment motion
that its asserted patent claims are not invalid based on the evidence currently
before the Court. Although the Court granted that motion, it reopened discovery
on two additional invalidity arguments Ormco and AOA asserted. Fifth, the Court
also granted the Company’s summary judgment motion that its patents are not
unenforceable and granted Ormco’s and AOA’s summary judgment motion that Ormco
and AOA did not willfully infringe the Company’s patents.

On December 20, 2004, the Company filed a further
summary judgment motion that it’s asserted claims are not invalid based on
Ormco’s and AOA’s new evidence. Ormco and AOA filed a counter-


summary judgment motion
that the Company’s asserted claims are invalid based on this new evidence. The
motions were heard by the Court on February 7, 2005. On February 24,
2005, the Court granted the Company’s motion in part, confirming the validity
of all of the asserted claims of our 6,554,611 patent and two of the asserted
claims of our 6,398,548 patent. The Court also granted Ormco’s and AOA’s motion
in part, finding certain claims of the Company’s 6,398,548 patent to be invalid
in view of prior use evidence. On March 10, 2005, Ormco and AOA moved for
reconsideration of the Court’s ruling that Claims 10 and 17 of the Company’s
U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548 are not invalid. On April 8, 2005, upon a
motion for reconsideration made by Ormco and AOA, the Court advised that it
would adhere to its previous ruling that Claims 10 and 17 of our 6,398,548
patent are not invalid.

On March 28, 2005,
the Company filed a motion for permanent injunction to prevent Ormco and AOA
from selling the infringing Red, White & Blue system. On May 26,
2005, the Court issued a permanent injunction (the “Permanent Injunction”) to
enjoin Ormco and AOA from further infringement of Claims 10 and 17 of the
Company’s 6,398,548 patent and Claims 1-3 and 7 of the Company’s
6,554,611 patent. On May 31, 2005, Ormco and AOA noticed an appeal to the
Federal Circuit from the Permanent Injunction. As of the date of this Form 10-K,
the Permanent Injunction remains in full force and effect. The Company’s
remedies for Ormco’s and AOA’s adjudged infringement remain at issue. See
Footnote 14 Subsequent Events for a discussion of the settlement agreement.

Other matters

During fiscal 2005, requests were filed with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) by a San Francisco,
California, law firm, acting on behalf of an unnamed party, requesting re-examination
of six of the Company’s patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,975,893, 6,398,548,
6,309,215, 6,705,863, 6,217,325 and 6,722,880). The USPTO has granted the
request to reexamine five of the six patents, specifically, Patent No. 5,975,893,
Patent No. 6,398,548, Patent No. 6,309,215, Patent No. 6,705,863
and Patent No. 6,217,325. As of the date of this Report on Form 10-K,
the USPTO issued initial Office Actions with regard to US Patent Nos. 6,217,325
(the ‘325 patent), 6,309,215 (the ‘215 patent) and 5,975,893 (the ‘893 patent).
In these initial Office Actions, the examiners confirmed the validity of three
of the twenty-six claims of the ‘325 patent and five of the eleven claims of
the ‘215 patent without amendment and preliminarily rejected the remaining
claims of the patents. In addition, the examiners preliminarily rejected all
the claims in the ‘893 patent. These non-final initial Office Actions present
the Company with its first opportunity to respond to the USPTO’s review and
interpretation of the prior art. The Company may and intends to submit “amendments,
affidavits or declarations, or other documents as evidence of patentability” in
response to its actions on the ‘325, ‘215 and ‘893 patents. The re-examination
proceedings on Patent Nos. 6,398,548, 6,705,863 (collectively, the “Remaining
Patents”) are currently pending but no Office Action has been received by us. While
the pending re-examinations are in a preliminary stage, the Company believes
that claims of the patents in re-examination will be determined to be
patentable as currently written or as may be amended during the re-examination
proceeding. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will
prevail, and re-examination proceedings could result in some or all of the
Remaining Patent claims (as well as the ‘215, ‘325 and ‘893 patent claims)
having a narrower scope of coverage or even to being invalidated, which could
have an adverse effect on the Company. On December 23, 2005, in a
non-appealable, final Order, the USPTO denied the request for re-examination
with respect to all twenty-one claims of our U.S. Patent No. 6,722,880
(the ‘880 patent). Accordingly, the validity of all twenty-one claims of our ‘880
patent stand reaffirmed by the USPTO. On January 23, 2006, a Petition
Seeking Review of Denial of Request for Re-examination of the ‘880 Patent was
filed by the same San Francisco, California law firm. As of the date of this Form 10-K,
the Company has not received a response from the USPTO.

On July 25, 2005, Bay Materials, LLC (“Bay”)
filed suit against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California
for the County of San Mateo. The complaint, as amended, asserts, among other


things, breach of
contract, promissory estoppel, fraud and negligent misrepresentation by the
Company. Bay alleges that we breached the terms of a purchase order by failing
to pay for unshipped goods manufactured by Bay pursuant to such order. Bay
further alleges that the Company promised to purchase from Bay an alternative
polyurethane product, and Bay relied on this representation to develop such an
alternative product which the Company determined not to use. The complaint
seeks monetary damages of $1.1 million related to breach of contract and
research and development costs incurred plus unspecified damages related to
lost profit, punitive and exemplary damages, and legal expenses. Given the
early stage of this action, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of
this matter at this time although the Company intends to vigorously defend
itself. As a result, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 5 “Accounting for Contingencies”, the Company has disclosed
the existence of this lawsuit; however, no accrual for potential losses, if
any, has been recorded.

Litigating claims of these
types, whether or not ultimately determined in the Company’s favor or settled
by the Company, is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of the Company’s
management and technical personnel from normal business operations. Any of
these results from litigation could adversely affect the Company’s results of
operations and stock price. From time to time, the Company has received, and
may again receive, letters from third parties drawing the Company’s attention
to their patent rights. While the Company does not believe that it infringes
any such rights that have been brought to the Company’s attention, there may be
other more pertinent proprietary rights of which the Company is presently
unaware.

Note 5.   Credit Facilities

In December 2002, the Company obtained a
$5.0 million equipment-based term loan under its revolving line of
credit. This loan accrued interest at a rate of 2.25% above prime. During
fiscal year 2005, the Company paid down the outstanding balance of $1.7 million
plus interest, drawn under this facility.

In December 2005, the
Company renegotiated and amended its existing revolving line of credit. The
amended credit agreement increases the available borrowings under the revolving
line of credit from $15 million to $20 million. Included in the new
revolving line of credit is a letter of credit facility of up to $5 million, a
foreign exchange facility of up to $5 million and an equipment facility of up
to $10 million. The Company may elect interest rates on its borrowing
calculated by reference to bank’s prime rate less one-half of one percent or
LIBOR plus two percent. The new credit facility matures on December 16,
2007, at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid. The new credit facility
contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, financial
covenants requiring a minimum quick ratio and minimum tangible net worth, and
covenants limiting the Company’s ability to dispose of assets, make
acquisitions, be acquired, incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments,
pay dividends and repurchase stock.


Note 6.   Income Taxes

Significant
deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands):

The Company has provided a full valuation allowance at
December 31, 2005 because Align believes that the net deferred tax assets
are unlikely to be realized.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $193.5 million for federal
purposes and $66.9 million for California state tax purposes. If not utilized,
these carryforwards will begin to expire beginning in 2017 for federal purposes
and 2007 for California purposes. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual
limitation on the use of a corporation’s tax attributes if a corporation
undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes. 
If an ownership change is determined to have occurred, the Company’s
ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an
annual limitation. However, based on the Company’s current estimate of the
total net operating losses at December 31, 2005 and the Company’s current
estimate of the annual limitation had a change of ownership occurred, the
Company does not expect current utilization of its net operating loss
carryforwards to result in a limitation prior to utilization.

The Company has research credit carryforwards of
approximately $3.9 million for federal purposes and $4.6 million for California
state tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal credit carryforwards will
begin to expire in 2017. The California state credit can be carried forward
indefinitely.

The Company has not provided additional U.S. income
taxes on undistributed earnings from non- U.S. operations as of December 31,
2005 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside
of the United States.


The
differences between income taxes using the federal statutory income tax rate of
35% and the Company’s effective tax rate were as follows:

The
provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in thousands):

Note 7.   Stockholders Equity

Preferred Stock

As of December 31,
2005, the Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001
par value, none of which was issued and outstanding. Pursuant to the
Certificate of Designation of Rights and Privileges of Series A
Participating Preferred Stock filed on October 26, 2005,
200,000 shares of such preferred stock have been designated as Series A
Participating Preferred Stock.

Preferred Stock
Rights Agreement

On October 25, 2005,
pursuant to a Preferred Stock Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) between
the Company and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. as the Rights Agent, the Company’s
Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right (a “Right”) to purchase one
one-thousandth share of the Company’s Series A Participating Preferred
Stock (“Series A Preferred”) for each outstanding share of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share of the Company. The dividend was paid on November 22,
2005 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on that date. Each
Right entitles the registered holder, subject to the terms of the Rights
Agreement, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A
Preferred at an exercise price of $37.00, subject to adjustment. The Rights
will be separate from the shares of Common Stock. Rights Certificates will be
issued and the Rights will become exercisable upon the earlier of (a) the
tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Company’s
Board of Directors) after a public announcement that a person or group of
affiliated or associated persons (“Acquiring Person”) has acquired beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, or (b) the
tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Company’s
Board of Directors) after a person or group announces a tender or exchange
offer, the consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group
of 15% or more of the Company’s


then
outstanding shares of Common Stock. An Acquiring Person does not include
certain persons specified in the Rights Agreement. The Rights will expire on
the earliest of (i) November 22, 2015, or (ii) redemption or
exchange of the Rights as described below. As of December 31, 2005, no
rights were exercised.

Common Stock

The holders of common
stock are entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available
and when and if declared by the Board of Directors. The Company has not
declared or paid any dividends as of December 31, 2005.

Stock Option Plans

In May of 2005,
stockholder approval was obtained for the 2005 Incentive Plan (“2005 Plan”),
and as a result, the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2001 Plan”) was
terminated. The 2005 Plan, which expires December 31, 2010, provides for
the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options,
restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance
shares. Employees, non-employee directors and consultants are eligible to
receive grants under the 2005 Plan. The options are granted for periods not
exceeding ten years and generally vest over 4 years with 25% vesting one year
from the date of grant and 1/48

th

each month thereafter. The Plan Administrator
may, however, grant options with different vesting schedules at its option. In
the first quarter of 2005, the Company granted options that vest over 3 years,
with 25% vested at the date of grant, and 1/36

th

each month thereafter. Options are to be
granted at an exercise price not less than fair market value at the date of
grant. The 2005 Plan has 9,983,379 shares of the Company’s common stock
reserved for issuance, plus up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares that are or
would have been returned to the 2001 Plan as a result of termination of
outstanding options or repurchase of shares granted under the 2001 Plan on or
after March 28, 2005. Under the 2001 Plan, authorized shares automatically
increased each January 1

st

by an amount equal to the lesser of 3 million
shares or 5% of the Company’s shares as of the prior fiscal year end. As of December 31,
2005, 1,105,604 options have been transferred to the 2005 Plan. Options
available for grant under the 2005 Plan as of December 31, 2005 were
9,433,824.

Executive Grants

In January 2001, the stockholders approved two
option grants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to
purchase shares at an exercise price of $15.00 per share to each of the
Company’s then Chief Executive Officer and President. The options were granted
outside of the 1997 Plan and prior to the adoption of the 2001 Plan or the 2005
Plan. As of December 31, 2005, an aggregate of 500,000 options to purchase
shares of common stock remained outstanding under these grants.


Activity
under the stock option and executive grant plans are set forth below (in
thousands, except per share data):

The
options outstanding and currently exercisable by exercise price at December 31,
2005 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):


The
fair value of options granted was estimated at grant date using a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The decrease in the
expected life assumption used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to 4.5 years
for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 5.0 years for the
prior years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, is the result
of granting options with shorter vesting in 2005.

Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

In January 2001, the Board of Directors adopted
and the stockholders approved the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“the Purchase
Plan”). The Purchase Plan, consists of twenty-four month offering periods with
four six-month purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase
shares at 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at either the
beginning of the purchase period or the end of the purchase period, whichever
price is lower. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had reserved
7,433,456 shares of common stock for future issuance and 6,234,792 shares
remain available for future issuance. Under the Purchase Plan, the Company sold
approximately 374,000, 429,000 and 194,000 shares of common stock during the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions:

Stock-based
compensation

In connection with the grant of stock options prior to
our initial public offering (“IPO”) in 2001 and certain grants subsequent to
the IPO, the Company recorded deferred stock compensation and amortized
stock-based compensation expense over the option vesting period of four years
using the straight-line method. The Company had fully amortized the deferred
stock-based compensation balance as of December 31, 2004. For the years
ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, Align recorded amortization of deferred
stock-based compensation of $5.1 million and $12.8 million, respectively.
If the employee terminated employment and therefore cancel any unvested
options, the Company reversed the unamortized deferred stock-based compensation
related to those options. During fiscal 2004, and 2003, Align reversed $0.1
million, and $1.0 million, respectively, of unrecognized deferred compensation
for terminated employees.

For options granted to non-employees, the Company
measures the options’ fair value using the Black-Scholes model at each
reporting period and recognizes stock based compensation expense as the options
vest. The vesting period is generally over four years from the date of grant. For
the fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 Align recorded stock-based compensation
expense of $45 thousand, $0.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively, related
to stock options granted to non-employees.


The Company accelerated the vesting of options to
several employees in connection with related severance packages. In accordance
with FASB Interpretation No. 44 (FIN 44), the acceleration charges are
measured based on the intrinsic value method, which is the difference between
the market value of common stock at the acceleration date and the exercise
price of the option. Acceleration charges for December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 were $67 thousand, $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively.

Stock
based compensation has been recorded as follows (in thousands):

Note
8.   Employee Benefit Plan

In January 1999, the
Company adopted a defined contribution retirement plan under Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers substantially all employees who
meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a
portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Company
contributions to the plan may be made at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. There have been no contributions by the Company since the inception
of the plan.

Note
9.   Net profit (loss) per share

Basic net profit (loss)
per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common
stock during the year less unvested common shares subject to repurchase.
Diluted net profit per share is computed using the weighted average number of
shares of common stock, adjusted for the dilutive effect of potential common
stock. Potential common stock, computed using the treasury stock method,
includes options and unvested shares subject to repurchase.

The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net profit
(loss) per share attributable to common stock (in thousands, except per share
amounts):


The
following table sets forth potential shares of common stock that are not
included in the diluted net profit (loss) per share available to common
stockholders because to do so would be anti-dilutive for the years

Note 11.   Acquisitions

In January 2005, the Company acquired all of the
membership interests of privately held General Orthodontics, LLC (“GO”). GO is
the sole premier provider of consulting and education services to general
practitioner dentists (“GP”) and orthodontists using the Invisalign orthodontic
appliance. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results
of GO from the date of acquisition.

The
purchase price of $1.3 million was accounted for as a business combination and
allocated to the acquired assets, goodwill and other identified intangibles, as
follows (in thousands):

The valuation of the consultant relationships
represent the fair value of consultant services which include direct consulting
services to GO’s customers on the use of the Invisalign technology and training
of GP dentists and orthodontists at the Company’s certification training
sessions. Consultant relationships and other intangible assets are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of three
years.


In accordance with the
Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to contingent
earn-outs of up to $1.0 million payable to certain former holders of GO
membership interests upon the achievement of milestones defined in the
agreement. These contingent payments are accrued on a straight-line basis based
on the estimated completion dates. The Company paid $0.5 million related to
milestone completion in July 2005 and expects to pay the remaining amounts
during the first half of 2006.

Note
12.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In January 2005, the Company completed the
acquisition of GO (See Note 11) and recorded $0.5 million of goodwill. Goodwill
is the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the acquired
net assets and the identified intangible assets. Upon the integration of GO,
Align included GO’s consulting services in its clinical education and training
programs under the name of Invisalign Consulting Services.

As required by SFAS 142, the Company performs its
annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, or more
frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine if the
recorded goodwill is impaired. In performing this assessment, Align compared
the fair value of its single business segment to its carrying value, and
determined that no goodwill impairment existed as of December 31, 2005.

During 2003, the Company
obtained a patent for $180,000 and is amortizing it over the expected useful
life of five years. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, the Company recorded amortization expense of $36,000, $36,000 and $9,000,
respectively. Estimated future amortization expense for the patent for the
years ending December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008, is $36,000, $36,000 and
$27,000, respectively.

Note 14.   Subsequent
Events.

On February 1, 2006,
the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”)
with Ormco and AOA. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the issues of past
damages, willfulness and attorneys’ fees for Ormco’s and AOA’s adjudged
infringement of Align’s U.S. patent Nos. 6,398,548 and 6,554,611 (the “Align
Patents”) through the manufacture and sale by Ormco and AOA of its Red, White &
Blue appliances has been settled. The Settlement Agreement does not affect (1) Ormco
and AOA’s currently pending appeal of the permanent injunction preventing Ormco
and AOA from selling the infringing Red, White & Blue system; (2) any
appeal by Ormco of the decisions and orders of the United States District Court
relating to Ormco’s patents; or (3) any appeal by us of the orders of the
United States District Court relating to Align’s patents.

In accordance with the
terms of the Settlement Agreement, Ormco and AOA will pay Align $884,000 (the “Settlement
Amount”) to resolve the issues of past damages, willfulness and attorneys’ fees
for the adjudged infringement of the Align Patents through the manufacture and
sale of Ormco’s and AOA’s Red, White & Blue appliances. The Settlement
Amount will be paid into escrow pending the completion of the appeals process. Our
receipt of the payments out of escrow is contingent upon the Court, in a final,
non-appealable judgment, finding that Ormco or AOA infringes at least one of
the claims in the Align Patents. If, however, the Court issues a final,
non-appealable judgment of non-infringement, invalidity or unenforceability
with respect to each asserted claim of the Align Patents, all funds in the
escrow account will be returned to Ormco and AOA. The Company will record the
Settlement Amount when it is realizable. Once final judgment was entered, Ormco
filed a Notice of Appeal from the final judgment. The time has not yet expired
for us to file a cross-appeal on the few issues that were not previously
resolved in our favor.
