ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.

Overview

Since our inception in April 1997,
we have been engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of Invisalign, a proprietary system for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. The Invisalign product has two components: ClinCheck

™

and Aligners. ClinCheck

™

is an Internet-based application that allows dental professionals to simulate
treatment, in three dimensions, by modeling two-week stages of tooth movement. Aligners are thin, clear plastic, removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two-week stage of the ClinCheck

™

simulation. Aligners are customized to perform the
treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using ClinCheck

™

.

Two of our key
production steps are performed in operations located outside of the U.S. At our facility in Costa Rica, technicians use a sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans, which are transmitted
electronically back to the U.S. These electronic files form the basis of ClinCheck

™

and are used in conjunction with stereolithography technology to manufacture Aligner molds. A third party manufacturer in Mexico fabricates Aligners from the molds and ships the completed products to our
customers.

Revenue from the sale of Invisalign and ancillary
products is recognized upon product shipment, provided that no significant obligations remain, transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable. The costs of producing the ClinCheck

™

treatment plan, which are incurred prior to the production of Aligners, are
deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned, i.e. upon shipment of the Aligners.

In cases where the dental professional elects to finish the treatment plan using Invisalign, the dental professional orders case refinement. From June 2001 through April 2003, we offered our dental professionals the
opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount. The advance purchase price was non-refundable. Revenue, in the amount of the stand-alone sales price of the undelivered element, is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case
refinement or case expiration. In cases where the dental professional did not purchase case refinements in advance, case refinement revenues are recognized when the new Aligners are shipped.

In May 2003, we updated our domestic pricing policy to include the future
delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer additional case refinements at a price of $125 each, which we believe represents its fair value based on competitive product offerings. Revenue deferrals associated with future
case refinement sales are $125 per case. This revenue deferral amount represents the fair value of a case refinement as determined in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables (EITF 00-21), which addresses the issue of accounting for



arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services. These revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been
utilized or upon case expiration, which ever is earliest.

Service revenues earned for training of dental professionals and staff for Invisalign are recorded as the services are performed. Service revenues earned under agreements with third parties are based on negotiated rates, which are intended
to approximate a mark-up on our anticipated costs.

We estimate
and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales, if any, in the period such sales occur. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon
historical discounts and rebates.

Industry Background

Malocclusion

Malocclusion, the misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent
clinical dental conditions, affecting over 200 million individuals, or approximately 75% of the U.S. population. Approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the U.S., generating industry revenues of approximately $7
billion. While most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance, malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay, tooth loss, gum disease, jaw joint pain and headaches. Because of the compromised
aesthetics, discomfort and other drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments, only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek traditional treatment.

Traditional Orthodontic Treatment

Currently, dental professionals apply traditional techniques and principles of orthodontic treatment developed in the early
20th century. In the U.S., dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal archwires and brackets, commonly referred to as braces. Occasionally, dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic,
tooth-colored brackets or bond brackets on the inside, or lingual surfaces, of the patient’s teeth. Dental professionals also augment braces with elastics, metal bands, headgear and other ancillary devices.

The average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and
requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement, or chair time. To initiate treatment, a dental professional will diagnose a patient’s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan. In a subsequent visit, the dental
professional will bond brackets to the patient’s teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets. Thereafter, by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks, the dental professional is able to exert
sufficient force on the patient’s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement. Because of the length of time between visits, the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the
interval. In a final visit, the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient’s teeth.

Fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between U.S. $3,500 to $7,000 with a median fee of approximately $4,500; generally only a
portion of the fees are reimbursed by insurance, if covered at all. In addition, dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives. Fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental
professional’s estimate of chair time, and are generally negotiated in advance. A treatment that exceeds the dental professional’s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time, or reduced profitability
for the dental professional.



Limitations of Traditional Orthodontic Treatment

Although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of
malocclusions, they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages. Conventional orthodontic treatment is associated with:

•

Unattractive appearance

.    Braces call attention to the patient’s condition and treatment. In addition, braces trap food, which can further
compromise appearance. Braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth. Many adults associate braces with adolescence. As a result of these and other limitations, less than one half of one percent of American adults with malocclusion
elect traditional orthodontic treatment annually.

•

Oral discomfort

.    Braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth. The tightening or adjustment of braces
results in root and gum soreness and discomfort, especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit.

•

Poor oral hygiene

.    Braces compromise oral hygiene by making it more difficult to brush and floss. These problems can result in tooth decay and
periodontal damage. Additionally, the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth.

•

Inability to project treatment

.    Historically, dental professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment.
Accordingly, dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan and project treatment. As a result, they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits. This lack of predictability
may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professional’s ability to estimate the duration of treatment. Because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis, extended treatment duration reduces
profitability for the dental professional.

•

Physical demands on dental professional

.    The manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity, and may place
other physical burdens on the dental professional.

•

Root resorption

.    The sustained high levels of force associated with conventional treatment can result in root resorption, which is a shortening of
tooth roots. This shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient.

•

Emergencies

.    At times, braces need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis. Such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the
patient and the dental professional.

Due to the
poor aesthetics, discomfort and other limitations of braces, relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment. Accordingly, we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient
concerns. We also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability.

The Align Solution

Invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion. Invisalign consists of two components: ClinCheck

™

and Aligners.

ClinCheck

™

.    ClinCheck

™

is an interactive Internet application that allows dental professionals to diagnose
and plan treatment for their patients. We use a dental impression and a treatment prescription submitted by a dental professional to develop a customized, three-dimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of
two-week increments. ClinCheck

™

allows the dental
professional to view this three- dimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle. Accordingly, ClinCheck

™

enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible.



Upon review of the ClinCheck

™

simulation, the dental professional may immediately approve the projected treatment, or may provide us with feedback
for modification. We reflect any requested adjustments in a modified simulation. Upon the dental professional’s approval of the ClinCheck

™

simulation, we use the data underlying the simulation to manufacture the patient’s Aligners.

Aligners

.    Aligners are custom-manufactured,
clear, removable dental appliances that, when worn in a prescribed series, provide orthodontic treatment. Each Aligner covers a patient’s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn. Aligners are commonly worn in pairs, over the upper and lower
dental arches. Aligners are generally worn for consecutive two-week periods which correspond to the approved ClinCheck

™

treatment simulation. After two weeks of use, the patient discards the Aligners and replaces them with the next pair in the series. This process is
repeated until the final Aligners are used and treatment is complete. Upon completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or her discretion, have the patient use Invisalign Aligners as a retainer or go directly to a conventional
retainer.

Benefits of Invisalign

We believe that Invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and
patients that have the potential to establish Invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces.

Benefits to the dental professional

•

Ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes

.    ClinCheck

™

enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely outcome of treatment in an interactive
three-dimensional computer model. ClinCheck

™

allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient.

•

Begin using Invisalign with minimal additional training

.    The biomechanical principles that underlie Invisalign are consistent with those of traditional
orthodontics. Although dental professionals can complete our initial training within two days, Invisalign provides additional education and clinical support.

•

Ease of use

.    When treating patients with Invisalign, dental professionals do not spend their time manipulating wires and brackets. This allows them to
spend proportionately more time diagnosing and interacting with their patients.

•

Expanded patient base

.    We believe that Invisalign has the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics. Currently, less than one percent of the
over 200 million people with malocclusion in the U.S. enter treatment each year. We believe that Invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment.

•

Decreased dental professional and staff time

.    We believe that Invisalign reduces both the frequency and length of patient visits. Invisalign eliminates
the need for time-intensive processes such as bonding appliances to the patient’s teeth, adjusting archwires during the course of treatment and removing the appliances at the conclusion of treatment. As such, use of Invisalign reduces dental
professional and staff chair time and can increase practice throughput.

•

Practice productivity

.    We believe that as dental professionals move to a higher volume of Invisalign patients, the dental professionals will be able to
better leverage their existing resources, including office space and staff time, resulting in an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity.

Benefits to the Patient

•

Excellent aesthetics

.    Aligners are nearly invisible when worn, eliminating the aesthetic concerns associated with conventional braces.



•

Comfort

.    By replacing the six-week adjustment cycle of traditional braces with two-week stages, Aligners move teeth more gently than conventional
braces. Also, Aligners are thin, smooth and low in profile. As a result, Aligners are substantially more comfortable and less abrasive than conventional braces.

•

Improved oral hygiene

.    Patients can remove Aligners for tasks that are difficult with conventional braces, such as eating, brushing and flossing. We
believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay and periodontal damage during treatment, which may result from conventional braces.

•

Potentially reduced overall treatment time

.    Aligners control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth. In addition, the
ClinCheck

™

simulation from which Aligners are
produced is designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements. Together, these factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to conventional braces.

•

Potentially reduced root resorption

.    We believe that controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root
resorption.

•

Reduced incidence of emergencies

.    Typically, a lost or broken Aligner is simply replaced with the next Aligner in series, minimizing inconvenience to
both patient and dental professional.

We
believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of conventional braces.

Limitations of Invisalign

In some instances, Invisalign may have certain limitations relative to conventional treatment. Aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces, and
we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in conventional treatment. Depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional, the cost of Invisalign to the patient may be greater than for
conventional braces. Dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan. Once a dental professional submits a case to us, there is generally a turn-around time of a month or more before the
corresponding Aligners are delivered. Aligners may not be appropriate for all cases, such as severe malocclusion, which may require Aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal results. In addition, because Aligners are
removable, treatment using Invisalign depends on patients wearing their Aligners as recommended. Some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing Aligners that may mildly affect speech. We believe that these limitations are
outweighed by the many benefits of Invisalign to both patients and dental professionals.

Our Target Market and Patient Base

Medical devices are classified into one of three classes based on the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness. Class I or II devices require the manufacturer to submit a pre-market
notification to the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, requesting permission for commercial distribution, which is known as 510(k) clearance. We obtained our 510(k) clearance in September 1998. Our 510(k) clearance allows us to market
Invisalign to treat patients with any type of malocclusion with mature dentition. We voluntarily restrict the use of Invisalign to adults and adolescents with mature dentition. Individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and
substantially complete jaw growth. This group represents approximately 160 million people in the U.S. Typically, permanent dentition are fully erupted between the ages of 11 and 15 years. Currently, we do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are
still developing, as the effectiveness of Invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment. Based on our clinical studies to date, we recommend that dental professionals use Invisalign as a
complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for severe malocclusions.



Approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the U.S. These patients
represent approximately one percent of the population of people with malocclusion. Of these, we estimate 50%, or more than one million patients, have mature dentition and are therefore potential candidates for Invisalign.

In addition, we believe that we have an immediate and substantial market
expansion opportunity. Our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations. We believe that, since Invisalign addresses the primary
limitations of braces, persons with malocclusion will be more likely to seek treatment. We believe that adults, who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment, represent our most significant market expansion
opportunity.

Commercial sales of Invisalign commenced in the
U.S. in July 1999. As of December 31, 2003 approximately 155,000 patients worldwide had entered treatment using Invisalign. Internationally, the Company operates through three business segments divided among the geographic regions of Europe,
Asia-Pacific and Latin America. In 2003, international sales accounted for approximately 9% of the Company’s net sales.

In each of fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues.

We continue to focus on the domestic market opportunity and on selected
international markets.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to establish Invisalign as the standard method for treating
orthodontic malocclusion. Key elements of our strategy include the following:

Educate dental professionals and stimulate demand for Invisalign treatment

.    Our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not
elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations. By communicating the benefits of Invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers, we intend to increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic treatment annually. We advertise
nationally using a broad marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand and to reinforce the breadth of applicability of Invisalign. In October 2001, we expanded our training of dental professionals in our domestic market to include
general practitioner dentists. As of December 31, 2003, we had trained approximately 24,000 dental professionals worldwide on the use and benefits of Invisalign.

Expand and enhance manufacturing capability

.    Our manufacturing operations are designed to
produce large numbers of custom Aligners at a high level of quality. To improve cost efficiency, we conduct labor intensive processes in relatively low-wage countries. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements
and that additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations. Our proprietary software underlies our manufacturing process. By continually developing this software and other manufacturing processes,
we plan to increase the level of production automation. Increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce both unit costs and production times.

Extend and defend technology leadership

.    Invisalign represents a significant technological advancement in orthodontics.
We believe that our issued patents, multiple pending patents and other intellectual property provide us with a substantial lead over potential competitors. Our issued U.S. patents broadly cover the Invisalign

®

system, including digital modeling and manipulation of scanned patient data, treatment
planning, and fabrication of dental appliances, among others. We continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through U.S. and foreign patent applications and non-disclosure agreements. We also seek to protect our software,
documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws.



Expand number of clinicians and utilization within their
practices.

Invisalign can provide complete treatment for patients with mature dentition and a broad range of malocclusion. In addition, we believe that Invisalign can provide partial treatment of severe malocclusion. In an
effort to demonstrate Invisalign’s ability to comprehensively treat such cases, we have published a series of clinical case studies and articles that highlight the applicability of Invisalign to malocclusion cases of severe complexity. We have
also launched new studies in fiscal 2003 with universities worldwide and we are making additional improvements to our product. We are also expanding the clinical education and training sessions for our customers.

Manufacturing

We produce highly customized, highly precise, medical quality products in volume. To do so, we have developed a number of
proprietary processes and technologies. These technologies include complex software solutions, computed tomography, known as CT scanning, stereolithography and automated Aligner fabrication.

We believe the complexity inherent in producing such highly customized
devices in high volumes is a barrier to potential competitors. Furthermore, we believe the sophisticated software we use to guide a custom manufacturing process on a high volume was not available until we developed it. We rely on two vendors who are
each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process. In the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products, we would experience a manufacturing disruption
while we qualify and obtain an alternate source.

Manufacturing
is coordinated in Santa Clara, California. Digital dental modeling is processed in our 63,000 square foot facility in San Jose, Costa Rica. As of December 31, 2003, we employed a manufacturing staff in the U.S. and Costa Rica of approximately 427
people. The operations team in Costa Rica creates ClinCheck

™

treatments using simulation software. We outsource the fabrication and packaging of Aligners to a contract manufacturer based in Juarez, Mexico. Information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations may be
found in Part II, Item 7 of this Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”

The Invisalign Treatment Process

The Invisalign treatment process comprises the following five stages:

Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us

.    In an initial patient visit, the dental professional
determines whether Invisalign is an appropriate treatment. The dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinyl-siloxane, or PVS, impression of the relevant dental arches, x-rays of the patient’s
dentition, photographs of the patient, a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patient’s upper and lower dental arches and an Invisalign treatment planning form, or prescription. The impression is a critical component of
Invisalign as it depicts the three-dimensional geometry of the patient’s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models. An impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material. This material hardens, capturing the shape of
the patient’s teeth. The prescription is also a critical component of Invisalign, describing the desired positions and movement of the patient’s teeth. The dental professional sends the treatment data to our Santa Clara facility.

Preparation of three-dimensional computer models of the
patient’s initial malocclusion

.    Upon receipt, we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition. Using CT scanning, we scan the PVS impression to develop a digital,
three-dimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition. We then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional’s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in Costa
Rica.

Preparation of computer-simulated treatment and
viewing of treatment using ClinCheck

™

.    In Costa Rica we transform this initial digital model into a customized, three-dimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two-week increments. This
simulation is then reviewed for adherence



to prescribed clinical, treatment and quality standards. Upon passing review, the simulation is then delivered to the prescribing dental professional via
ClinCheck

™

, which is available on our website at
www.invisalign.com and www.aligntech.com. The dental professional then reviews the ClinCheck

™

simulation and, on occasion, asks us to make adjustments. By reviewing and amending the treatment simulation, the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and, thus,
participates in the customized design of the Aligners. At this point, the dental professional may also invite the patient to review ClinCheck

™

, allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment. The dental professional then approves the proposed treatment and, in doing so, engages
us for the manufacture of corresponding Aligners.

Construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment

.    We use the approved ClinCheck

™

simulation to construct a series of molds of the patient’s teeth. Each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each two-week stage of the
simulated course of treatment. These molds are fabricated at our Santa Clara, California manufacturing facility using custom manufacturing techniques, including stereolithography, that we have adapted for use in orthodontic applications.

Manufacture of Aligners and shipment to the dental
professional

.    From these molds, our contract manufacturer in Mexico fabricates Aligners by pressure-forming polymeric sheets over each mold. The Aligners are then trimmed, polished, cleaned and packaged. Following final
inspection, the Aligners are shipped directly to the prescribing dental professional. We ship all of the Aligners in a single batch. In certain cases, dental professionals may use Invisalign in conjunction with clear attachments bonded to the
patient’s teeth. These attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the Aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement.

In certain cases, we provide an aligner-like template to the dental
professionals to aide the placement of bonding attachments to the patient’s teeth. These attachments are used to optimize the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the Aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the
desired movements. Also, in cases where interproximal reduction, or IPR, is requested by the dental professional, we provide an IPR prescription form, quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction, location, and timing of
IPR.

Throughput Management

Because we manufacture each case on a build-to-order basis, we do not build
inventories. As a result, we must conservatively build manufacturing throughput for anticipated demand. To increase throughput, we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes.

In order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, we focus
our efforts on software development and the improvement of rate-limiting processes, or bottlenecks. We continue to upgrade our proprietary, three-dimensional treatment-planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce
time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case, thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in Costa Rica. We are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication of Aligners currently conducted in Mexico.
In order to scale our manufacturing capacity, we continue to invest in facilities and capital equipment.

Quality Assurance

Align’s quality system is in compliance with Food & Drug Administration’s Medical Device regulations, 21CFR Part 820, and Health
Canada’s Medical Device Regulations. We are certified to ISO 9001:1994, internationally recognized quality system standards, and ISO 13485:1996, internationally recognized standards for Medical Device manufacturing. Align has a formal,
documented quality system by which quality objectives are understood and achieved. Our quality system defines processes and procedures to ensure product and service quality, and includes methods to monitor levels of quality, based on internal data
and direct customer feedback. We utilize this data to continuously improve our systems and processes, taking corrective action as required.



Since we custom manufacture Aligners on a build-to-order basis, we do not offer refunds on our products.
Because each ClinCheck

™

and each Aligner is
unique, we inspect 100% of the product at various points in the manufacturing process, to ensure that the product meets our customers’ expectations. Aligners are subject to the Invisalign product warranty, which covers defects in materials and
workmanship. Our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the Invisalign case is completed. In the event the Aligners fall within the scope of the Invisalign product warranty, we will replace the Aligners at our expense. Our warranty is
contingent upon proper use of the Aligners for the purposes for which they are intended. If a patient chooses not to wear the Aligners, and as a result, requests additional Invisalign treatment, the dental professional pays the additional expense of
the replacement Aligners.

The Invisalign product warranty does
not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using Invisalign. Actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved ClinCheck

™

treatment plan. Deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological
factors, such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth. Warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient’s dentition to us. We use the impressions to create a new
ClinCheck

™

treatment plan for the dental
professional to approve, from which a successive series of Aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment.

In the event that a dental professional wishes to effect additional adjustments to a patient’s treatment when the actual treatment results are in
accordance with the approved ClinCheck

™

treatment
plan, the dental professional may request a case refinement or additional Aligners. Our pricing policy includes the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and offers additional case refinements at the dental
professional’s expense. In addition, should a dental professional request a replacement for a lost Aligner, we charge the dental professional for the cost of the replacement Aligner.

Sales and Marketing

We market Invisalign by communicating Invisalign’s benefits directly to dental professionals and consumers with a nationwide advertising campaign.
Based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales in our test markets, we believe that making consumers aware of Invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for Invisalign. In order to serve anticipated
worldwide demand, we are training a broad base of dental professionals.

Professional Marketing

Our sales and support
staff has been engaged in marketing Invisalign to orthodontists since July 1999. In 2001, we began marketing Invisalign to general practitioner dentists in our domestic market. We provide training, certification, marketing and clinical support to
orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in the U.S. and Canada, which we consider our domestic market, and internationally.

As of December 31, 2003, we had trained approximately 24,000 dental professionals worldwide to use Invisalign. Of those dental professionals trained,
approximately 70% are dental professionals in our domestic market. Within our domestic market, we have trained approximately 7,700 orthodontists and approximately 9,700 general practitioner dentists. Our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training
primarily in a workshop format. The key topics covered in training include Invisalign applicability, instructions on filling out the Invisalign prescription form, clinical tips and techniques guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with
our ClinCheck

™

software and the many other
features of our website.

Invisalign relies on the same
orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment, and we present our training material in a manner consistent with dental professionals’ training and experience. Our success in training a large number of dental professionals confirms
our belief that training represents a minimal barrier to adoption for most dental professionals.



After training, sales representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff
is prepared to handle Invisalign cases. Such follow up may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions, establishing an Internet connection and familiarizing them with our website. Sales representatives may also provide
practice-building assistance, including helping the dental professional to market Invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media. Many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region
with our assistance.

General practitioner dentists play an
important role in informing their patients about orthodontics and are a key source of both referrals to orthodontists and Invisalign case submissions. There are over 130,000 active general practice dentists in the U.S. and Canada.

Consumer Marketing

Our national consumer marketing efforts primarily focus on television
advertising and are supported by other advertising media and public relations. We advertise nationally using a broad marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand.

Our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources:

•

an orthodontist;

•

a general practice dentist;

•

direct-to-consumer mail advertising and public relations efforts;

•

other Invisalign patients;

•

our toll-free support line (1-800-INVISIBLE); and

•

our website, which can be accessed at either www.invisalign.com or www.aligntech.com.

Our marketing efforts have generated substantial consumer interest directed toward our telephone support line and our
website. Our telephone support line and our website not only provide consumers with information on Invisalign, but also allow us to channel consumer interest to dental professionals. We have outsourced the telephone support function to a national
call center operator.

Research and Development

Prior to commercial launch in July 1999, our research and development
strategy had three primary objectives: developing the Invisalign product, establishing the ability of Invisalign to treat malocclusion and developing software and processes to enable the manufacture of Aligners in volume. Since our commercial
launch, our research and development effort has focused on extending the range of dental applicability of Invisalign, enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our Invisalign system product lines. Our research and
development expenses were $13.1 million for fiscal 2003 and 2002, and $15.6 million in fiscal 2001.

In an effort to demonstrate Invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities, we have published a series of clinical case studies and articles that
highlight the applicability of Invisalign to malocclusion cases, including those of severe complexity. We are also undertaking post-marketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process. Our
product development team is testing enhanced materials and a number of complementary products that we expect will provide additional revenue opportunities.

In fiscal 2003, we continued to enhance our proprietary, three-dimensional treatment-planning software primarily to increase our manufacturing capacity
and efficiency.



Intellectual Property

We believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage. As of December 31, 2003, we had 41 issued U.S. patents, 73
pending U.S. patent applications, and numerous foreign issued patents, as well as pending foreign patent applications.

We continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through U.S. and foreign patent applications and non-disclosure agreements. We also seek to
protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be
issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products.

Competition

We compete directly with companies such as Ormco Orthodontics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sybron Dental Specialties, which manufactures and distributes
a product called Red, White & Blue, that is similar in use to Invisalign. We compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of other orthodontic products. These manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances include 3M
Company, Ormco Orthodontics and Dentsply International, Inc.

We believe that in addition to price, the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following factors:

•

aesthetic appeal of the treatment method;

•

comfort associated with the treatment method;

•

oral hygiene;

•

effectiveness of treatment;

•

ease of use; and

•

dental professionals’ chair time.

We believe that Invisalign compares favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors.

Government Regulation

FDA’s Quality System Regulation for Medical Devices.

Invisalign is regulated as a Class I
medical device by Food and Drug Administration. Accordingly, our product development, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling, handling, storage and distribution activities are subject to extensive review by National and State government
agencies to ensure that our devices are safe and effective.

The Aligners are manufactured by The TECMA Group, LLC, formerly known as Elamex S.A. de C.V., a contract manufacturer based in Mexico. As a medical device company, we are required to ensure that our contract manufacturer complies with
FDA’s Quality System regulations. As a result, we have ensured that TECMA is registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. In addition, TECMA is certified to ISO 9000 requirements and is subject to inspection by an independent ISO
agency. We have also ensured that our quality system procedures and processes are set up at TECMA to comply with all FDA regulations. TECMA has dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel for the manufacture and distribution of
Invisalign. We conduct frequent visits to the Mexico facility to monitor TECMA’s performance and its compliance with our requirements and also perform independent audits of their quality system.



In November 1998, Invisalign received 510(k) Pre-Market clearance by the FDA, allowing us to market
Invisalign in the U.S. The manufacture and distribution of Invisalign are subject to continuing regulations by the FDA. We are subject to routine inspections by the FDA and State agencies to determine compliance with Quality System requirements. Our
facility is registered with the State of California as a medical device manufacturer.

During inspections of our facility, if FDA determines that we have failed to comply with the applicable FDA regulations, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us, ranging from a public Warning
Letter to more severe sanctions, including but not limited to financial penalties, withdrawal of our right to market products and criminal prosecution.

Health Canada’s Medical Device Regulations.

In Canada, we comply with the Health Canada’s Medical
Device Regulations and as such Align’s facility and products are registered with Health Canada. We are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted permission to market our products in Canada.

European Union’s MDD Requirements & ISO 9000 and ISO
13485.

In Europe, Invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such, we follow the Medical Device Directives requirements and are registered with the Competent Authority in Europe. The fact that we are ISO 9000 and
ISO 13485 certified facilitates commercialization of Invisalign outside the United States and especially in Europe.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

.    Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996, or HIPAA, Congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information. Confidentiality of patient records and the
circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, referred to as the Privacy Standard, and other state laws and
regulations. The Privacy Standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information. Although compliance is principally the responsibility of the hospital, physician or other healthcare provider, our agreements with
orthodontists and other healthcare professionals require that we comply with the Privacy Standard when providing technical services and when handling patient information and records. We have designed our product and service offerings to enable
compliance with HIPAA and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in our systems and services. Additionally, our success may be dependent on the
success of healthcare participants in dealing with HIPAA requirements and the Privacy Standard.

Other Federal and State Laws

.    As a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently
changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be, applicable to our business. Furthermore, our health care service provider
customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us.

Laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects. For example, the confidentiality of patient
medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be released for inclusion in our databases, or released by us to third parties, are subject to substantial regulation by state governments. These state laws and regulations
govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly. In addition, provisions of the Social Security Act prohibit, among other things, paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for
the referral of patients to a person participating in, or for the order, purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by, Medicare, Medicaid and similar other federal or state health care programs. Most states
have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws. These laws are applicable to our financial relationships with, and any marketing or other promotional activities involving, our dental professional customers. Finally,
various states regulate the operation of an advertising and referral service for dentists, and may require registration of such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various



requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists. Violations of any of these laws or
regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we had
approximately 741 employees, approximately 341 of whom were employed in the U.S., 338 in Costa Rica, 44 in Europe, 9 in Latin America, 8 in Asia/Pacific and 1 in the United Arab Emirates, or the U.A.E. As of December 31, 2003, of our U.S. employees,

part of this report.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES.

Our headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California. We lease approximately 90,000 square feet of space where we house our manufacturing, customer support, software engineering and administrative personnel. We
lease our Santa Clara facilities under two leases, both of which expire in 2005. The combined monthly rent for the Santa Clara facilities is approximately $230,000.

We also operate a facility in San Jose, Costa Rica. The main facility comprises approximately 63,000 square feet of
manufacturing and office space. The monthly rent for the Costa Rica facility is approximately $51,000. The lease for this facility expires at the end of 2008.



We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or
substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

On January 6, 2003, Ormco Corporation (“Ormco”) filed suit against us in the United States District Court for the Central District, Orange County Division, asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos.
5,447,432, 5,683,243 and 6,244,861. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. On February 18, 2003, we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity and
non-infringement of the asserted patents. In addition, we counterclaimed for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548, seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. Ormco filed a reply to our counterclaims on March 10, 2003 and
asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548. We responded to Ormco’s counterclaims on April 2, 2003. We amended our counterclaim to add Allesee Orthodontic
Appliances, Inc. (“AOA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ormco, as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548. The Court then permitted Ormco to amend its Complaint and permitted us to amend
our counterclaim to add an additional patent each. Ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 on October 15, 2003. On October 27, 2003, we filed an answer to Ormco’s first amended complaint and a
counterclaim for invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 and for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,554,611.

At a Scheduling Conference held on November 24, 2003, the Court set a June 10, 2004 discovery cutoff and an October 2004 trial date.

Three years ago, Ormco filed suit against us asserting infringement of U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243. In June 2000, the parties entered into a Stipulation of Dismissal with Ormco. Ormco agreed for a period of at least two years not to pursue litigation with respect to these patents, except as set forth below.
Further, Ormco agreed that it would not bring any patent action against us for at least a period of one year with respect to any as yet unissued patents. If Ormco were to bring such an action concerning as yet unissued patents after one year, the
Stipulation of Dismissal would allow Ormco to include in such an action claims involving U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243. In August 2001, Ormco notified us of the issuance of U.S. Patent No. 6,244,861 and offered a license for this patent.
We did not take a license to this patent. Five months after Ormco’s notification, it filed the lawsuit that is currently pending.

The claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243 relate to methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances. The
relevant claims are limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient. The claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,244,861 and 6,616,444
are more generic claims relating to the methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances. Based on the disclosure in the patent, however, the relevant claims also appear to be limited to computerized methods and
algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient. The treatment plan simulation developed in our facilities determines the final positioning of a patient’s
teeth but is not based on a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient.

The claims in our U.S. Patent Nos. 6,398,548 and 6,554,611 relate to methods and systems for incrementally moving teeth using a series of appliances designed to be placed successively on the patient’s teeth.

We strongly believe that Ormco’s claims of infringement
lack merit and that our counterclaim of infringement will be successful. However, the outcome of a lawsuit is inherently unpredictable. Should our technology be found to infringe any one of Ormco’s asserted patents, we would have to seek a
license from Ormco, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In that event, we could be subject to damages or an injunction, which could materially adversely affect our business.



On April 9, 2002, we exercised our right to terminate an Exclusive Marketing Agreement dated October 18,
2001 with Discus Dental Impressions, Inc. (the “Agreement”) pursuant to the express terms of the Agreement and issued a press release reporting this termination. On or about May 14, 2002, we received a demand for arbitration submitted by
Discus Dental with the American Arbitration Association in San Jose, California. In its arbitration demand, Discus Dental sought damages of approximately $30 million, including commissions and bonus payments it claimed it would have allegedly
received under the Agreement as well as other expenses, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief to prevent us from selling Invisalign to dentists in the U.S. and Canada. Based on a review of the factual and legal issues, we denied all claims made
by Discus Dental in its demand and contended that such claims were entirely without merit. In addition, on or about June 13, 2002, we submitted a counter-claim against Discus Dental in the arbitration seeking damages of approximately $40 million
arising out of our claims for misrepresentation, breach of confidentiality provisions, and unfair competition, among others. Three arbitrators were selected (the “Panel”), and the arbitration hearing commenced in San Francisco on August
18, 2003. The parties completed presenting witness testimony on September 9, 2003. The parties completed all post-hearing legal briefing on October 10, 2003, and closing argument was heard on October 29, 2003. At the closing argument before the
Panel, Discus Dental sought lost profit damages of $46.5 million and loss of good will/out of pocket damages of $13.5 million. We voluntarily dismissed our damage counter-claims but maintained our counter-claim for declaratory relief, seeking a
judicial declaration that we properly terminated the Agreement with Discus Dental.

On February 9, 2004, the Panel issued its final arbitration award which concluded the arbitration proceedings initiated by Discus Dental. Under the final arbitration award, Discus Dental is entitled to a judgment in
the amount of $1.00 in damages and reasonable attorney fees and costs in the amount of $2.1 million. In reaching their decision, the arbitrators found that Align’s termination of its marketing agreement with Discus Dental in April of 2002 was
wrongful. We included the $2.1 million charge relating to the final arbitration award in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003.

From time to time, we have received, and may again receive, letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent
rights. While we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention, there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware.

ITEM 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations should be read together with “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

Since our inception in April 1997, we have been engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of Invisalign, a
proprietary system for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. The Invisalign product has two components: ClinCheck

™

and Aligners. ClinCheck

™

is an Internet-based application that allows dental professionals to simulate treatment, in three dimensions, by modeling two-week stages of tooth
movement. Aligners are thin, clear plastic, removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two-week stage of the ClinCheck

™

simulation. Aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental
professionals using ClinCheck

™

.

Two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside
of the U.S. At our facility in Costa Rica, technicians use a sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans, which are transmitted electronically back to the U.S. These electronic files form the
basis of ClinCheck

™

and are used in conjunction
with stereolithography technology to manufacture Aligner molds. A third party manufacturer in Mexico fabricates Aligners from the molds and ships the completed products to our customers.

Revenue from the sale of Invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment, provided that no significant
obligations remain, transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable. The costs of producing the ClinCheck

™

treatment plan, which are incurred prior to the production of Aligners, are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned, i.e. upon shipment
of the Aligners.

In cases where the dental professional elects
to finish the treatment plan using Invisalign, the dental professional orders case refinement. From June 2001 through April 2003, we offered our dental professionals the opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount. The advance
purchase price was non-refundable. Revenue, in the amount of the stand-alone sales price of the undelivered element, is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case refinement or case expiration. In cases where the dental professional did not
purchase case refinements in advance, case refinement revenues are recognized when the new Aligners are shipped.

In May 2003, we updated our domestic pricing policy to include the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer
additional case refinements at a price of $125 each, which we believe represents its fair value based on competitive product offerings. Revenue deferrals associated with future case refinement sales



are $125 per case. This revenue deferral amount represents the fair value of a case refinement as determined in accordance with the newly adopted rules
contained in EITF 00-21, which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services. These revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been utilized or upon case
expiration, which ever is earliest.

Service revenues earned
for training of dental professionals and staff for Invisalign are recorded as the services are performed. Service revenues earned under agreements with third parties are based on negotiated rates, which are intended to approximate a mark-up on our
anticipated costs.

We estimate and record a provision for
amounts of estimated losses on sales, if any, in the period such sales occur. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and
rebates.

We have incurred significant operating losses and
negative operating cash flows since inception and have achieved profitability for the first time in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. As of December 31, 2003, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $300.6 million.

We expect to expend significant capital to continue to build consumer demand,
expand our dental professional channel, automate our manufacturing processes and develop both product and process technology. In November 2002, we completed a private placement of common stock to a group of investors led by existing shareholders,
raising $18.1 million, net of issuance costs. In December 2002, we secured an accounts receivable-based revolving line of credit of up to $10.0 million, and in December 2003 negotiated more favorable terms and increased the line of credit up to $15
million. In December 2002, we also secured an equipment-based term loan of $5.0 million, which was fully drawn down in December 2002. As of December 31, 2003, we had not utilized the accounts receivable-based revolving line of credit. As of December
31, 2003, the equipment-based term loan had an outstanding balance of $3.3 million. Accessing the accounts receivable-based revolving line of credit is restricted based on qualifying accounts receivable and compliance with certain loan covenants.
However, there can be no assurance that such financing will be adequate for us to avoid reducing operating expenses by, among other things, reducing planned capital expenditures relating to enhancing our manufacturing process and reducing worldwide
staff.

Litigation settlement included in general and
administrative expenses.

On April 9, 2002, we exercised our right to terminate an Exclusive Marketing Agreement dated October 18, 2001 with Discus Dental Impressions, Inc. pursuant to the express terms of the Agreement and
issued a press release reporting this termination. On or about May 14, 2002, we received a demand for arbitration submitted by Discus Dental with the American Arbitration Association in San Jose, California. On February 9, 2004, the Panel issued its
final arbitration award which concluded the arbitration proceedings initiated by Discus Dental. Under the final arbitration award, Discus Dental is entitled to a judgment in the amount of $1.00 in damages and attorney fees and costs in the amount of
$2.1 million. In reaching their decision, the arbitrators found that Align’s termination of its marketing agreement with Discus Dental in April of 2002 was wrongful. We included the $2.1 million charge relating to the final arbitration award in
general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003.

In July 2002, we announced a plan to streamline worldwide operations. The plan included closing our facilities in Pakistan and the U.A.E. We transitioned the operations performed at these facilities to the United
States and Costa Rica. For the period ending December 31, 2002, we recorded severance charges of $2.3 million, facility closure charges of $0.9 million, a loss on disposal of fixed assets of $1.1 million and an impairment charge of $0.9 million
related to the land in Pakistan. The land was written down to a zero value to reflect its fair value as estimated by our management. Approximately $0.1 million of accrued charges related to professional fees were included in accrued liabilities as
of December 31, 2002. We discontinued operations at our facilities in Pakistan and the U.A.E in October and December 2002, respectively. We concluded the remainder of indirect operational activities related to the Costa Rica transition in January
2003. We will cease non-operational closing activities in Pakistan when the land is disposed of and in the U.A.E. when the necessary statutory filings have been completed.



Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002:

Revenues.

Revenues for the year ended December
31, 2003 increased 76% to $122.7 million from $69.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenues derived from the sale of Invisalign were $115.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to Invisalign revenues of $63.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in Invisalign revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily the result of an increase in the domestic orthodontic channel of $23.4
million, the domestic general practitioner channel of $22.0 million and the international channel of $6.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2003, growth in the domestic orthodontic and general practitioner channels resulted primarily from an
increase in a growing number of participating clinicians and utilization within their practices. All channels benefited from Invisalign marketing promotion programs conducted during the year ended December 31, 2003. The balance of our revenues
represented sales of training and ancillary products of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Cost of revenues.

Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $51.6 million compared to $45.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002. Cost of revenues include the salaries for staff involved in production, the cost of materials and packaging, shipping costs, depreciation on the capital equipment used in the production process, under/over absorbed
manufacturing capacity, training costs and the cost of facilities. Included in cost of revenues are stock-based compensation expenses of $2.5 million and $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The year ended
December 31, 2002 included restructuring charges of $0.6 million. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $71.2 million or 58% of revenue, compared to a gross profit of $24.7 million or 35% of revenue for the year ended December 31,
2002. The higher gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily attributable to a combination of manufacturing process efficiencies, and improved fixed cost absorption related to increasing volumes. We
believe that the gross profit percentage for fiscal 2004 will continue to improve based on manufacturing process improvements and absorption of costs from higher volumes.

Sales and marketing.

Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were
$43.7 million compared to $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Sales and marketing expenses include sales force compensation (combined with expenses for professional marketing programs), conducting workshops and market surveys,
advertising and attending dental professional trade shows. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 include stock-based compensation expenses of $2.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The decrease in sales and
marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 resulted primarily from a decrease in spending of $2.3 million for international media and advertising and $1.7 million related to our
restructuring of and reductions in our international sales and marketing work force. The year ended December 31, 2002 included restructuring charges of $1.2 million and no restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2003. The reduction of
the international sales and marketing work force in fiscal 2003 and the restructuring charges in fiscal 2002 were part of the plan during the second half of fiscal 2002 to streamline worldwide operations. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 were partially offset by an increase in spending of $3.9 million related to incremental headcount in our North American sales force and $0.5 million in incremental
media and advertisement costs for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase as we invest more on clinical education, direct-to-consumer mail advertising and
related consumer spending.

General and
administrative.

General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $34.3 million compared to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. General and administrative expenses included
salaries for administrative personnel, outside consulting services, legal expenses and general corporate expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 include stock-based compensation expenses of $7.1
million and $10.7 million, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended



December 31, 2002 resulted primarily from a decrease in stock-based compensation of $3.6 million. Salary expense decreased in fiscal 2003 by $2.5 million
related to reductions in the North American and international administrative work forces and restructuring charges decreased by $2.9 million to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2002. Additionally, depreciation, amortization and overhead expenses also decreased by approximately $3.4 million in fiscal 2003. Partially offsetting the decreases in spending were increases of $1.7 million in outside consultant costs and $3.6
million in incremental legal expenses related our litigation matters. Also offsetting the overall decrease in spending was a litigation settlement charge of $2.1 million included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31,
2003 related to the conclusion of the Discus arbitration proceedings.

Research and development.

Research and development expenses for both the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $13.1 million. Research and development expenses included the costs associated with software
engineering, the cost of designing, developing and testing our products and conducting clinical and post-marketing trials. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses included $3.2 million of
stock-based compensation for both the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For the full year 2004, we expect to increase research and development spending for clinical research and product improvement initiatives.

Interest and other income (expense),
net.

Interest and other income (expense) was ($0.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest and other expenses increased by $0.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest income decreased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to lower interest rates paid on cash,
cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Included in other expense is foreign currency translation gain, which increased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002.

Stock-based compensation.

In connection with
the grant of stock options to employees and non-employees prior to 2001, we recorded deferred stock-based compensation as a component of stockholders’ equity. Deferred stock-based compensation for options granted to employees is the difference
between the fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price. For stock options granted to non-employees, the fair value of the options, estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, is initially
recorded on the date of grant. As the non-employee options vest, we revalue the remaining unvested options, with the change in fair value from period to period represented as a change in deferred compensation. This stock-based compensation is
amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options. For the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of $12.8 million and $16.0 million, respectively. Additionally, we recorded
expenses of $1.3 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to options granted to non-employees.

We have accelerated the vesting of options to several employees in connection with severance packages. This acceleration was accounted for as a charge to
the consolidated statements of operations. We recorded charges of $1.0 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Each respective charge is equal to the intrinsic value difference between the exercise
price of the accelerated options and the fair value of the common stock on the date of acceleration.

Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001:

Revenues

.    Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 56% to $69.7 million compared to $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Revenues of $63.7 million were
derived from the sale of Invisalign compared to revenues of $43.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in Invisalign revenues was primarily due to an increase in the domestic orthodontic channel of $6.2
million, the domestic general practitioner channel of $9.5 million and the international channel of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 over the year ended December 31, 2001. The balance of our revenues



represented sales of ancillary products and other services of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $1.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2001, with the increase primarily attributable to training.

Cost of revenues

.    Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $45.0 million compared to $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Cost of revenues include the salaries for staff involved
in production, the cost of materials and packaging, shipping costs, depreciation on the capital equipment used in the production process, under/over absorbed manufacturing capacity, training costs and the cost of facilities. Also included in cost of
revenues are stock based compensation expenses of $3.4 million and $4.6 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and $0.6 million of restructuring charges incurred as part of our July 2002 plan to streamline worldwide operations. Gross margin for the
year ended December 31, 2002 was $24.7 million or 35% of revenue, compared with a negative gross margin of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. We achieved positive gross margins in 2002 and the second half of 2001 mainly due to
efficiencies in manufacturing as well as increased production volumes. Our gross margin is affected by changes in manufacturing volume, manufacturing capacity and changes in our average selling price.

Sales and marketing

.    Sales and marketing
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $45.3 million compared to $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Sales and marketing expenses include sales force compensation together with expenses for professional marketing,
conducting training workshops and market surveys, advertising and attending dental professional trade shows. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 resulted primarily from reduced spending in North America
for media and advertising by approximately $13.2 million and reduced spending of direct mail advertising by approximately $1.6 million, partially offset by an increase in spending of $1.6 million related to incremental headcount in our North
American sales force. Also offsetting spending reductions was an increase in spending at our international locations by approximately $5.7 million primarily in the first two quarters of fiscal 2002. Also included in sales and marketing expenses are
stock based compensation expenses of $2.9 million and $3.9 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and $1.2 million of restructuring charges related to severance incurred as part of our July 2002 plan to streamline worldwide operations.

General and administrative

.    General and
administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $39.3 million compared to $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. General and administrative expenses include salaries for administrative personnel, outside consulting
services, facilities, legal expenses and general corporate expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 resulted primarily from expanding support infrastructure, at our international locations,
primarily during the first two quarters of fiscal 2002. Included in general and administrative expenses in 2002 were $3.4 million of restructuring charges due to severance charges of $0.5 million, facility closure charges of $0.9 million, a loss on
disposal of fixed assets of $1.1 million and an impairment charge of $0.9 million related to the land in Pakistan, incurred as part of our July 2002 plan to streamline worldwide operations.

Research and development

.    Research and
development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $13.1 million compared to $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Research and development expenses include the costs associated with software engineering, designing,
developing and testing our products and conducting clinical and post-marketing trials. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. The decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 was
primarily due to a decrease in outside consulting services of approximately $1.2 million and a decrease in headcount expense related to product development activities of approximately $1.5 million. Research and development expenses for 2002 also
included $0.1 million of restructuring charges incurred as part of our July 2002 plan to streamline worldwide operations, and $3.2 million and $4.1 million of stock based compensation expense for 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Interest and other income (expense),
net

.    Interest and other income was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Interest income decreased in fiscal 2002 by $3.3 million primarily due to
the decrease in our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities



balances. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily generated from our cash and cash equivalents balance and investments in
short-term marketable securities. Other expenses increased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. Offsetting the overall decreases in interest and other income (expense) was a charge of
$1.8 million in the first quarter of 2001 for non-cash interest expense, related to the beneficial conversion feature embedded in convertible subordinated notes.

Dividend related to beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock

.    In 2000 we issued
9,535,052 shares of Series D preferred stock which were subject to an antidilution conversion price adjustment feature. We triggered this antidilution conversion price adjustment feature when we granted options to purchase our common stock beyond
the number of options that were authorized under our 1997 Plan at the time we commenced our Series D preferred stock offering in May 2000. The conversion feature provided that if, during the period between May 12, 2000 (the commitment date for our
Series D preferred stock offering) and the earlier of the closing of an initial public offering or January 31, 2001, we had granted more than an aggregate of 3,331,978 options to purchase our common stock, then the conversion price of our Series D
preferred stock would be adjusted downward from its original conversion price of $10.625 per share. As of the end of January 2001, we had granted an aggregate of 3,591,458 options to purchase shares of our common stock in excess of the 3,331,978
options permitted. As a result we were required to issue an additional 790,342 shares of common stock upon the conversion of the Series D preferred stock. These shares were in addition to the 419,700 additional shares of common stock that we were
required to issue upon conversion of the Series D preferred stock as of December 31, 2000. As a result, we recorded a deemed dividend for the year ended December 31, 2001 based on the fair value of the common stock. We also recorded at the
commitment date of the Series D preferred stock offering $11.2 million related to the preferred stock sold and a charge to interest expense of $1.8 million for the beneficial conversion feature embedded in convertible subordinated notes that were
previously converted. In 2002, we had no issued and outstanding preferred stock, and in 2002 we did not record any deemed dividends related to preferred stock.

Stock-based compensation

.    In connection with the grant of stock options to employees and non-employees, we recorded
deferred stock-based compensation as a component of stockholders’ equity. Deferred stock-based compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and
their exercise price. For stock options granted to non-employees, the fair value of the options, estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, is initially recorded on the date of grant. As the non-employee options become exercisable, we
revalue the remaining unvested options, with the change in fair value from period to period represented as a change in the deferred compensation charge. This stock-based compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of
the options. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of $16.0 million and $22.2 million, respectively. Additionally, we recorded expenses of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
related to options granted to non-employees.

We accelerated
the vesting of options to several employees in connection with severance packages. This acceleration was accounted for as a charge to the consolidated statements of operations. The charge for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were recorded
as $2.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The charge is equal to the intrinsic value difference between the exercise price of the accelerated options and the fair value of the common stock on the date of acceleration.

Income Taxes

We have incurred immaterial amounts of income tax expense to date since we have not been profitable on an annual basis in
either our domestic or international operations. As of December 31, 2003, we have aggregate federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $238.9 million. As of December 31, 2003 we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing
net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization. We have aggregate federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of $4.1 million as of December 31, 2003.



The federal research credit carryforwards expire beginning in the year 2017, if not utilized. The state research credit carryforward does not expire. The
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in the year 2017 for federal and 2005 for state purposes, if not utilized. Utilization of the federal net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited by the change of
ownership provisions contained in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically,
we have funded our operations with the proceeds from the sale of our common and preferred stock, an equipment-based term loan and bridge loans. As of December 31, 2003, we had $44.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $0.4 million of restricted
cash and $2.3 million of short-term marketable securities. We had an accumulated deficit of $300.6 million as of December 31, 2003.

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities totaled $12.1 million and ($40.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted primarily from cash collections from customers, increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net
cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from operating losses and increases in accounts receivable balances in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and net cash provided by investing activities totaled $1.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the purchase of property and equipment for capacity expansion in Costa Rica. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, net cash provided by investing activities resulted primarily from the maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by the purchases of property and equipment.

Net cash provided by financing activities were $1.6 million and $23.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. For both the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by payments on debt obligations. In November 2002, we
completed a private placement of 9,578,944 shares common stock to a group of investors led by existing shareholders, raising $18.1 million, net of issuance costs. In December 2002, we accessed a $5.0 million equipment-based term loan, and the
balance of the loan as of December 31, 2003 was $3.3 million.

Contractual Obligations

The impact that our
contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:

(1)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments.



We expect that our operating expenses will increase commensurate with an overall increase in the level of
our business activity, including increased sales and the related costs of products sold, our consumer advertising campaign and dental professional marketing efforts, continuing efforts to automate our manufacturing processes, increases in the size
of our sales force and dental professional training staff, continued international sales and marketing efforts, and development and improvements to our product. In addition, we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or
technologies. Our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market, sell and support our products on a worldwide basis. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our
operations for at least the next 12 months. If we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows, we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with other companies,
bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds
are not available, we could be required to delay establishing a national brand, building manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology, or to reduce our expenditures in general. Accordingly, the failure to obtain
sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Critical Accounting Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, legal contingencies and income
taxes. We use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in
accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and EITF 00-21. SAB No. 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery
has occurred or services have been rendered; the fee is fixed and determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered are based on management’s judgments based on whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. EITF 00-21 addresses the
issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services. Should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any
reporting period could be adversely affected.

Revenue from the
sale of Invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment, provided that no significant obligations remain, transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable. The costs of producing the
ClinCheck

™

treatment plan, which are incurred prior to the production of Aligners, are
deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned, i.e. upon shipment of the Aligners.

In cases where the dental professional elects to finish the treatment plan using Invisalign, the dental professional orders case refinement. From June 2001 through April 2003, we offered our dental professionals the
opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount. The advance purchase price was non-



refundable. Revenue, in the amount of the stand-alone sales price of the undelivered element, is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case
refinement or case expiration. In cases where the dental professional did not purchase case refinement in advance, case refinement revenues are recognized when the new Aligners are shipped.

In May 2003, we updated our domestic pricing policy to include the future
delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer additional case refinements at a price of $125 each, which we believe represents its fair value based on competitive product offerings. Revenue deferrals associated with future
case refinement after May 1, 2003 are $125 per case. This revenue deferral amount represents the fair value of a case refinement as determined in accordance with EITF 00-21, which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the
delivery of multiple products or services. These revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been utilized or upon case expiration, which ever is earliest.

Service revenues earned for training of dental professionals and staff for Invisalign are recorded as the services are
performed. Service revenues earned under agreements with third parties are based on negotiated rates, which are intended to approximate a mark-up on our anticipated costs.

We estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales, if any, in the period such sales occur.
Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates.

Warranty Expense

The Company generally warrants its products for a specific period of time against material defects. The Company provides for the estimated future costs of
warranty obligations in costs of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized. The accrued warranty costs represents the best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that the Company expects to incur to repair or replace product which
fails while still under warranty. The amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the
accrued balances and updates the historical warranty cost trends. Actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued.

Aligners are subject to the Invisalign product warranty, which covers defects in materials and workmanship. Our materials and workmanship warranty is in
force until the Invisalign case is completed. In the event the Aligners fall within the scope of the Invisalign product warranty, we will replace the Aligners at our expense. Our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the Aligners for the
purposes for which they are intended. If a patient chooses not to wear the Aligners, and as a result, requests additional Invisalign treatment, the dental professional pays for the additional expense. The Invisalign product warranty does not provide
any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using Invisalign.

We accrue for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products. Actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued. Our warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered defective or fail
to meet the product specifications.

The amount of accrued
estimated warranty costs is primarily based on our historical experience with product failures as well as current information on replacement costs. Actual warranty costs could differ from the estimate amounts. On a quarterly basis, we review the
accrued balances and update the historical warranty cost trends. If we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future, it would negatively affect operating results.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
payments. We periodically review these estimated allowances, including an analysis of the customers’ payment history and information regarding the customers’ creditworthiness. If the financial condition of any of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, an additional allowance may be required and would negatively impact our operating results.



Accounting for long-lived assets

We assess the impairment of long-lived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” An impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an
impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall
business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant decline in the stock price for a sustained period and the market capitalization relative to net book value. If these factors or their related assumptions change in the future,
we may be required to record impairment charges which would negatively impact operating results.

Legal contingencies

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Because of uncertainties related
to both the potential amount and range of loss from pending litigation, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result if there is an unfavorable outcome in these legal proceedings. As additional information
becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to this pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly. Revisions of our estimates of such potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial
condition.

Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance

We have established a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax
assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.

While we have considered potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent
and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance, in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would
increase net income in the period such determination was made.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and
for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of FAS 149 did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how companies classify and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires companies to classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). SFAS No. 150 is effective beginning second quarter of fiscal 2004.
We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 150 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.



RISK FACTORS

The statements contained below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K that are not purely historical are
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, without limitation, statements regarding our expectations, hopes,
beliefs, anticipations, commitments, intentions and strategies regarding the future. Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements for the reasons, among others, detailed below. The fact that some of the risk
factors may be the same or similar to our past filings means only that the risks are present in multiple periods. We believe that many of the risks detailed here are part of doing business in the industry in which we compete and will likely be
present in all periods reported. The fact that certain risks are characteristic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we assume no
obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

The operating losses and negative cash flows we have experienced in the past may continue throughout fiscal 2004 and we may not achieve
or maintain profitability in the future.

You should
consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by a company in an early stage of operations. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and we have only achieved profitability
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. From inception through July 2000, we spent significant funds on organizational and start-up activities, recruiting key managers and employees, developing Invisalign and developing our manufacturing and
customer support resources. We also spent significant funds on clinical trials and training programs to train dental professionals in the use of Invisalign.

We continue to incur significant operating expenses to:

•

develop new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing processes;

•

execute our consumer advertising campaign and dental professional marketing efforts;

•

increase the size of our sales force and clinical education support staff;

•

execute clinical research and education plans;

•

develop technological improvements to our products;

•

continue our international sales and marketing efforts; and

•

undertake quality assurance and improvement initiatives.

As a result, we will need to increase our revenue significantly, while controlling our expenses, to achieve profitability. Only recently, beginning in the
third quarter of fiscal 2003, have we generated positive cash flow from operations, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase such positive cash flow from operations, from period to period, in the future. It is possible
that we will not achieve profitability in the future, and even if we do achieve profitability in future periods, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in future periods.

We have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to fluctuate which may cause volatility in our stock price.

We were incorporated in April 1997 and began sales of
Invisalign in July 1999. Thus, we have a limited operating history, which makes an evaluation of our future prospects and your investment in our stock difficult. In addition, we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate
as we increase our commercial sales. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. Some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include:

•

changes in the timing of product orders;



•

unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity, any disruptions in the manufacturing process or the introduction of new production processes;

•

inaccurate forecasting of revenue, production and other operating costs; and

•

the development and marketing of directly competitive products by potential competitors.

To respond to these and other factors, we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating
results. Most of our expenses, such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations, are relatively fixed in the short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if
our revenue for a particular period falls below our expectations, we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in revenue levels.

Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.

We have limited product offerings, and if demand for Invisalign declines or fails to develop as we expect, our revenue will decline.

We expect that revenue from the sale of Invisalign will continue to account
for a substantial portion of our total revenue. Continued and widespread market acceptance of Invisalign is critical to our future success. Invisalign may not achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect, or at all, which could reduce
our revenue and results of operations.

If dental professionals do not adopt
Invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate, our operating results will be harmed.

Our success depends upon increasing acceptance of Invisalign by dental professionals. Invisalign requires dental professionals and their staff to undergo
special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways. In addition, because Invisalign has only been in clinical testing since July 1997 and commercially available only since July 1999, dental professionals may be reluctant to adopt it
until more historical clinical results are available. Also, increasing adoption and cumulative use by dental professionals will depend on factors such as the capability, safety, efficacy, ease of use, price, quality and reliability of our products
and our provision of effective sales support, training and service. In the future, unanticipated poor clinical performance of Invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and, consequently, reduced acceptance by dental professionals. If
Invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the orthodontic and dental communities, our operating results will be harmed.

If consumers do not adopt Invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate, our operating results will be harmed.

Invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic
treatment, and patients may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to conventional treatment. In addition, patients may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines for Invisalign, which could compromise the effectiveness of
their treatment. We have generally received positive feedback from both dental professionals and patients regarding Invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion, but a number of dental
professionals believe that Invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients. Our success will depend upon the acceptance of Invisalign by a substantially larger number of dental professionals and potential patients to whom
we are now actively marketing. We have had a limited number of complaints from patients and prospective patients generally related to shipping delays and minor manufacturing irregularities. Market acceptance will depend in part upon the
recommendations of dental professionals, as well



as other factors including effectiveness, safety, reliability, improved treatment aesthetics and greater comfort and hygiene compared to conventional
orthodontic products. Furthermore, consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience. Adoption by consumers may also be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions, including the
economic downturn and increased unemployment levels in the United States of America, levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending, all of which fluctuate and could be affected by unstable global economic, political or other conditions. If
orthodontists and dentists experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services or consumers prove unwilling to adopt Invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate, our operating results will be harmed.

We are dependent on our international manufacturing operations, which
exposes us to foreign operational, political and other risks that may harm our business.

Currently, two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the U.S. At our facility in Costa Rica, technicians use a sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program to
prepare electronic treatment plans, which are transmitted electronically back to the U.S. These electronic files form the basis of our ClinCheck

™

product and are used to manufacture Aligner molds. A third party manufacturer in Mexico fabricates Aligners and ships the completed products to our
customers. Our costs associated with these operations are denominated in Costa Rican colons, Mexican pesos and U.S. dollars.

Our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation, including:

•

political, social and economic instability;

•

acts of terrorism and acts of war;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

•

controlling quality of the manufacturing process;

•

interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services;

•

product or material transportation delays or disruption;

•

burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws;

•

trade restrictions and changes in tariffs;

•

import and export license requirements and restrictions;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and

•

potential adverse tax consequences.

If any of these risks materialize in the future, our operating results may be harmed.

Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights,
our competitive position may be harmed.

Our success will
depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products, both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our inability to do so could harm our competitive
position. We believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage. As of December 31, 2003, we had 41 issued U.S. patents, 73 pending U.S. patent applications, and numerous foreign issued patents, as well as pending
foreign patent applications.

We intend to rely on our
portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position. However, our currently



pending or future patent filings may not issue as patents. Additionally, any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable,
circumvented, or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products. In addition, any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under U.S.
patents and intellectual property laws. We also rely on protection of our copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and our collaborative
partners upon commencement of a relationship with us. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information, and adequate remedies may not
exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur. Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents, copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect
on our operating results, financial condition and future growth prospects. In particular, a failure of our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology, which could adversely affect pricing and market share.

If we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a
patent infringement claim, our ability to grow our business will be severely limited.

Extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry. We have been sued for infringement of another party’s patent in the past and, while that action
has been dismissed, we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future.

On January 6, 2003, Ormco Corporation filed suit against us in the United States District Court for the Central District, Orange County Division, asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432, 5,683,243 and
6,244,861. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. On February 18, 2003, we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity and non-infringement of the asserted
patents. In addition, we counterclaimed for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548, seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. Ormco filed a reply to our counterclaims on March 10, 2003 and asserted counterclaims against us
seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548. We responded to Ormco’s counterclaims on April 2, 2003. We amended our counterclaim to add Allesee Orthodontic Appliances, Inc.
(“AOA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ormco, as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548. The Court then permitted Ormco to amend its Complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim
to add an additional patent each. Ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 on October 15, 2003. On October 27, 2003, we filed an answer to Ormco’s first amended complaint and a counterclaim for
invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 and for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,554,611.

At a Scheduling Conference held on November 24, 2003, the Court set a June 10, 2004 discovery cutoff and an October 2004 trial date.

Three years ago, Ormco filed suit against us asserting infringement of U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243. In June 2000, the parties entered into a Stipulation of Dismissal with Ormco. Ormco agreed for a period of at least two years not to pursue litigation with respect to these patents, except as set forth below.
Further, Ormco agreed that it would not bring any patent action against us for at least a period of one year with respect to any as yet unissued patents. If Ormco were to bring such an action concerning as yet unissued patents after one year, the
Stipulation of Dismissal would allow Ormco to include in such an action claims involving U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243. In August 2001, Ormco notified us of the issuance of U.S. Patent No. 6,244,861 and offered a license for this patent.
We did not take a license to this patent. Five months after Ormco’s notification, it filed the lawsuit that is currently pending.

The claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243 relate to methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances. The
relevant claims are limited to computerized methods and



algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient. The claims in U.S.
Patent Nos. 6,244,861 and 6,616,444 are more generic claims relating to the methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances. Based on the disclosure in the patent, however, the relevant claims also appear to be
limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient. The treatment plan simulation developed in our facilities determines the
final positioning of a patient’s teeth but is not based on a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient.

The claims in our U.S. Patent Nos. 6,398,548 and 6,554,611 relate to methods and systems for incrementally moving teeth using a series of appliances
designed to be placed successively on the patient’s teeth.

We strongly believe that Ormco’s claims of infringement lack merit and that our counterclaim of infringement will be successful. However, the outcome of a lawsuit is inherently unpredictable. Should our technology be found to infringe
any one of Ormco’s asserted patents, we would have to seek a license from Ormco, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In that event, we could be subject to damages or an injunction, which could materially
adversely affect our business.

From time to time, we have
received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. While we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention, there may be
other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and
significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination in a patent suit by Ormco or in any other litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant
liabilities. An adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties. Licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or
at all, in which event, our business would be materially adversely affected.

Pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition.

We are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims. Management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and
claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in
cases where injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of
that period or future periods.

We currently rely on third parties to
provide key inputs to our manufacturing process, and if our access to these inputs is diminished, our business may be harmed.

We currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process. We rely on a third party manufacturer in Mexico to fabricate Aligners and to ship the
completed product to customers. As a result, if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services, we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed. This third party
manufacturer was recently acquired by a larger company in its industry. Any difficulties encountered by the acquiring company with respect to assimilating personnel and operations, and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards, controls,
procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner. Finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive, time-consuming or impossible.



In addition, we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment, rapid
prototyping machines, resin and other advanced materials. We maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies. Our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed
equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth. In the event of delivery delays or shortages of these items, our business and growth prospects may be harmed.

We have experienced rapid growth, and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business.

We have expanded rapidly since we commenced commercial sales in 1999. Our
headcount increased from approximately 50 employees as of September 30, 1999 to approximately 741 employees as of December 31, 2003. This expansion will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us
to continue to develop and improve our operational, financial and other internal controls, both in the U.S. and internationally. In particular, rapid growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas, including recruiting and retaining
sufficient skilled personnel, providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards, and preserving our culture and values. Our inability to effectively manage this level of growth could harm our business.

If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may be
unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products.

We are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering, technology development and management teams. The loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product
development and other business objectives and could harm our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, recruit, train and retain additional qualified personnel. In addition, few orthodontists are accustomed to working
in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices, universities and other research institutions. Thus, we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the
further development of our business. Furthermore, we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially harmed.

We experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive
competition in the future.

Currently, our Invisalign
product competes directly against a product called Red, White and Blue, which is manufactured and distributed by Ormco, a subsidiary of Sybron Dental Specialties. In addition, manufacturers of traditional braces, such as 3M Company, Sybron Dental
Specialties and Dentsply International have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may, in the future, attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours. Large consumer product
companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market. Furthermore, we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies. We may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these
competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by our competitors, our business could be harmed.

We may be unable to raise additional capital if it should be necessary,
which could harm our ability to compete.

We have incurred
significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have achieved profitability for the first time in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. As of December 31, 2003, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $300.6
million.



We expect to expend significant capital to continue to build our national brand, expand our dental
professional channels, automate our manufacturing processes and develop both product and process technology. In November 2002, we completed a private placement of common stock to a group of investors led by existing stockholders, raising $18.1
million, net of issuance costs. In December 2002, we secured an accounts receivable-based revolving line of credit of up to $10.0 million, and in December 2003 negotiated more favorable terms and increased the line of credit up to $15 million. In
December 2002, we also secured an equipment-based term loan of $5.0 million, which was fully drawn down in December 2002. As of December 31, 2003, we had not utilized the accounts receivable-based revolving line of credit. Accessing the accounts
receivable-based revolving line of credit is restricted based on qualifying accounts receivable and compliance with customary loan covenants. There can be no assurance that such financing will be adequate for us to avoid reducing operating expenses
by, among other things, reducing planned capital expenditures relating to enhancing our manufacturing process and reducing worldwide staff.

Complying with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulations is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in
substantial penalties.

Our products are medical devices
and are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and internationally. FDA regulations are wide ranging and govern, among other things:

•

product design, development, manufacture and testing;

•

product labeling;

•

product storage;

•

pre-market clearance or approval;

•

advertising and promotion; and

•

product sales and distribution.

Noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action which may include recalling products, ceasing product marketing,
and paying significant fines and penalties. One or more of these enforcement actions could limit product sales, delay product shipment and adversely affect our profitability.

We must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the FDA and adhere to applicable Quality
System regulations. The FDA enforces its Quality System regulations through periodic unannounced inspections, which we have yet to undergo. If we or any third party manufacturer of our products do not conform to applicable Quality System
regulations, we may be required to find alternative manufacturers, which could be a long and costly process.

Before we can sell a new medical device in the U.S., we must obtain FDA clearance or approval, which can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. Even
though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the FDA through the pre-market notification provisions of Section 510(k) of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, we may be unable to maintain the necessary clearances in
the future. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we market in the future. Our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business.

If the security of our customer and patient information is compromised, patient care could
suffer, we could be liable for related damages, and our reputation could be impaired.

We retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers. Therefore, it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are
perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure. Despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or



similar disruptive problems. If we fail to meet our clients’ expectations, we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired. In
addition, patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner. Our insurance may not protect us from this risk.

If compliance with government regulations of healthcare becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us, we may not be able to
grow our business.

Participants in the healthcare
industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be, applicable to our business.
Furthermore, our healthcare service provider, payor and plan customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us.

The healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing
political, economic and regulatory influences. Regulations implemented pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may require us to make unplanned enhancements of software applications or services, result in delays
or cancellations of orders, or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants. The affect of HIPAA on our business is difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will adequately
address the business risks created by HIPAA and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities.

Extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties.

In addition to medical device laws and regulations,
numerous state and federal healthcare-related laws regulate our business, covering areas such as:

•

storage, transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records;

•

prohibitions against the offer, payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods; and

•

the marketing and advertising of our products.

Complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time-consuming, and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of
our sales and marketing activities or our revenues.

We face risks related
to our international sales, including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals.

Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. The time required to
obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and requirements for such approvals may differ from FDA requirements. We may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one
or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future. We may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals. If we experience delays in receipt of
approvals to market our products outside of the U.S., or if we fail to receive these approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner, if at all. We currently sell our products in Europe,
Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Brazil, Australia and Hong Kong, and may expand into other countries from time to time. We do not know whether orthodontists, dentists and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt Invisalign in sufficient
numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate.



Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims, and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject
to product liability claims or litigation.

Medical
devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. We may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found
unsuitable. Although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance, adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. A product liability
claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs. These costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business, and
could harm our business.

In fiscal 2003, the market price for our common
stock was highly volatile. Although the market price for our common stock has increased during fiscal 2003, the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our
control.

The factors include:

•

quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity;

•

changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results;

•

speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations;

•

strategic actions by our competitors, such as product announcements or acquisitions; and

•

announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our customers or competitors; and general market conditions.

In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology and
medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may
seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company’s securities. If a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future, we would incur substantial legal fees, and our management’s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to
respond to the litigation.

Future sales of significant amounts of our
common stock may depress our stock price.

A large
percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders. These stockholders have sold in the past, and may sell in the future, large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time.
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business. In
addition, certain of our current stockholders have registration rights in connection with a private placement sale of approximately 9.6 million shares of our common stock that occurred in November 2002. As a result of these registration rights, we
were required to file a registration statement under the Securities Act at our expense to register the securities sold in the November 2002 private placement. We filed this registration statement with the SEC on October 17, 2003 and it was declared
effective by the SEC on November 20, 2003. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell
securities in the future at a time and at a price we deem appropriate.



Concentrations of ownership and agreements among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders
may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate transactions.

The interests of our management could conflict with those of our other stockholders. As of December 31, 2003, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of
approximately 50.7% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, if acting together, would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant
corporate transactions. This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us, which in turn could reduce the market price of our stock.



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Quantitative Disclosures

We are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations, primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk. These risks arise from transactions
and operations entered into in the normal course of business. We do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our marketable securities or our debt instruments. We have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments.

Interest Rate Risk

.    We are
subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale marketable securities, existing long-term debts and any future financing requirements. Interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by monitoring
maturities in our marketable securities portfolio. Our long-term debt at December 31, 2003 consists of outstanding balances on capital lease obligations of $0.5 million and a $3.3 million equipment-based term loan.

The fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be
significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the marketable securities maturities do not exceed fiscal year 2004 and the interest rates are primarily fixed. Our capital lease obligations of $0.5 million at December 31, 2003 carry fixed
interest rates of 6.53% and 11.15% per annum, with principal payments due in 60 and 48 monthly installments, respectively, which began in 2000.

In December 2002, we obtained a $5.0 million equipment-based term loan which accrues interest at a rate of 2.25% above prime. In December 2002 we had
drawn down $5.0 million from the equipment-based term loan. Principal payments are due in 36 monthly installments which began in January 2003.

The following table presents the future principal cash flows or amounts and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash
and cash equivalents, marketable securities and long-term debt instruments:

Qualitative Disclosures

Interest Rate Risk

.    Our
primary interest rate risk exposures relate to:

•

A decrease in the value of available-for-sale securities if market interest rates increase;

•

Our ability to pay long-term debts at maturity; and

•

The impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations.

We have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income
investments until maturity. As a result, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short- and long-term marketable securities portfolio.



We manage interest rate risk on our outstanding long-term debts through the use of fixed rate debt.
Management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis.

Currency Rate Risk

.    Our primary currency rate risk exposures relate to:

•

Our decentralized or outsourced operations, whereby approximately $15.4 million of our annual expenses are related to operations outside the United States, denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar.

We do not hedge any
balance sheet exposures or intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates. The exposure related to currency rate movements would not likely have a material impact on future net income or cash flows for the foreseeable
future.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1    Organization

Formation and business of the Company

The Company was incorporated in April 1997 and is engaged in the
development, manufacturing and marketing of Invisalign, used for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign uses a series of clear plastic “Aligners” to move the patients’ teeth in small increments from their
original state to a final treated state. The Company exited the development stage in July 2000.

Note 2    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from those estimates.

Fair value of financial instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate the fair value. The carrying value of marketable securities approximates their fair value as determined by market quotes. Based on borrowing rates currently available to
the Company for debt with similar terms, the carrying value of its debt obligations approximates fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company invests primarily in money market funds and commercial paper, accordingly, these investments are subject to minimal credit and market risks.

Restricted cash

The Company’s restricted cash as of December 31, 2003 of $439,000 was
primarily comprised of security against leasing arrangements in Europe. The Company’s restricted cash as of December 31, 2002 was primarily comprised of $3,000,000, which represented the minimum deposit requirement in connection with the
Company’s revolving line of credit and equipment loan facility with Comerica Bank (see note 7). The minimum deposit requirement for the Comerica loan facility was removed from the loan agreement in December 2003.

Short- and long-term marketable securities

Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried
at fair value. Marketable securities classified as current assets have scheduled maturities of less than one year, while marketable securities classified



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

as non-current assets have scheduled maturities of more than one year. Unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in earnings and computed using the specific identification cost method. Realized gains or losses and charges for
other-than-temporary declines in value, if any, on available-for-sale securities are reported in other income or expense as incurred. The Company periodically evaluates these investments for other-than-temporary impairment.

Certain risks and uncertainties

The Company’s operating results depend to a significant extent on the
Company’s ability to market and develop its products. The life cycles of the Company’s products are difficult to estimate due in part to the effect of future product enhancements and competition. The inability of the Company to
successfully develop and market its products as a result of competition or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company invests excess cash primarily in money market funds of major financial institutions, commercial paper and notes. The Company provides credit to customers in
the normal course of business. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable, but ongoing evaluations of customers’ credit worthiness are performed. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been
within management’s expectations. No individual customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s accounts receivable at December 31, 2003 and 2002, or net revenues in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001.

In the United States of America, the Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) regulates the design, manufacture, distribution, preclinical and clinical study, clearance and approval of medical devices. Products developed by the Company may require approvals or clearances from the FDA or other international
regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales. There can be no assurance that the Company’s products will receive any of the required approvals or clearances. If the Company was denied approval or clearance or such approval was delayed, it
may have a material adverse impact on the Company.

The Company
has manufacturing operations located outside the United States of America. The Company currently relies on its manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica to create virtual treatment plans with the assistance of sophisticated software. In addition, the
Company relies on third party manufacturers in Mexico to fabricate Aligners and to ship the completed product to the Company’s customers. The Company’s reliance on international operations exposes it to related risks and uncertainties,
including; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; controlling quality of manufacture; political, social and economic instability; interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services; product and/or material
transportation delays or disruption; trade restrictions and changes in tariffs; import and export license requirements and restrictions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and potential adverse tax consequences. If any of these risks
materialize, the Company’s international manufacturing operations, as well as its operating results, may be harmed.

The Company receives certain of its components from sole suppliers. Additionally, the Company relies on a limited number of hardware manufacturers. The
inability of any supplier or manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could materially impact future operating results.



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company records
provisions to write down its inventory and related purchase commitments for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about the
future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company estimates, additional inventory provisions may be required.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are: three years for computer software and hardware and five years for plant equipment, furniture, fixtures and equipment. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. Upon sale or retirement, the asset’s cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
any related gain or loss is reflected in operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

Development costs for internal use software and web-site development

Website development and related costs consist of external and internal costs incurred to purchase and implement the website
software and significant enhancements used in the Company’s business. Costs incurred in the development of application and infrastructure of the website are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the website. During fiscal
2002, the Company re-engineered its website, and previously capitalized costs of $392,000 were written off. Website development costs of $103,000 had been capitalized as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. Amortization of website development costs
commenced upon launch of the website. Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 amounted to $74,000 and $40,000, respectively.

Internal and external costs of designing, creating and maintaining website content, graphics and user interface on the web site are expensed as incurred.

There was other software developed for internal use and
capitalized as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 in the amount of $1,099,000 and $1,124,000, respectively. Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 amounted to $369,000 and $192,000 respectively.

Impairment of long-lived assets

The Company identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived assets
used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the assets carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value, as measured by the discounted future cash flows.

Product Warranty

The Company generally warrants its products for a specific period of time
against material defects. The Company provides for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in costs of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized. The accrued warranty costs represents the best estimate at the time of sale of the
total



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

costs that the Company expects to incur to repair or replace product which fails while still under warranty. The amount of accrued estimated warranty costs
are primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the accrued balances and updates the historical warranty cost trends. Actual warranty costs
incurred have not materially differed from those accrued.

Aligners are subject to the Invisalign product warranty, which covers defects in materials and workmanship. Our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the Invisalign case in completed. In the event the Aligners fall within the
scope of the Invisalign product warranty, we will replace the Aligners at our expense. Our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the Aligners for the purposes for which they are intended. If a patient chooses not to wear the Aligners, and as a
result, requests additional Invisalign treatment, the dental professional pays for the additional expense. The Invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using Invisalign.

The following table reflects the change in the Company’s warranty
accrual during the year ended December 31, 2003.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from the sale of Invisalign and ancillary
products is recognized upon product shipment, provided that no significant obligations remain, transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable. The costs of producing the ClinCheck

™

treatment plan, which are incurred prior to the production of Aligners, are
deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned, i.e. upon shipment of the Aligners.

In cases where the dental professional elects to finish the treatment plan using Invisalign, the dental professional orders case refinement. From June 2001 through April 2003, the Company offered its dental
professionals the opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount. The advance purchase price was non-refundable. Revenue, in the amount of the stand-alone sales price of the undelivered element, is deferred until the earlier of
shipment of the case refinement or case expiration. In cases where the dental professional did not purchase case refinement in advance, case refinement revenues are recognized when the new Aligners are shipped.

In May 2003, the Company updated its domestic pricing policy to include the
future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer additional case refinements at a price of $125 each, which the Company believes represents its fair value based on competitive product offerings. Revenue deferrals
associated with case refinement after May 1, 2003 are $125 per case. This revenue deferral represents the fair value of a case refinement as determined in accordance with EITF 00-21, which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that
involve the delivery of multiple products or services. These revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been utilized or upon case expiration, which ever is earliest.

Service revenues earned under agreements with third parties for training of
dental professionals and staff for Invisalign are recorded as the services are performed. Charges to third parties are based on negotiated rates which are intended to approximate a mark-up on anticipated costs.



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Company estimates and records a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales, if any, in
the period such sales occur.

Research and development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Advertising costs

The cost of advertising and media is expensed as incurred. For the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 advertising costs totaled $5,003,000, $5,993,000 and $17,466,000, respectively.

Foreign currency

The Company uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at current exchange
rates. Revenues and expenses are re-measured at average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency re-measurement are included in other income (expense).

Income taxes

Income taxes are recorded under the liability method, under which deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

Stock-based compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”) and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).

Under APB 25, compensation expense for grants to employees is
based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the Company’s stock and the option’s exercise price. SFAS 123 defines a “fair value” based method of accounting for an employee stock option or
similar equity investment.



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations and complies with the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.”
The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per common share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation:

Such pro forma
disclosure may not be representative of future compensation cost because options vest over several years and additional grants are anticipated to be made each year.

The value of options granted to employees is estimated on the date of grant using the minimum value method for shares issued

Segments

The Company reports segment data based on the management approach which
designates the internal reporting that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable operating segments. During all periods presented, the Company operated in a single
business segment. No single country, other than the United States of America, accounted for 10% or more of assets or 10% or more of revenues in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period from non-owner sources. Net
loss and other comprehensive loss, including unrealized gains and losses on investments, are reported, net of their related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive loss.

Net loss per share

Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less the weighted average number of shares of common stock that are subject to repurchase. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential common stock if the effect would be
anti-dilutive. Potential common stock consists of common stock subject to repurchase, incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options.

The following is a reconciliation of the numerator (net loss available to common stockholders) and the denominator (number of shares) used in the basic
and diluted net loss per share calculations (in thousands, except per share data):

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of FAS 149 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how companies classify and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires companies to classify a
financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). SFAS No. 150 is effective beginning second quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 150 to have a material impact
on its consolidated financial statements.

Capitalized lease obligations

In February 2000, the Company leased a stereolithography machines from Leasing Technologies International, Inc.
(“LTI”) under a master lease agreement entered into between the Company and LTI in August 1999. Under the terms of the lease, the value of the leased equipment is $729,000 at a borrowing rate of 11.154% per annum. The term of the lease is
for 48 months with a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease to purchase the equipment at 15% of the purchase price.

In May and August 2000, the Company leased two stereolithography machines from 3D Capital Corporation (“3D”) under a Master Lease Agreement
entered into in March 2000 for a total value of $1,479,000 at a borrowing rate of 6.533% per annum for a period of 60 months. In July 2001 this lease was assigned to DeLage Landen.

Future minimum payments under capital lease obligations are as follows (in thousands):

Contingencies

In October 2003, the Company entered into a Loan
Agreement with General Orthodontics, LLC, whereby the Company agrees to make loan advances to General Orthodontics, LLC of amounts not to exceed an aggregate principle balance of $200,000. The commitment by the Company to make loans to General
Orthodontics, LLC shall expire upon General Orthodontics, LLC obtaining alternative financing. Interest on the loans will accrue on the unpaid principal amount of the outstanding loans at an annual rate of 5%. All loan advances and accrued interest
are due and payable no later than October 2006.

On January 6,
2003, Ormco Corporation filed suit against us in the United States District Court for the Central District, Orange County Division, asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432, 5,683,243 and 6,244,861. The complaint seeks unspecified
monetary damages and injunctive relief. On February 18, 2003, we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity and non-infringement of the asserted patents. In addition, we counterclaimed for
infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548, seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. Ormco filed a reply to our counterclaims on March 10, 2003 and asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaration by the Court of
invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548. We responded to Ormco’s counterclaims on April 2, 2003. We amended our counterclaim to add Allesee Orthodontic Appliances, Inc. (“AOA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ormco,
as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548. The Court then permitted Ormco to amend its Complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim to add an additional patent each. Ormco filed a first
amended complaint for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 on



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

October 15, 2003. On October 27, 2003, we filed an answer to Ormco’s first amended complaint and a counterclaim for invalidity and non-infringement of
U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 and for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,554,611.

At a Scheduling Conference held on November 24, 2003, the Court set a June 10, 2004 discovery cutoff and an October 2004 trial date.

Three years ago, Ormco filed suit against us asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243. In June
2000, the parties entered into a Stipulation of Dismissal with Ormco. Ormco agreed for a period of at least two years not to pursue litigation with respect to these patents, except as set forth below. Further, Ormco agreed that it would not bring
any patent action against us for at least a period of one year with respect to any as yet unissued patents. If Ormco were to bring such an action concerning as yet unissued patents after one year, the Stipulation of Dismissal would allow Ormco to
include in such an action claims involving U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243. In August 2001, Ormco notified us of the issuance of U.S. Patent No. 6,244,861 and offered a license for this patent. We did not take a license to this patent. Five
months after Ormco’s notification, it filed the lawsuit that is currently pending.

The claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243 relate to methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances. The relevant claims are limited to computerized methods and algorithms
for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient. The claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,244,861 and 6,616,444 are more generic claims relating to the methods and systems for
forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances. Based on the disclosure in the patent, however, the relevant claims also appear to be limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s
teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient. The treatment plan simulation developed in our facilities determines the final positioning of a patient’s teeth but is not based on a derived or ideal dental archform of the
patient.

The claims in our U.S. Patent Nos. 6,398,548 and
6,554,611 relate to methods and systems for incrementally moving teeth using a series of appliances designed to be placed successively on the patient’s teeth.

We strongly believe that Ormco’s claims of infringement lack merit and that our counterclaim of infringement will be
successful. However, the outcome of a lawsuit is inherently unpredictable. Should our technology be found to infringe any one of Ormco’s asserted patents, we would have to seek a license from Ormco, which might not be available on commercially
reasonable terms or at all. In that event, we could be subject to damages or an injunction, which could materially adversely affect our business.

From time to time, we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. While we do not
believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention, there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits,
interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination in a patent suit by Ormco or
in any other litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities. An adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or
require us to seek licenses from third parties. Licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in which event, our business would be materially adversely affected.

On April 9, 2002, the Company exercised its right to terminate an Exclusive Marketing Agreement dated
October 18, 2001 with Discus Dental Impressions, Inc. pursuant to the express terms of the Agreement and issued a press release reporting this termination. On or about May 14, 2002, the Company received a demand for arbitration submitted by Discus
Dental with the American Arbitration Association in San Jose, California. In its arbitration demand, Discus Dental sought damages of approximately $30 million, including commissions and bonus payments it claims it would have allegedly received under
the Agreement as well as other expenses, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief to prevent the Company from selling Invisalign to dentists in the U.S. and Canada. Based on a review of the factual and legal issues, the Company denied all claims
made by Discus Dental in its demand and contended that such claims were entirely without merit. In addition, on or about June 13, 2002, the Company submitted a counter-claim against Discus in the arbitration seeking damages of approximately $40
million arising out of the Company’s claims for misrepresentation, breach of confidentiality provisions, and unfair competition, among others. Three arbitrators were selected (the “Panel”), and the arbitration hearing commenced in San
Francisco on August 18, 2003. The parties completed presenting witness testimony on September 9, 2003. The parties completed all post-hearing legal briefing on October 10, 2003, and closing argument was heard on October 29, 2003. At the closing
argument before the Panel, Discus sought lost profit damages of $46.5 million and loss of good will/out of pocket damages of $13.5 million. The Company previously and voluntarily dismissed its damage counter-claims but maintained its counter-claim
for declaratory relief, seeking a judicial declaration that the Company properly terminated the Agreement with Discus.

On February 9, 2004, the Panel issued its final arbitration award which concluded the arbitration proceedings initiated by Discus. Under the final
arbitration award, Discus is entitled to a judgment in the amount of $1.00 in damages and reasonable attorney fees and costs in the amount of $2.1 million. In reaching their decision, the arbitrators found that Align’s termination of its
marketing agreement with Discus in April of 2002 was wrongful. The Company included the $2.1 million charge relating to the final arbitration award in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003.

The Company is subject to claims and assessments from time to time in the
ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that any such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 6    Restructuring, Land and Impairment

In July 2002, the Company announced a plan to streamline worldwide
operations. The plan included closing the Company’s facilities in Pakistan and the U.A.E. The Company transitioned operations performed at these facilities to the United States and Costa Rica. For the period ending December 31, 2002, the
Company recorded severance charges of $2.3 million, facility closure charges of $0.9 million, a loss on disposal of fixed assets of $1.1 million and an impairment charge of $0.9 million related to the land in Pakistan. The land was written down to a
zero value to reflect its fair value as estimated by management. Approximately $0.1 million of accrued charges related to professional fees were included in accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2002. The Company discontinued operations at its
facilities in Pakistan and the U.A.E. in October and December 2002, respectively. The Company concluded the remainder of its indirect operational activities related to the Costa Rica transition in January 2003. The Company will cease non-operational
closing activities in Pakistan when the land is disposed of and in the U.A.E. when the necessary statutory filings have been completed.

Note 7    Credit Facilities

In December 2002 the Company obtained up to a $10.0 million revolving line of credit based on domestic accounts receivable. In December 2003, the Company
negotiated more favorable terms and increased the line of



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

credit up to $15.0 million which accrues interest at a rate of 0.5% above prime. In December 2002, the Company also obtained and accessed a $5.0 million
equipment-based term loan which accrues interest at a rate of 2.25% above prime. As of December 31, 2003 the Company had not drawn down the revolving line of credit and had not drawn down on any new funds in fiscal 2003 from the $5.0 million
equipment-based term loan. As of December 31, 2003, the equipment-based term loan had an outstanding balance of $3.3 million. Accessing the accounts receivable based revolving line of credit is restricted based on qualifying accounts receivable and
compliance with certain loan covenants. Principal payments are due in 36 monthly installments beginning in January 2003. Annual principal payments of $1.7 million are due for each of the years 2004 and 2005.

Note 8    Stockholders Equity

Preferred Stock

As of December 31, 2003, the Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, $0.0001 par value, none of which was issued and outstanding. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to determine the designation, powers, preferences and rights of preferred stock.

Common Stock

The holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends whenever funds
are legally available and when declared by the Board of Directors, subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of stock having priority rights as to dividends. The Company has not declared or paid and dividends as of December 31,
2003.

In January 2001, the Company completed an initial public
offering or IPO, of 10 million shares of common stock at $13.00 per share. In March 2001, the underwriters exercised an over allotment option for 628,706 shares. Net proceeds to the Company were approximately $125,976,000.

In November 2002, the Company completed a private placement of 9,578,944
shares of common stock to a group of institutional investors led by existing shareholders, at $1.90 per share. Net proceeds to the Company were approximately $18,146,000.

Restricted stock purchase agreement

The Company has sold shares of its common stock to founders of the Company under agreements which provide for repurchase of
the stock by the Company at the stock’s original purchase price upon termination of employment. The Company’s right to repurchase lapses at any time prior to the earlier of: (i) three years from date of agreement; (ii) the closing of an
“Asset Transfer” or an “Acquisition”; or (iii) the voluntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company. The Company has also sold shares of its common stock to employees, directors and consultants under the terms of
the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan that includes an early exercise feature. The Company’s right to repurchase under those terms lapses over the vesting period of the underlying option exercised. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, 200,298 and 636,809
shares of common stock, respectively, were subject to repurchase.

1997 Equity Incentive Plan

In April 1997, the
Company adopted the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan (the “1997 Plan”) under which the Board of Directors may issue incentive and non-qualified stock options to employees, directors and consultants. The Company has reserved 9,709,092 shares of
common stock for issuance under the Plan. The Board of Directors has the authority to determine to whom options will be granted, the number of shares, the term and exercise price. Options are to be granted at an exercise price not less than fair
market value for incentive stock options or 85% of fair market value for non-qualified stock options. For individuals holding more than 10% of the voting rights of all classes of stock, the exercise price of incentive stock options will not be less
than 110% of fair market value. Options become exercisable and vest on a cumulative basis at the discretion of the Board of



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Directors but at a rate not less than 20% per year over five years from the date of grant and generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary and
1/48th each month thereafter. The term of the options is no longer than five years for incentive stock options for which the grantee owns greater than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock and no longer than ten years for all other
options.

Executive Grants

In January 2001 the Company granted options (“Executive Grants”)
to purchase 1,000,000 shares, at an exercise price of $15.00 per share, to each of the Company’s then Chief Executive Officer and President. The options were granted outside of the 1997 Plan and prior to the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the
“2001 Plan”) becoming effective and represent options for an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of common stock in addition to the shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2001 Plan. The Executive Grant was approved by the
stockholders in January 2001.

2001 Stock Incentive Plan

On January 4, 2001, the Board of Directors adopted the
2001 Plan, which will terminate no later than 2011, provides for the granting of incentive stock options, non statutory stock options and restricted stock purchase frights and stock bonuses to employees, and consultants. As of December 31, 2003, a
total of 13,273,369 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance under the 2001 Plan. The 2001 Plan was approved by the Stockholders prior to the IPO.

Activity under the 1997 Plan, the Executive Grants and the 2001 Plan are set forth below (in thousands, except per share
data):

The weighted average
per share fair values of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $6.03, $3.50 and, $9.25, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On January 4, 2001, the Board of Directors adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, authorizing the issuance of 1,500,000 shares of common stock pursuant
to purchase rights granted to United States employees. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Employee Stock
Purchase Plan was approved by the Stockholders prior to the Initial Public Offering.

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined offering periods. The price at which stock is purchased under the Purchase
Plan is equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the subsequent designated purchase dates, whichever is lower. The initial offering period commenced on
January 25, 2001.

Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the
Company sold approximately 194,000 and 163,000 shares of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The fair value of the employees’ purchase rights was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following assumptions:



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Stock-based compensation

The Company records deferred stock-based compensation for the excess of the deemed fair market value over the exercise price
at the date of grant related to options granted to employees. The Company did not record stock-based compensation for the fiscal years 2003 and 2002 related to options issued to employees. In fiscal 2001 the Company has recorded deferred stock-based
compensation of $3,530,000 related to options issued to employees to purchase common stock. During fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company reversed $1,355,000, $12,419,000 and $12,673,000, respectively, of unrecognized deferred compensation
relating to employees that have terminated employment with the Company. The compensation expense is being recognized over the option vesting period of four years using the straight-line method. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001,
the Company recorded amortization of stock-based compensation of $12,419,000, $16,539,000 and $22,347,000, respectively, in connection with options granted to employees.

For options granted to consultants, the Company determines the fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. The Company has recorded additional (reversals of) deferred stock-based compensation of $365,000, $(316,000) and $(484,000) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for options issued to non-employees in fiscal 2001
and 2000. The compensation expense is being recognized over the option vesting period of four years, using the method presented by FIN 28. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded amortization of stock-based
compensation expense/(reversals of expense) of $377,000, $45,000 and $(138,000), respectively, in connection with options granted to consultants.

The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1,276,000 and $2,010,000 related to stock options granted to non-employees in fiscal 2003 and
fiscal 2002, respectively.

The Company accelerated the vesting
of options to several employees in connection with related severance packages. The acceleration was accounted for in accordance with FIN 44 as a one-time charge to the statement of operations. The charges for December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were
$959,000, $2,245,000 and $224,000, respectively. The charge was equal to the intrinsic value difference between the exercise price of the accelerated options and the fair value of the common stock on the date of acceleration.

Stock based compensation has been recorded as follows (in thousands):

Based on the available
objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December 31,
2003.

Reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax to
the Company’s effective tax:

As of December 31,
2003, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $171.2 million for federal purposes and $67.7 million for state tax purposes. If not utilized, these carryforwards will begin to expire beginning in 2017 for federal
purposes and 2005 for state purposes.

The Company has research
credit carryforwards of approximately $2.8 million and $1.3 million for federal and California state income tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal carryforward will expire in various amounts beginning in 2017. The California state credit can be
carried forward indefinitely.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986
limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event the Company has had a change in ownership, utilization of the carryforwards could be
restricted.
