PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Our Company

Align Technology, Inc. designs, manufactures and markets the Invisalign system, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion,
or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not
rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch wires and brackets, commonly referred to as
braces. We received the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. The Invisalign system is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device.

We
distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers: the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist, or GP. Orthodontists and GPs must complete
an Invisalign training course in order to provide the Invisalign treatment solution to their patients. The Invisalign system is sold in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Japan. We
use a distributor model for the sale of our products in parts of the Asia Pacific and Latin American region.

We
were incorporated in Delaware in April 1997. Our headquarters are located at 881 Martin Avenue, Santa Clara, California 95050, and our telephone number is
408-470-1000.



Industry Background

Malocclusion

Malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions, affecting over 195 million
individuals, or approximately 65% of the U.S. population. Approximately 2.1 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the U.S. While most individuals seek orthodontic
treatment to improve their appearance, malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay, tooth loss, gum disease, jaw joint pain and headaches. Because of the compromised
aesthetics, discomfort and other drawbacks associated with traditional orthodontic treatments, only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek treatment.

Traditional Orthodontic Treatment

In the U.S., dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets, commonly referred to as braces.
Occasionally, dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic, tooth-colored brackets or bond brackets on the inside, or lingual surfaces, of the patient's teeth. Dental
professionals also augment braces with elastics, metal bands, headgear and other ancillary devices.

The
average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement, or chair time. To initiate treatment, a
dental professional will diagnose a patient's condition and create an appropriate treatment plan. In a subsequent visit, the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient's teeth with cement
and attach an arch wire to the brackets. Thereafter, by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks, the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the
patient's teeth to achieve desired tooth
movement. Because of the length of time between visits, the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval. In a final
visit, the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient's teeth. Upon completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or her discretion, have the
patient use a retainer.

Fees
for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between U.S. $3,500 to $7,000 with a median fee of approximately $5,000; generally only a portion of the fee is reimbursed by
insurance. In addition, dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives. Fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional's
estimate of chair time, and are generally negotiated in advance. A treatment that exceeds the dental professional's estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time,
and reduced profitability for the dental professional.

Limitations of Traditional Orthodontic Treatment

Although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions, they are subject to many limitations and
disadvantages. Traditional orthodontic treatment is associated with:

•

Unattractive appearance.

Braces call attention to the
patient's condition and treatment. In addition, braces trap food, which can further compromise appearance. Braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth. Many adults associate braces with
adolescence. As a result of these and other limitations, relatively few adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment annually.

•

Oral discomfort.

Braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade
and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth. The tightening or adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort, especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic
visit.



•

Poor oral hygiene.

Braces compromise oral hygiene by
making it more difficult to brush and floss. These problems can result in tooth decay and periodontal damage. Additionally, the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth.

•

Inability to project treatment.

Historically, dental
professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment. Accordingly, dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan and project treatment. As a
result, they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits. This lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the
dental professional's ability to estimate the duration of treatment. Because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis, extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the
dental professional.

•

Physical demands on dental professional.

The manipulation
of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity, and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional.

•

Root resorption.

The sustained high levels of force
associated with traditional treatment can result in root resorption, which is a shortening of tooth roots. This shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient.

•

Emergencies.

At times, braces need to be repaired or
replaced on an emergency basis. Such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional.

Due
to the poor aesthetics, discomfort and other limitations of braces, relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment. Accordingly, we believe there is
a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns. We also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the
predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability.

The Align Solution

Invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion. The Invisalign system is comprised of several phases, the principal steps
of which are the creation of digital treatment plans using proprietary software known as ClinCheck, and the manufacturing of customized Invisalign aligners.

Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us.

In an initial patient visit, the dental professional determines whether
Invisalign is
an appropriate treatment. The dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinyl-siloxane, or PVS impression of the relevant dental arches, x-rays of
the patient's dentition, photographs of the patient, a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patient's upper and lower dental arches and an Invisalign treatment planning form, or
prescription. The impression is a critical component of the Invisalign system as it depicts the three-dimensional geometry of the patient's teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models and
subsequent molds and aligners. An impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material. This material hardens, capturing the shape of the patient's teeth. The prescription is also a
critical component of the Invisalign system, describing the desired positions and movement of the patient's teeth. The dental professional sends the treatment data to our facility in Juarez, Mexico.
Manufacturing services are currently provided by International Manufacturing Solutions Operaciones, S.R.L., or IMS, a third party shelter services provider in Juarez, Mexico. On December 22,
2008, we notified IMS of our intention to terminate this shelter services arrangement effective April 2009. At that time, we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in
Juarez, Mexico.

Preparation of three-dimensional computer models of the patient's initial malocclusion.

Upon receipt, we use the treatment data to
construct digital
models of the patient's dentition. Using computed



tomography,
known as CT scanning, we scan the PVS impression to develop a digital, three-dimensional computer model of the patient's current dentition. We then transmit this initial computer model
together with the dental professional's prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in San Jose, Costa Rica.

Preparation of computer-simulated treatment and viewing of treatment using ClinCheck.

In Costa Rica, we transform this initial digital
model into a
proposed customized, three-dimensional treatment plan that
simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two-week increments. This simulated treatment plan, called ClinCheck, is an internally developed and proprietary computer modeling
program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients. This ClinCheck simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality
standards. Upon completion of the review, the patient's ClinCheck is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via Virtual Invisalign Practice (VIP), our proprietary customer
interfacing software portal, which is available on our websites located at

www.invisalign.com

and

www.aligntech.com

. The dental professional then reviews
the ClinCheck and can either accept the proposed treatment or request modifications and
adjustments until satisfied with the treatment plan. ClinCheck allows the dental professional to view this three-dimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle.
Accordingly, ClinCheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets. By reviewing and amending the
treatment simulation, the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and, thus participates in the customized design of the aligners. At this point, the dental professional may also
invite the patient to view the ClinCheck treatment plan, allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment. The dental professional's final approval of the proposed ClinCheck treatment
engages us to manufacture the corresponding molds and aligners.

Construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment.

Upon the dental professional's approval of the ClinCheck simulation, we
use the data
underlying the simulation, in conjunction with stereolithography technology, to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient's teeth. Each mold is a replica of the
patient's teeth at each two-week stage of the simulated course of treatment. IMS currently manufactures the molds and then uses these molds to fabricate the patient's aligners. As stated
above, in April 2009, we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in Juarez, Mexico.

Manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional.

From these molds, aligners are fabricated by pressure-forming
polymeric sheets over
each mold. Aligners are custom-manufactured, thin, clear plastic, removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two-week stage of the ClinCheck
simulation. Aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using ClinCheck. Each aligner covers a patient's teeth and is nearly invisible
when worn. Aligners are commonly worn in pairs, over the upper and lower dental arches. Aligners are generally worn for consecutive two-week periods which correspond to the approved
ClinCheck treatment simulation. After two weeks of use, the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series, advancing the teeth movement with each aligner stage. This process is repeated until
the final aligners are used and treatment is complete. When treating with Invisalign Full, Invisalign Express and Invisalign Teen, aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental
professionals in a single shipment. For Invisalign Assist, aligners are manufactured in batches based on a progress tracking feature integrated into Invisalign Assist. When the progress tracking
feature is selected, aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages. In certain cases, dental professionals may use Invisalign in conjunction with tooth-colored attachments
bonded to the patient's teeth. These attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired
movement. In certain cases, we provide an aligner-like template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient's teeth. Also, in cases where
interproximal reduction, or IPR, is



requested
by the dental professional, we provide an IPR treatment form, quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction, location, and timing of IPR.

Retention.

Upon completion of the treatment, the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our Vivera retainer
product. New
Vivera retainers are shipped every three months over the one year period.

Our Products

Our revenues are generated from the sale of the following product offerings.

Invisalign Full.

Commercial sales of Invisalign Full commenced in the U.S. in July 1999. Our traditional,
Invisalign Full is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions. Each treatment plan is unique to the individual patient and will consist of as many aligners as
indicated by ClinCheck in order to achieve the doctor's treatment goals. For Invisalign Full, aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment. In fiscal
2008, approximately 85% of our net revenues were generated by the sale of Invisalign Full.

Invisalign Express.

In the third quarter of 2005, we launched Invisalign Express, a lower-cost solution for less complex orthodontic
cases. Invisalign Express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten sets of aligners. Invisalign Express is intended to
help a broader range of patients elect orthodontic treatment by providing a lower-cost option for adult relapse cases, for minor crowding and spacing, or as a pre-cursor to
restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers. For Invisalign Express, aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment.

Retention.

In addition to our traditional single retainer product, in January 2008, we launched Vivera retainers, where we deliver a
new replacement
retainer to orthodontic patients every three months for one year. Vivera retainers are produced using the same proprietary technology and material as the Invisalign aligners, and offer an effective,
aesthetic retention solution for both Invisalign and non-Invisalign patients.

Invisalign Teen.

In July 2008, we launched Invisalign Teen to meet the specific needs of the non-adult comprehensive or teen treatment
market. Invisalign Teen includes features such as an aligner wear indicator to help gauge patient compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address lingual root control issues and the
natural eruption of key teeth common in teen patients. Predominantly marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teen patients, these features are intended to meet the
treatment needs of those younger patients. As part of Invisalign Teen, we include up to six free individual replacement aligners during active treatment to cover potential aligner loss. For Invisalign
Teen, aligners (other than the replacement aligners) are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment.

Invisalign Assist.

In October 2008, we launched Invisalign Assist. Invisalign Assist is designed specifically for GPs who want an
integrated
approach to selecting, monitoring and finishing Invisalign cases. Intended to help newly-trained and low volume GPs accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of Invisalign into their
practice, Invisalign Assist is intended to make it easier for GPs to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach, submit cases more efficiently and manage
appointments with suggested tasks. In addition, new progress tracking features allow GPs to submit new impressions every nine stages. When the progress tracking feature is selected, aligners
are shipped to
the dental professional after every nine stages. We believe Invisalign Assist will help GPs increase their confidence in prescribing Invisalign treatment.



Proprietary
software mentioned in this Annual Report on Form 10-K such as ClinCheck and VIP (Virtual Invisalign Practice) are included as part of the Invisalign system
and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue.

Ancillary and Other.

The remaining net revenues are generated by training fees and sales of ancillary products, such as cleaning
material and
adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment.

Benefits of Invisalign

We believe that Invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish Invisalign as
the preferred alternative to traditional braces.

Benefits to the dental professional

•

Ability to visualize treatment and likely
outcomes.

ClinCheck enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely outcome of treatment in an interactive
three-dimensional computer model. ClinCheck allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient.

•

Begin using Invisalign with minimal additional
training.

The biomechanical principles that underlie treatment with the Invisalign system are consistent with those of traditional
orthodontics. Dental professionals can complete our initial training in one day. We provide additional clinical support following the initial training and encourage dental professionals to attend
continuing education classes, seminars and workshops.

•

Expanded patient base.

We believe that Invisalign has the
potential to transform the practice of orthodontics. Currently, approximately 2.1 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the U.S. As of December 31, 2008, our share
of the 2.1 million case starts is approximately 3 percent. Our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional
treatment because of its many limitations. We believe that since Invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces, adults, who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional
treatment, will be more likely to seek treatment. We therefore believe that Invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment. In
addition, as the primary care provider, GPs have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce Invisalign and expand their practice and
patient base.

•

Practice productivity.

We believe that as dental
professionals move to a higher volume of Invisalign patients, they will be able to better leverage their existing resources, including staff time and office space resulting in an increase in daily
patient appointments and practice productivity.

Benefits to the Patient

•

Excellent aesthetics.

Aligners are nearly invisible when
worn, significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with traditional braces.

•

Comfort.

By replacing the six-week adjustment
cycle of traditional braces with two-week stages, aligners move teeth more gently. Also, aligners are thin, smooth and low in profile. As a result, aligners are more comfortable and less
abrasive than traditional braces.



•

Improved oral hygiene.

Patients can remove aligners for
tasks that are difficult with traditional braces, such as eating, brushing and flossing. We believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay and periodontal damage during treatment, which
may result from traditional braces.

•

Potentially reduced overall treatment time.

Aligners
control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth. In addition, the ClinCheck simulation from which aligners are produced is designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary
tooth movements. Together, these factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to traditional braces.

•

Potentially reduced root resorption.

We believe that
controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root resorption, which is the breakdown or destruction of root structure.

•

Reduced incidence of emergencies.

Typically, a lost or
broken aligner is simply replaced with the next aligner in the treatment series, minimizing inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional.

We
believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of traditional braces.

Limitations of Invisalign

In some instances, the Invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to traditional treatment. Aligners cost more to produce
than traditional braces, and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in traditional treatment. Depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental
professional and the treatment selected, the cost of Invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for traditional braces. Dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle
times into their overall treatment plan. Once a dental professional submits a case to us, there is generally a turn-around time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are
delivered. Aligners may not be appropriate for all cases, such as severe malocclusion, which may require aligners to be used in combination with traditional braces for optimal results. In addition,
because aligners are removable, treatment using Invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended. Some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners
that may mildly affect speech. In some instances, patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums, cheeks and lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have occurred. We believe that
these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of Invisalign to both patients and dental professionals.

Our Target Market and Patient Base

Approximately 2.1 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the U.S., of which approximately
1.2 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to Invisalign—our served market. Twenty-six percent of these patients, or approximately
300 thousand, have mature dentition (adults and older teens), with fully-erupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth. Seventy-four percent, or approximately
850 thousand, have erupting dentition (non-adult comprehensive, or younger teens), with partially-erupted second molars, cuspid and second bicuspid teeth. As of December 31,
2008, our share of the 2.1 million case starts is approximately 3% and approximately 6% of the 1.2 million patients of our served market.

Our
market research indicates that the majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations. We
believe that since Invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces, adults, who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment, will be more likely to seek
treatment and therefore represent our most immediate market expansion opportunity. With the launch of Invisalign Teen in July



2008,
we now offer a product designed to meet the needs of the non-adult comprehensive, or younger teen, treatment market. Even though we have not previously marketed our product to treat
younger patients, approximately 18% of our total case starts since 2007 were with individuals younger than 19. Launching Invisalign Teen makes our treatment more applicable to an orthodontist's
patient base, which we believe will provide us the opportunity to increase our penetration into and our share of the teen treatment market.

Published
market data for GPs providing treatment for malocclusion is limited, however, as the primary care provider, GPs have access to a greater number of patients than
orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce Invisalign and expand their practice and patient base. We believe GPs represent a significant market expansion opportunity.

As
of December 31, 2008, approximately 944,000 patients worldwide have started treatment using Invisalign. The Invisalign system is sold in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific,
Latin America and Japan. International sales accounted for 21%, 17% and 16% of our net revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in
Note 17 "Segments and Geographic Information" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We operate as one reportable segment—the design, development, manufacturing and
marketing of Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth.

No
single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total net revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Business Strategy

Our goal is to establish Invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by
dental professionals by focusing on the following four key objectives: driving product innovation, enhancing the customer experience, generating consumer demand and expanding our international
markets.

Product innovation and enhancements to existing products.

We believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our
future
long-term goal to drive and sustain product adoption. Until 2008, the Invisalign system was a single offering used by our primary channels—GPs and
orthodontists—each with distinct and separate needs. In 2008, we launched additional products to better meet those distinct needs. Specifically, orthodontists want a more robust set of
tools for greater predictability, wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the Invisalign system. On the other hand, typical GPs want greater ease of use, more efficient and
simplified diagnostic tools, guidance through the case set-up process, minimal treatment intervention and self-help tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to
moderate malocclusion. Based on this knowledge, in July 2008, we announced the release of Invisalign Teen, predominantly marketed to the orthodontist. In October 2008, we announced the release of
Invisalign Assist, predominantly marketed to the GP.

With
the introduction of Invisalign Teen, our Invisalign product family now includes a product designed to meet the specific needs of the non-adult comprehensive or younger
teen market. Invisalign Teen features include an aligner wear indicator to help gauge patient compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address the natural eruption of key teeth and
lingual root control. Predominantly marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teen patients, these features make it easier and more efficient for orthodontists to treat
those younger patients. The launch of a teen-specific product makes the Invisalign system more applicable to an orthodontist's patient base, which we believe will increase our penetration
into and our share of the teen treatment market over time. We expect that orthodontists will adopt Invisalign Teen slowly, after they experience multiple successful treatment outcomes. As a result, we
anticipate that Invisalign Teen volume may increase gradually and will not constitute a significant portion of our total product mix in the near-term.



Our most recently launched product, Invisalign Assist, is intended to help newly-trained and low volume Invisalign GPs accelerate the adoption and
frequency of use of Invisalign into their practice. Invisalign Assist features are intended to make it easier for doctors to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach.
In addition, GPs can plan and submit cases efficiently, manage appointments with suggested tasks, and receive batch shipments of aligners based on treatment progress. We believe Invisalign
Assist will help GPs increase their confidence in prescribing Invisalign treatment.

We
believe continuing to introduce new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase adoption of
Invisalign. The recent launch of Invisalign Teen and Invisalign Assist and other future products will rely on new features, tools and delivery options to meet specific clinical demands while providing
a family of end-to-end solutions for our customers. Enhanced product performance and innovation should continue to drive the adoption and frequency of use (what we call
utilization). Although we believe new product introduction to be a cornerstone to our future long-term growth, we expect that adoption of these new products will increase gradually over a
number of years.

Enhancing the customer experience.

We are committed to enhancing the customer experience by focusing on specific customer "touch points",
 or areas
where we interact directly with our customers.
Specifically, we are focused on improving our pre-selection process in order to attract new doctors that are motivated to become Invisalign providers and committed to making Invisalign a
key part of their practices and strengthening our training programs in order to increase the rate that these newly trained customers submit Invisalign cases, as well as increase the rate that they
move up the adoption curve to ultimately become leading Invisalign providers, or what we call promoters.

•

Improving Training Programs.

Increasing the number of
Invisalign trained doctors and ensuring that these doctors are confident in using the Invisalign system is a key driver toward our ultimate goal of increasing product adoption. We continuously update
our training programs to address the needs of our customers. For instance, we developed a pre-training course intended to familiarize doctors with the Invisalign system prior to attending
the full training course. In addition, we recently updated our initial training program by focusing on Invisalign Assist, instead of Invisalign Full, since we believe Invisalign Assist is the right
product for newly trained GPs. We anticipate that by using Invisalign Assist, newly trained GPs will exit this initial training program with increased confidence in prescribing
Invisalign treatment. We have also incorporated the Invisalign technique into the curriculum of 38 university programs. By educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the
Invisalign technique, we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer Invisalign as a treatment option.

•

Moving from Invisalign provider to a leading Invisalign
provider.

Once a doctor is trained, our goal is to assist the doctor to move up the adoption curve to ultimately become a leading
Invisalign provider, or a promoter. In order to increase the number of Invisalign promoters, we provide additional services to help our customers increase their confidence in using the Invisalign
system through continuing education and clinical support as well as improving their practice management skills. In early 2008, we announced the introduction of the Aligntech Institute program
(

www.aligntechinstitute.com

), which is an interactive website that provides clinical education and practice development training. These clinical
education and practice development training opportunities include instructor-led training classes, seminars and workshops, conference calls, web-based videos, case studies, and
other clinical resources. Many of these courses and resources are eligible for continuing education (CE) credits. Additionally, our VIP portal (Virtual Invisalign Practice) provides our trained
doctors and their staff access to thousands of Invisalign cases and best practices as well as up-to-date support information, programs and marketing materials for continuous
support and information access. Lastly, as trained Invisalign



providers
grow their case starts with Invisalign, programs such as the Advantage Program provide tiered benefits including volume rebates, dedicated clinical support and a premium website position on
the Invisalign Doctor Locator website to those leading providers. By participating in these programs and the various events and educational offerings, we believe that our customers will emerge with a
better understanding of the product and its applicability, and with a greater aptitude for starting and finishing Invisalign cases successfully.

Consumer demand generation for Invisalign.

Marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to
driving
long-term growth. Our market research indicates that the majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many
limitations, such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort. By communicating the benefits of Invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers, we intend to increase the number of patients
who seek treatment using Invisalign. Historically, our marketing programs have been directed to an adult audience, however, with the introduction of Invisalign Teen, we will for the first time direct
our communication efforts directly to teens and their parents. Despite the continuing challenges in the U.S. economy and weak consumer spending, we believe that consumer demand creation is a key
component to our long-term growth. As a result, we will continue to invest in efforts to increase consumer awareness of Invisalign through a variety of media outlets. We will continue to
drive consumer demand among the adult population through our traditional TV advertising, as well as digital online media. In 2009, we will focus our efforts on the introduction of a new public
relations program for Invisalign Teen intended to access print, TV and online media. We also have a teen specific website and will increasingly leverage widgets, social media and blogs to directly
target teens.

Growth of international markets.

We will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of Invisalign by dental
professionals in our key
international markets, Europe and Japan. Similar to the domestic market, our objective internationally is to increase the number of doctors that are motivated to becoming an Invisalign provider and
committed to making Invisalign a key part of their practices. Through December 31, 2008, we have trained over 14,000 doctors, predominantly orthodontists in core Europe, our primary
international market. Product line expansion is key to providing doctors a solution that addresses a wider range of potential patient needs with greater treatment flexibility. In October 2008, we
launched Invisalign Express in Europe expanding our international product offerings. In Europe, the vast majority of orthodontic case starts are children and teens. With the introduction of Invisalign
Teen in Europe, planned for mid-2009, we expect the addressable market for our product to expand and ultimately increase adoption. In addition, we will carry on our efforts to increase
brand awareness and consumer demand in Europe by continuing our consumer advertising campaign that was first launched in March 2007. Additionally, although the vast majority of our international
revenues are from direct sales, approximately 9% of our international sales are through distributors covering smaller international markets, specifically Asia Pacific and Latin America. We will
consider selling through distributors in other smaller or less strategic markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a case-by-case basis. With
these efforts, we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future. In 2008, our international sales
increased from 17% of net revenues to 21% of net revenues, an increase of approximately 34%.

Manufacturing

To produce our highly customized, highly precise, medical quality products in volume, we have developed a number of proprietary
processes and technologies. These technologies include complex software solutions, CT scanning, stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication.

Manufacturing
administration is located in Santa Clara, California; however, our manufacturing facilities are located outside of the U.S, in San Jose, Costa Rica and Juarez, Mexico. As
of



December 31,
2008, our manufacturing and operations staff in the U.S. and Costa Rica consisted of 747 people. At our facility in Costa Rica, technicians use a sophisticated, internally
developed computer-modeling program to prepare digital treatment plans. Upon acceptance of the treatment plan by the dental professional, these plans are then transmitted electronically to Juarez,
Mexico. These digital files form the basis of ClinCheck and are used to manufacture SLA (stereolithography) aligner molds. Our order acquisition operations, the manufacturing of aligner molds and
aligners, as well as the packaging and shipment of aligners, are currently conducted by International Manufacturing Solutions Operaciones, S.R.L., or IMS, a third party shelter services provider in
Juarez, Mexico. On December 22, 2008, we notified IMS of our intention to terminate IMS' shelter services arrangement effective April 2009. At that time, we will become a direct manufacturer of
our clear aligners at the facility in Juarez, Mexico. Upon the completion of this transition, we will directly employ approximately 500 people in Mexico, each of whom is currently employed by IMS.
Information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading
"Risk Factors."

We
rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process. In the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to
supply us with their respective products, we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source.

Throughput Management

Because we manufacture each case on a build-to-order basis, we must conservatively build manufacturing capacity
for anticipated demand. To increase throughput, we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes.

In
order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of rate-limiting processes, or
bottlenecks. We continue to upgrade our proprietary, three-dimensional treatment-planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental
tasks for each case, thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in Costa Rica. We are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners
manufactured in Juarez, Mexico. In order to scale our manufacturing capacity, we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment.

Quality Assurance

Align's quality system is in compliance with Food & Drug Administration's Medical Device regulations, 21CFR Part 820, and
Health Canada's Medical Device Regulations. We are certified to EN ISO 13485:2003, internationally recognized standards for Medical Device manufacturing and of the Council of Canada. We have a
formal, documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined, understood and achieved. Systems, processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service
quality. We monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes, taking corrective action,
as needed.

Since
we custom manufacture aligners on a build-to-order basis, we do not offer refunds on our products. Because each ClinCheck and each aligner is unique, we
inspect the product at various points during the manufacturing process, to ensure that the product meets our customers' expectations. Aligners are subject to the Invisalign product warranty, which
covers defects in materials and workmanship. Our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the Invisalign case is completed. In the event aligners fall within the scope of the Invisalign
product warranty, we will replace the aligners at our expense. Our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the



purposes
for which they are intended. If a patient chooses not to wear the aligners, and as a result, requests additional Invisalign treatment, the dental professional pays the additional expense of
the replacement aligners. Warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient's dentition to us. We use the impressions to create a new ClinCheck treatment
plan for the dental professional to approve, from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment.

The
Invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using Invisalign. Actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved
ClinCheck
treatment plan. Deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors, such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw
growth.

Sales and Marketing

We market Invisalign by communicating Invisalign's benefits to dental professionals through our training programs, mail campaigns,
trade shows, trade journals and print media, and to consumers through a nationwide advertising campaign. Based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales, we believe that making consumers
aware of Invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for Invisalign. In order to serve anticipated demand, we continue to train a broad base of dental professionals.

Professional Marketing

Our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing Invisalign to orthodontists since July 1999. In 2001, we began marketing
Invisalign to GPs in our North American market. As of December 31, 2008 our North American sales organization consisted of 161 people, of which 134 were direct sales representatives and
27 were sales administration and management. Internationally, we had 41 people engaged in sales and sales support as of December 31, 2008. We continually evaluate cost effective ways to support
our customers in smaller markets. For instance, during 2007, we transitioned the sales of our products in part of the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions to a distributor model. We will consider
selling through a distributor in other smaller markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a case-by-case basis.

We
provide training, marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and GPs in the U.S. and Canada, which we consider our North American market, and internationally. As of
December 31, 2008, we had trained 55,510 dental professionals worldwide to use Invisalign. Of those trained dental professionals, approximately 74% are dental professionals in our North
American market. Within our North American market, we have trained 8,670 orthodontists and 32,660 GPs cumulatively through the end of 2008.

Invisalign
relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment. Our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format. The key topics
covered in training include Invisalign applicability, instructions on filling out the Invisalign treatment form, clinical tips and techniques, guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with
our ClinCheck software and the many other features of our website.

After
doctors complete their training, sales representatives may follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle Invisalign cases. These practice
development activities may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions, treatment planning processes and familiarizing them with our dental online portals and tools. Sales
representatives may also provide practice-building assistance, including helping the dental professional to market Invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media. Many
dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance.



Consumer Marketing

Our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources:

•

an orthodontist;

•

a GP;

•

consumer marketing and advertising;

•

our website, which can be accessed at either

www.invisalign.com

or

www.aligntech.com;

•

direct-to-consumer mail advertising and public relations efforts; and

•

other Invisalign patients.

In
2009, we expect higher marketing spending in Europe with a focus on consumer advertising, including television and print media to raise the profile of Invisalign and drive more
consumers to our most experienced doctors. We will continue to incur additional costs related to commercialization and launch of new products to market in the United States and Europe.

Research and Development

Our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of dental applicability of Invisalign, enhancing the software
used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our Invisalign system product lines, including the development of distinct product platforms for the GPs and orthodontists such as Invisalign
Assist and Invisalign Teen. Our research and development expenses were $26.2 million for 2008, $25.7 million for 2007, and $18.5 million for 2006.

In
an effort to demonstrate Invisalign's broad treatment capabilities, various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of Invisalign to
malocclusion cases, including those of severe complexity. We are also undertaking post-marketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing
process. As mentioned in our Business Strategy, we are making investments in the development of new products and enhancements of existing products to meet the needs of our customers and increase
adoption and utilization of Invisalign.

Intellectual Property

We believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage. As of December 31, 2008, we had 118
issued U.S. patents, 181 pending U.S. patent applications, and numerous foreign issued patents, as well as pending foreign patent applications.

See Item 3 "Legal
Proceedings" for a discussion on Reexamination Proceedings pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

We
continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through U.S. and foreign patent applications and non-disclosure agreements. We also seek to protect our
software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that
have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products. Our intellectual property rights may not be
successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where Invisalign is distributed do not protect our
intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business. Information regarding risks associated with failing to
protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors."



Seasonal Fluctuations

Seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected, and are likely to
continue to affect, our business. Specifically, our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases. These seasonal trends have caused
and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.

Backlog

Due to the nature of our business, we maintain relatively low levels of backlog. The period from which treatment data (or "a case") is
received until the acceptance of the digital treatment plan, or ClinCheck, is dependent on the dental professional's discretion to modify, accept or cancel the treatment plan. Therefore, we consider
the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved ClinCheck. Our backlog consists of ClinCheck-approved cases, which are generally shipped within a short period
of time. As a result, we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future sales, and our quarterly revenues depend largely on the timing of ClinCheck approvals and the impact on cases shipped in
that quarter.

Competition

We compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances (or wires and brackets),
which include 3M Company, Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply International, Inc. We also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are
similar in use to Invisalign, including the products manufactured and distributed by Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron Dental Specialties (a division of Danaher Corporation). See

Item 3 "Legal
Proceedings"

for a summary of our litigation with Ormco. In the future, we may face further competition from early stage and more
mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to Invisalign. Information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be
found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors."

We
believe that in addition to price, the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following:

•

aesthetic appeal of the treatment method;

•

effectiveness of treatment;

•

customer support;

•

comfort associated with the treatment method;

•

oral hygiene;

•

ease of use; and

•

dental professionals' chair time.

We
believe that Invisalign compares favorably with our competitors' products with respect to each of these factors.



Government Regulation

FDA's Quality System Regulation for Medical Devices.

The Invisalign system is classified as a Class II medical device. In 1998, we
received
pre-market clearance from the FDA pursuant to the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure, allowing us to market the product in the U.S. The Invisalign system was originally
cleared for use by the FDA in patients with permanent teeth and contraindicated the device for patients presenting with mixed dentition, severe overbite, severe overjet, tooth malocclusion requiring
surgical correction, adolescent patients with a skeletally narrow jaw, and adult patients with dental prosthetics/implants. In 2008, the FDA cleared new labeling for the Invisalign system, by removing
the permanent dentition limitation from the indications for use. In addition, certain conditions previously listed as contraindications will now be listed as precautions. We believe our Invisalign
system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations, record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the Invisalign system. Our
aligners are currently manufactured by IMS, a third party shelter services provider based in Juarez, Mexico. IMS is registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and is certified to
ISO 13485:2003 under Align's quality management system. We have also ensured that our quality system procedures and processes have been implemented at IMS to comply with the FDA's
Quality Systems standards. IMS has dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel in the manufacture and distribution of Invisalign. We and IMS are subject to routine inspections by the FDA
and state agencies to determine compliance with Quality System requirements. We are registered with the State of California as a medical device manufacturer. On December 22, 2008, we notified
IMS of our intention to terminate IMS' shelter services arrangement effective April 2009. At that time, we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in Juarez, Mexico.

If
the FDA determines that we or IMS failed to comply with the applicable FDA regulations, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us, ranging from a public
Warning Letter to more severe sanctions, including but not limited to financial penalties, withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution.

Health Canada's Medical Device Regulations.

In Canada, we are required to comply with Health Canada's Medical Device Regulations. Our
products are
registered with Health Canada. We believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in Canada.

European Union's MDD Requirements & ISO 13485:2003.

In Europe, Invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such, we
follow the
requirements of the Medical Device Directives. We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, which facilitates commercialization of Invisalign outside the United States and especially in Europe.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or
HIPAA,
Congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information. Confidentiality of
patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health
Information, referred to as the Privacy Standard, and other state laws and regulations. The Privacy Standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information.
Although compliance is the responsibility of the hospital, physician or other healthcare provider, we understand the importance to our customers and their patients of maintaining the confidentiality
of patient information. Accordingly, we have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the requirements of the Privacy and Security standards under HIPAA and applicable
corresponding state laws and regulations. Maintaining systems that are consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do



business
or provide services to our patients. Additionally, our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with HIPAA requirements.

Other Federal and State Laws.

As a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing
regulation under many
other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be, applicable to our business. We are a medical device manufacturer
subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations. These regulations, among other things, require that we maintain device and facilities registrations and listings as well as promote our
products as permitted by our FDA clearances. Furthermore, our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope
of their relationships with us. Laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects. For example, the confidentiality of patient medical information
and the circumstances under which such information may be used by us, released for inclusion in our databases, or released by us to third parties, are subject to substantial regulation by state
governments. These state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly. In addition, provisions under the federal
anti-kickback statute prohibit, among other things, paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in, or for the order,
purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by, Medicare, Medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs. Most states have also enacted illegal
remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws. These laws, which are evolving at the federal and state levels, are applicable to our financial relationships with, and any marketing or other
promotional activities involving, our dental professional customers. Violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had 1,394 employees, including 747 in manufacturing and operations, 339 in sales and marketing, 137
in research and development and 171 in general and administrative functions. We had 503 employees in North America, 721 employees in Costa Rica, 160 employees in Europe and 10 employees in Japan.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

We have only recently returned to profitability. If we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods, the market price for our common stock
may decline.

Although we maintained profitability in 2008, if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods, we will need to
continue to increase our revenues, while controlling our expenses. While we generated positive operating cash flow in 2008, we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow from
operations, from period to period, in the future. Because our business is evolving, it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth, and we have in the past not been and
may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates. If we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the
market price of our common stock will likely decline.

Our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price.

Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we
focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. Some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate
include:

•

limited visibility into and difficulty predicting the level of activity in our customers' practices from quarter to
quarter;

•

weakness in consumer spending as a result of the slowdown in the United States economy and global economies;

•

changes in the timing of receipt of case product orders during a given quarter which, given our cycle time and the delay
between case receipts and case shipments, could have an impact on which quarter revenue can be recognized;



•

changes in product mix;

•

seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments;

•

success of marketing programs from quarter to quarter;

•

changes in the timing of when revenue is recognized as a result of the introduction of new products such as Invisalign
Assist and Invisalign Teen;

•

changes to our effective tax rate;

•

unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity;

•

any disruptions in the manufacturing process, including unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new
production processes or natural or other disasters beyond our control;

•

the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors;

•

aggressive price competition from competitors;

•

costs and expenditures in connection with litigation;

•

inaccurate forecasting of revenues, production and other operating costs; and

•

investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to Invisalign.

To
respond to these and other factors, we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy, business
structure or operations. Most of our expenses, such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations, are relatively fixed in the short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on
our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations, whether caused by changes in consumer spending, consumer
preferences, weakness in the U.S. or global economies, changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product, or other factors, we may be unable to adjust spending quickly
enough to offset any shortfall in revenues. Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. You
should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.

We depend on the sale of the Invisalign system for the vast majority of our revenues, and any decline in sales of Invisalign for any reason, including as a result of a
decline in general economic conditions, or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect revenues, gross margin and net profits.

We expect that revenues from the sale of the Invisalign system will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for
the foreseeable future. Continued and widespread market acceptance of Invisalign by orthodontists, GPs and consumers is critical to our future success. If orthodontists and GPs
experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services, if consumers prove unwilling to adopt Invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate, if orthodontists
or GPs choose to use a competitive product rather than Invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines, our operating results would be harmed. Factors that could cause
adoption of Invisalign at a lower rate than we expect, as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below.



Consumers may not adopt Invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a continued decline in general economic
conditions.

Consumer
spending habits are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, gas prices, consumer confidence and consumer
perception of economic conditions. A general slowdown in the United States economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits
which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts or a reduction in the demand for Invisalign generally either of which would have a material adverse
effect on our sales and operating results. In addition, Invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment, and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find
it preferable to traditional treatment We have generally received positive feedback from both orthodontists, GPs and consumers regarding Invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a
clinical method for treatment of malocclusion, but a number of dental professionals believe that Invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients. Market acceptance will
depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals, as well as other factors including effectiveness, safety, ease of use, reliability, aesthetics, greater comfort and hygiene compared to
traditional orthodontic products and price for Invisalign compared to competing products.

Orthodontists and GPs may not adopt Invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate.

Our
success depends upon increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the Invisalign system by dental professionals (what we refer to as utilization). Invisalign requires
orthodontists, GPs and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways. Increasing adoption and cumulative use by orthodontists and GPs will
depend on factors such as the capability, safety, efficacy, ease of use, price, quality and reliability of our products, our ability to provide effective sales support, training and service and the
availability of competing products, technologies and alternative treatments. In addition, unanticipated poor clinical performance of Invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and,
consequently, reduced acceptance by dental professionals. Also increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals' efforts and commitment
to expand their Invisalign practice. If adoption and utilization does not increase as we anticipate, our revenues may fail to grow as expected and our operating results may be harmed.

The frequency of use by orthodontists or GPs may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all.

One
of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization, or the adoption and frequency of use, of the Invisalign system by new and existing customers. If utilization of
Invisalign by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or GPs does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate, our operating results could be harmed.

We may experience declines in average selling prices of our products.

In
response to challenges in our business, including increased competition, we have in the past reduced the list price of our products. In addition, we provide volume based discount
programs to our doctors. If we are to introduce any price reductions or expand our discount programs in the future or if participation in these programs increases, our revenues, gross margin and net
profits (losses) may be adversely affected. Furthermore, although the U.S. dollar is our reporting currency, a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies. Revenues and
profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by
changes in exchange rates. As a result, negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of revenues
and profits in our consolidated financial statements.



We may experience unexpected problems and expenses associated with the phased-relocation of our customer facing organizations to Costa Rica.

In October 2008, we announced a restructuring plan to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower our overall cost
structure. In addition to headcount reduction, the restructuring plan included the phased-relocation of our customer care, accounts receivable, credit and collections and customer event registration
organizations currently located in Santa Clara, California, to our facility in Costa Rica. We expect this relocation to be completed by the end of July 2009. This relocation is accompanied by a number
of risks and uncertainties that may affect our results of operations and statement of cash flows, including:

•

failure to successfully coordinate and phase the relocation of these customer facing organizations may cause our customers
to experience decrease in service levels;

•

the relocation may absorb significant management and key employee attention and resources that would otherwise be
available for the ongoing business operations;

•

failure to retain key employees who possess specific knowledge or expertise and upon whom we are depending upon for the
timely and successful transition to Costa Rica; and

•

difficulties in hiring employees in Costa Rica with the necessary skills to perform these customer facing functions.

If
any of these risks materialize in the future, our operating results, statement of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.

Our future success may depend on our ability to develop, successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products.

Our future success may depend on our ability to develop, manufacture, market, and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new
products. We launched Invisalign Teen in July 2008 and Invisalign Assist in October 2008. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop, sell and achieve market acceptance of
these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product. The extent of, and rate at which, market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a
function of many variables, which include, among other things, our ability to include functionality and features that address customer requirements, the availability of third-party reimbursement of
procedures using our new products, the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns. In addition, even if our new products are successfully introduced,
it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient. Since it takes approximately 12 to
24 months to treat a patient, our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are
available.

Our
ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation, including approval or clearance by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), and
foreign government agencies. Any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a
material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline.

A disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our revenues or a reduction in our earnings.

We are dependent on commercial freight carriers, primarily UPS, to deliver our products. If the operations of these carriers are
disrupted for any reason, we may be unable to deliver our products to



our
customers on a timely basis. If we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner, our customers may reduce their orders from us and our revenues and operating profits could
materially decline. In a rising fuel cost environment, our freight costs will increase. If freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any
reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of revenues, our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected.

We are dependent on our international operations, which exposes us to foreign operational, political and other risks that may harm our business.

Our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the U.S. At our facility in Costa Rica, technicians use a
sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program to prepare digital treatment plans, which are then transmitted electronically to the Juarez, Mexico. These digital files form the basis of
ClinCheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds. Our order acquisition, aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in Juarez, Mexico. In addition to the research and development
efforts conducted in our Santa Clara, California facility, we also carry out research and development at locations in San Jose, Costa Rica and Moscow, Russia. In October 2008, we announced the
phased-consolidation of our customer-care, accounts receivable, credit and collections and customer event registration organizations, which are currently located in Santa Clara,
California, to our facility in Costa Rica. We expect this relocation to be completed by the end of July 2009. Our increasing reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties
that may affect our business or results of operation, including:

•

difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally, as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with
the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations;

•

difficulties in managing international operations;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

import and export license requirements and restrictions;

•

controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process;

•

political, social and economic instability, including as a result of increased levels of violence in Juarez, Mexico;

•

acts of terrorism and acts of war;

•

interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services;

•

product or material transportation delays or disruption;

•

burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws;

•

trade restrictions and changes in tariffs; and

•

potential adverse tax consequences.

If
any of these risks materialize in the future, we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue.



We currently are transitioning from reliance on a shelter service arrangement to become a direct manufacturer of our products. If we fail to successfully manage this
transition, our business may be harmed.

We currently rely on IMS, a third party shelter services provider located in Juarez, Mexico, for order acquisition, to fabricate
aligner molds as well as finished aligners and to ship the completed product to customers. On December 22, 2008, we announced the termination of our shelter services arrangement with IMS
effective April 1, 2009. In addition to the risks related to international operations described in the risk factor above, any difficulties encountered by us with respect to a transition from a
third party shelter services arrangement to manufacture, including difficulties hiring and retaining qualified personnel could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner which
could harm our business. In addition, any delay in completing the transition could result in increased transition costs, which could decrease the amount of expected savings.

A key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process. If we are
unable to accurately predict our volume growth, and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand, the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely
affect our results of operations.

Training technicians to use our sophisticated computer modeling program that produces the digital treatment plan that forms the basis
of ClinCheck takes approximately 90 to 120 days. As a result, if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth, we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to timely
create ClinCheck treatment plans within the timeframe our customers expect. Any delay in ClinCheck processing time could delay the ultimate delivery of finished aligners to our customers. Such a delay
could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers. This could cause a decline in our revenues and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our headquarters, ClinCheck setup and other manufacturing processes are all principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters.

Our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in San Jose, Costa Rica. The operations team in Costa Rica creates
ClinCheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software. We are also transitioning our customer facing operations from Santa Clara, California to Costa Rica. In addition, our aligner molds and
finished aligners are fabricated in Juarez, Mexico. Both Costa Rica and Mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters. If there is a major earthquake or any other
natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located, our ability to create ClinCheck treatment plans or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in
our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners. In addition, our headquarters facility is located in the San Francisco Bay Area. An earthquake or other natural
disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations. Any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in
the future.

Currently, our Invisalign product competes directly against products manufactured and distributed by Ormco Orthodontics, a division of
Sybron Dental Specialties (a Danaher Corporation subsidiary), and traditional braces manufactured by 3M Company and Dentsply International. These manufacturers have substantially greater financial
resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may, in the future, attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product
economically unattractive. Large consumer product companies may



also
enter the orthodontic supply market. Furthermore, we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies. We may be unable to compete with these competitors
and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any
products developed by new or existing competitors, our business could be harmed. Increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions,
reduced gross margins, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, volume growth, net profit (losses) and stock price. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Our information technology systems are critical to our business. System integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations, which
could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems. All information technology systems are
vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources. As our business has grown in size and complexity, the growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our
information technology systems. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems. In addition, experienced computer programmers and hackers
may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Furthermore, sophisticated
hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture, including "bugs" and other
problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs could be
significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations, revenues and operating results.

We
are currently focused on adding more functionality into our business enterprise systems to more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications, such as
customer facing and manufacturing tools, and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future. System upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable
employee resources. Delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and
operating results. Furthermore, we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications, specifically ClinCheck and VIP. Software applications frequently contain errors or defects,
especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released. The discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result
in the following consequences, among others: loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation or increased service costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may be
harmed. Litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further
intellectual property protection for our products, both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our inability to do so could harm our competitive position. As of December 31, 2008, we had 118
issued U.S. patents, 181 pending U.S. patent applications, and 47 issued foreign patents, and 142 pending foreign patent applications.



We
intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive
position. However, our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents. Additionally, any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable,
circumvented, or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products. During fiscal 2005 and 2006, requests were filed with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") by a San Francisco, California law firm, acting on behalf of an unnamed party and in some instances acting on behalf of OrthoClear, requesting
re-examination of a number of our patents. In addition, any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under U.S. patents and intellectual property laws.
We also rely on protection
of our copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and our collaborative partners
upon commencement of a relationship with us. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential
information, and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur. Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents, copyrights or
trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth prospects. In particular, a failure to
protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology, which could adversely affect our pricing and market share. In addition, in an effort to protect our intellectual property
we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation. The potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future, whether or
not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us, are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations. Any of these results
from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.

We
are currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims. Management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal proceedings and claims will have a
material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. In addition, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling
could include monetary damages or, in cases where injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products. Any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect
our results of operations and stock price.

See Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of our material pending legal
proceedings.

While we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual
basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.

Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, we are required to furnish in our
Form 10-K an Annual Report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is
effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. While we currently believe our internal control
over financial reporting is effective, the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
and, as a result, the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over
financial reporting is effective in any future period (or if our auditors are unable to express an



opinion
on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial
reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.

If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products.

We are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering, technology development, sales and marketing personnel and
management teams. The loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our
business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, recruit, train and retain additional qualified personnel, including orthodontists. Few orthodontists are accustomed to working
in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices, universities and other research institutions. Thus, we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with
the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business. Furthermore, we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services. If we are unable to attract
and retain key personnel, our business could be materially harmed.

If we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim, our ability to grow our business may be severely limited.

Extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry. We have been sued
for infringement of third party's patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future. From time to time, we have received and may in the future receive letters
from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. While we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention, there may be
other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings
could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which
we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities. An adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us
to seek licenses from third parties. Licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in which event, our business would be materially adversely affected.

We maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies, and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is
restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases.

We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment, rapid prototyping machines, resin and other advanced
materials. We maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies. In particular, our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by a single supplier.
We are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer, the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process, from a single-source. In addition, technology changes by our vendors
could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive, time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes. Our growth may exceed the capacity
of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth. In the event of technology changes, delivery delays, or shortages of
or increases in price for these items, our business and growth prospects may be harmed.



We rely on our direct sales force to sell our products, and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business.

Our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our North American and international
markets. As of December 31, 2008, our North American sales organization consisted of 161 people, of which 134 were direct sales representatives and 27 were sales administration and regional
sales management. Internationally, we had 41 people engaged in sales and sales support as of December 31, 2008. We do not have any long-term employment contracts with the members of
our direct sales force. The loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business. If we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of
equivalent technical expertise and qualifications, or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish strong relationships with our customers within a
relatively short period of time, our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed. In addition, due to our large and fragmented customer base, we may not be able to
provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product. As a result, adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to
grow market share and increase our revenues may be harmed.

Complying with regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could
result in substantial penalties.

Our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and internationally. FDA regulations are wide
ranging and govern, among other things:

•

product design, development, manufacturing and testing;

•

product labeling;

•

product storage;

•

pre-market clearance or approval;

•

advertising and promotion; and

•

product sales and distribution.

Our
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following
sanctions:

•

warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;

•

repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;

•

operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;

•

refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses, or
modifications to existing products;

•

withdrawing clearance or pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and

•

criminal prosecution.

If
any of these events were to occur, they could harm our business. We must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the FDA and adhere to applicable Quality
System regulations. The FDA enforces its Quality System regulations through periodic unannounced inspections. Our failure or the failure of IMS to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an
adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action, and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers, which could be a
long and costly process.



Before
we can sell a new medical device in the U.S., or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain FDA clearance or approval, unless an exemption applies.
Obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. Even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the FDA, we may be
unable to maintain such clearances in the future. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future. Our inability to maintain or
obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business.

If the security of our customer and patient information is compromised, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable for related damages, and our reputation could be
impaired.

We retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers. Therefore, it is critical that our facilities and
infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure. Despite the implementation of security measures, our
infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. If we fail to meet our clients'
expectations regarding the security of healthcare information, we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired. In addition, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable if
our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner. Our insurance may not protect us from this risk.

If compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us, we may not be able to grow our business.

Participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered
by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be, applicable to our business. Furthermore, our healthcare provider customers are also
subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us.

The
healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. Regulations implemented pursuant to the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may
require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services, result in delays or cancellations of orders, or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products
and services by healthcare participants. The effect of HIPAA and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the
business risks created by HIPAA and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities.

Extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties.

In addition to medical device laws and regulations, numerous state and federal healthcare-related laws regulate our business, covering
areas such as:

•

storage, transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records;

•

prohibitions against the offer, payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare
services or goods or to induce the order, purchase or recommendation of our products; and

•

the marketing and advertising of our products.



Complying
with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time-consuming, and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and
marketing activities or our revenues.

We face risks related to our international sales, including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals.

We currently sell our products in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Japan and may expand into other countries from time to time.
We do not know whether orthodontists, GPs and consumers outside our North American market will adopt Invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate. In addition, sales of our
products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. The time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may
be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and requirements for such approvals may differ from FDA requirements. We may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the
other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future. We may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals. If we
experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the U.S., or if we fail to receive these approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international
markets in a timely manner, if at all.

Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims, and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation.

Medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. We may be held liable if any
product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable. Although we intend to continue to maintain product liability
insurance, adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. A product liability claim, regardless of its
merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal
defense costs. These costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management's attention away from the operation of our business, and could harm our business.

Historically, the market price for our common stock has been volatile.

The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are
beyond our control. The factors include:

•

quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity;

•

changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results;

•

speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations;

•

strategic actions by our competitors, such as product announcements or acquisitions;

•

announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our customers or competitors; and

•

general economic market conditions.



In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our
common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company's securities. If a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future, we would incur substantial legal fees, and our management's attention and resources would be diverted from
operating our business in order to respond to the litigation.

Future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price.

A large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders. These stockholders
have sold in the past, and may sell in the future, large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our
existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock
price.

Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations, could result in unfavorable accounting charges.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a significant
effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules
are as follows:

•

revenue recognition;

•

accounting for share-based payments; and

•

accounting for income taxes.

If we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted.

The primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal. To achieve this objective, a majority of our
marketable investments are investment grade, liquid, short-term fixed-income securities and money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. If the carrying value of our investments
exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we will be required to write down the value of our investments, which could
materially harm our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the U.S.
financial sector. With the current unstable credit environment, we might incur significant realized, unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments.

We have adopted a shareholders rights' plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired, which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are
benefited by may be prevented.

Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders. To date, our board of directors has designated 200,000 shares as Series A



participating
preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights' plan. The issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an
acquisition of the company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock. The shareholder rights' plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an
acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors. The shareholder rights' plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or
in a manner not approved by our board of directors, except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation, purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights' plan.

Our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period.

Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate. These factors
include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, the future levels of tax benefits of stock option
deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings. In addition, we have negotiated tax incentives with the Costa Rica
Ministry of Foreign Trade, an agency of the Government of Costa Rica. Under these incentives, all of the income we earn in Costa Rica during these eight to twelve year incentive periods is subject to
reduced rates of Costa Rica income tax. The incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2010. The Costa Rica corporate income tax rate that would apply, absent the incentives, is 30%
for 2009. As a result of these incentives, income taxes decreased by $1.3 million in 2008. In order to receive the benefit of the incentives, we must hire specified numbers of employees and
maintain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in Costa Rica. If we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason, our incentive could lapse and our income in Costa Rica would be subject to
taxation at higher rates, which could have a negative impact on our operating results.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California. We lease approximately 127,000 square feet of space where we house our
research and development and administrative personnel. We lease our Santa Clara facilities under four leases, which expire in June 2010. The combined monthly rent for the Santa Clara facilities is
approximately $64,000. Commencing July 1, 2005 and continuing on the first day of each calendar month thereafter, $11,000 will be deducted from the $1.3 million security deposit
previously paid by us to the lessor and such amount will be applied against the monthly base rent for the Santa Clara facilities.

We
operate a facility in San Jose, Costa Rica. The facility comprises approximately 63,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space. The monthly rent for the Costa Rica facility is
approximately $78,000. We renewed the lease in March 2008 for an additional five year term, which commenced in October 2008 and expires in September 2013. Our European headquarters are located in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands. On August 3, 2007, we entered into an amendment to the original lease agreement to expand the Amsterdam facility to approximately 16,000 square feet of office space.
This lease will expire in June 2012, with an option to renew for an additional five year term. We may also terminate this lease in June 2012 for a fee of $125,000. The monthly rent for the Amsterdam
facility is approximately $48,000.

On
December 22, 2008, we notified IMS of our intention to terminate IMS' shelter services arrangement effective April 2009. At that time, we will become a direct manufacturer of
our clear



aligners
at the facility in Juarez, Mexico and we will also assume IMS' lease with its landlord. The monthly rent for this 68,000 square foot facility is $30,000 and the lease expires in July 2013.

We
believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of
operations.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Ormco

On January 6, 2003, Ormco Corporation ("Ormco"), a division of Sybron Dental Specialties (a Danaher Corporation subsidiary),
filed suit against us in the United States District Court for the Central District, Orange County Division, asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432, 5,683,243 and 6,244,861. The
complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. Also in 2003, we counterclaimed for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548, seeking unspecified monetary damages and
injunctive relief. Ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 and we filed an answer to Ormco's first amended complaint and a counterclaim for
invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 and for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,554,611.

In
connection with these claims, in 2004, the Court granted five motions for summary judgment that we filed. First, the Court granted our motion for summary judgment of
non-infringement, finding that our Invisalign system does not infringe any of the asserted Ormco patents (5,447,432, 5,683,243, 6,244,861 and 6,616,444). Second, the Court granted in part
our motion for summary judgment of infringement, finding that Ormco and its subsidiary, Allesee Orthodontic Appliances, Inc. ("AOA") infringe certain, but not all, claims of our patents
Nos. 6,398,548 and 6,554,611 through the manufacture and sale of Red, White & Blue appliances. Third, the Court granted our motion for summary judgment of invalidity of Ormco's asserted
patents claims (5,447,432, 5,683,243, 6,244,861 and 6,616,444). As noted above, the Court earlier found that we do not infringe these patents. In addition, the Court also denied Ormco's and AOA's
motion for summary judgment seeking a finding of invalidity of our asserted patent claims (6,398,548 and 6,554,611). Fourth, the Court granted our summary judgment motion that our asserted patent
claims are not invalid based on the evidence currently before the Court. Although the Court granted that motion, it reopened discovery on two additional invalidity arguments Ormco and AOA asserted.
Fifth, the Court also granted our summary judgment motion that our patents are not unenforceable and granted Ormco's and AOA's summary judgment motion that Ormco and AOA did not willfully infringe our
patents.

On
February 24, 2005, the Court, on further summary judgment, confirmed the validity of all of the asserted claims of our 6,554,611 patent and two of the asserted claims of our
6,398,548 patent. The Court also found certain claims of our 6,398,548 patent to be invalid in view of prior use evidence. On May 26, 2005, the Court issued a permanent injunction (the
"Permanent Injunction") to enjoin Ormco and AOA from further infringement of Claims 10 and 17 of our 6,398,548 patent and Claims 1-3 and 7 of our 6,554,611 patent. On May 31, 2005,
Ormco and AOA filed a notice of appeal with the Federal Circuit from the Permanent Injunction.

There
have been two appeals. After the Permanent Injunction was entered, Ormco and AOA appealed that injunction and the orders of the District Court on summary judgment on which the
injunction was based. In April 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ("CAFC") issued a ruling declaring two out of a total of seventy-one claims in our US Patent
No. 6,398,548 and four out of a total of ten claims in US Patent No. 6,554,611 to be invalid as "obvious." The CAFC's decision reverses the California District Court summary judgment
order of validity.

The
6,398,548 patent consists of 71 claims; only claims 10 and 17 were at issue in the first appeal and CAFC ruling. These two claims are directed to a system of appliances and method of
repositioning



teeth
from an initial to a final tooth arrangement where at least some of the appliances are marked to show order of use. These claims contain further limitations requiring instructions as to the
order in which the appliances are to be worn and use of the appliances in intervals of 2-20 days.

The
6,554,611 patent consists of ten claims directed to a system for repositioning teeth that includes one or more intermediate appliances and a final appliance, provided in a single
package, as well as instructions which set forth the order in which the appliances are to be worn. The CAFC's ruling pertains only to claims 1, 2, 3 and 7 in the patent.

The
second appeal was from the final judgment. Ormco appealed the ruling of the District Court that 92 claims in four of its patents are not infringed by us and that the asserted claims
are invalid. We appealed the ruling of the District Court that certain claims of our 6,398,548 patent which were found to be infringed by Ormco's and AOA's Red, White & Blue appliances were
invalid. The CAFC issued a ruling on August 24, 2007, affirming the District Court's ruling that 86 out of 92 claims in Ormco's 5,447,432, 5,683,243, 6,244,861 and 6,616,444 patents are invalid
and not infringed by us. The CAFC reversed the District Court's non-infringement and invalidity rulings on six claims in Ormco's 6,616,444 patent. Ormco filed a petition for review with
the U.S. Supreme Court with respect to the portion of the CAFC's opinion that affirmed the District Court's ruling of non-infringement and non-enablement of Ormco's 86 claims.
The Supreme Court denied Ormco's petition, and the case on the six claims in Ormco's 6,616,444 patent were returned to the District Court for a determination of validity and infringement of those
claims. The District Court issued orders construing the claim terms at issue and granting our motion to amend our answer and counterclaim to assert Ormco's 6,616,444 patent is unenforceable due to
inequitable conduct. The parties are currently completing fact discovery.

On
February 25, 2009, the District Court issued rulings on various Summary Judgment and expert related motions. In summary, the District Court granted one of Ormco's motions on
one theory of infringement and granted our motion on two theories of non-infringement. Our invalidity argument supported by over fifty prior art references was unaffected. The District Court also
ruled that one of our inequitable conduct theories should be resolved at trial. A finding of inequitable conduct at trial could render the six claims at issue and possibly the family of Ormco patents
related to the 6,616,444 patent unenforceable.

Trial
on liability issues is scheduled for June 2, 2009. Despite the District Court's ruling of infringement on one of Ormco's theories, if the jury finds Ormco's six claims to be
invalid or unenforceable, there can be no liability for infringement. We intend to vigorously pursue our invalidity and inequitable conduct counterclaims at trial.

Other matters

USPTO

During fiscal 2005 and 2006, requests were filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") by a San Francisco,
California, law firm, acting on behalf of an unnamed party, requesting Ex Parte re-examination of our patents. A Reexamination Certificate has been issued regarding the 6,309,215,
6,398,548, 6,705,863, 6,217,325, 6,722,880, 6,318,994 and 5,975,893 patents and



therefore
these patents are no longer in reexamination. We received an Action Closing Prosecution on the 6,685,469 patent. The status of the 6,629,840 patent is as follows:

In this initial Office Action dated June 13, 2006, the examiners confirmed the validity of eight of the eleven claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,629,840 (the '840 patent) without amendment and preliminarily rejected
the remaining claims of the patents. The non-final initial Office Action presented us with the first opportunity to respond to the USPTO's review and interpretation of the prior art. On September 13, 2006, we submitted a response to the initial
Office Action. A petition seeking a waiver was filed on February 15, 2007 and was granted on April 17, 2007, granting a single interview. The interview was held on May 22, 2007, and an Interview Summary was filed with the USPTO on
June 21, 2007. We are awaiting further action by the USPTO.

As
part of the OrthoClear Agreement, OrthoClear agreed to take no further action with respect to the Inter Parte Requests, including the 6,629,840 patent.

Class Action

On May 18, 2007, Debra A. Weber filed a consumer class action lawsuit against us, OrthoClear, Inc. and OrthoClear
Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a OrthoClear, Inc.) in Syracuse, New York, U.S. District Court. The complaint alleges two causes of action against the OrthoClear defendants and one cause of action
against us for breach of contract. The cause of action against us titled "Breach of Third Party Benefit Contract" references our agreement to make Invisalign treatment available to OrthoClear
patients, alleging that we failed "to provide the promised treatment to Plaintiff or any of the class members".

On
July 3, 2007, we filed our answer to the complaint and asserted 17 affirmative defenses. On July 20, 2007, we filed a motion for summary judgment on the Third Cause of
Action (the only cause of action alleged against us). On August 24, 2007, Weber filed a motion for class certification. On October 1, 2007, we filed an opposition to the motion of class
certification and we are currently awaiting rulings from the Court. OrthoClear has filed a motion to dismiss. The initial case management conference and all discovery has been stayed pending the
Court's decision on the motion for class certification, OrthoClear's motion to dismiss and our motion for summary judgment.

Litigating
claims of the types discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us, is costly and diverts
the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations. Any of these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock
price. From time to time, we have received, and may again receive, letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. While we do not believe that we infringe any such rights
that have been brought to our attention, there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware.

On
February 18, 2009, the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market was $8.03 per share. As of February 18, 2009 there were approximately 184 holders of
record of our common stock. Because the majority of our shares of outstanding common stock is held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total
number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our credit facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with "Selected
Consolidated Financial Data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

Align Technology, Inc. designs, manufactures and markets the Invisalign system, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion,
or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a
desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch
wires and brackets, commonly referred to as braces. We received the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. The Invisalign system is regulated by the
FDA as a Class II medical device.

Each
Invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient. Our Invisalign Full treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by ClinCheck in order to achieve the doctors'
treatment goals. Our Invisalign Express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten sets of aligners. Invisalign Express
treatment is intended to assist dental professionals to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lower-cost option for adult relapse cases, for minor crowding and spacing, or as a
pre-cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers. Invisalign Teen, which was launched in July 2008, is designed to meet the specific needs of the non-adult
comprehensive or teen treatment market. Invisalign Assist, launched in October 2008, is intended to help newly-trained and low volume Invisalign GPs accelerate the adoption and frequency of use
of Invisalign into their practice. Upon completion of an Invisalign or non-Invisalign treatment, the patient may be prescribed our traditional retainer product, or our Vivera retainers, a
clear aligner set designed for ongoing retention.

Our
goal is to establish Invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the four key
objectives: driving product innovation, enhancing the customer experience, generating consumer demand and expanding into international markets. Each of these four key objectives is described more
fully in "Item I—Business—Business Strategy" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by this reference. In addition to whether
we successfully execute our business strategy, a number of other factors, the most important of which are set forth below, may affect our results during the remainder of 2009 and beyond.

•

Impact on consumer spending due to a decline in general economic
conditions.

Consumer spending habits are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries
and wage rates, gas prices, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. A general slowdown in the United States economy and certain international economies as well as an
uncertain economic outlook have adversely affected consumer spending habits. As a result of the decline in general economic conditions, we expect that our product volumes and revenues may decline in
2009 compared to 2008. In addition, the decline in general economic conditions may further have the impact of decreasing the number of orthodontic case starts overall.

Utilization Rates.

Our goal is to establish Invisalign as
the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption and frequency of use by dental



professionals,
or utilization. Our quarterly utilization rates from the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

Utilization Rates*

Utilization
rates = # of cases shipped divided by # of doctors cases were shipped to

As
set forth in the chart above, year over year utilization rates declined slightly for our domestic channel in each quarter of 2008 compared to the same quarter in 2007. We believe that the continued
economic slowdown has negatively impacted many of our North America customers. International utilization rates for the same periods, however, increased slightly.

•

Impact of new products on deferred revenue.

We launched
three new products in 2008: Vivera retainers in January 2008, Invisalign Teen in July 2008, and Invisalign Assist in October 2008. As a result of and depending upon customer adoption of these new
products, we expect our mix of products to begin shifting gradually. Key features of these new products include staged delivery of retainers with Vivera, up to six free individual replacement aligners
with Invisalign Teen and staged delivery of aligners with Invisalign Assist. As a result of these features, these new products will have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a
percentage of their average selling prices compared to Invisalign Full.

The
Vivera retainer includes four shipments per year, and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and then recognized as each shipment occurs. Revenue for the six replacement aligners included in
Invisalign Teen will be deferred based on their fair market value until the earlier of the replacement aligners being used or until the case is completed. For Invisalign Assist, when the progress
tracking feature is selected, aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages. As a result, for these cases, revenue will be deferred upon the first staged shipment and will be
recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment. In addition, included in the price of Invisalign Full treatment, we offer case refinement, which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient's
teeth to the desired final position. Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, and Invisalign Full include a deferral for case refinement. As these new products increase as a percentage of our total case
volume, deferred revenue on our balance sheet will increase.

•

Reliance on international manufacturing operations.

Our
manufacturing efficiency has been and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability. Currently, two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the
U.S. At our facility in Costa Rica, dental technicians use a sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program to prepare digital treatment plans. We currently rely on IMS, a third party
shelter services provider located in Juarez, Mexico, for order acquisition, to fabricate aligner molds as well as finished



aligners
and to ship the completed product to customers. On December 22, 2008, we notified IMS of our intention to terminate this shelter services arrangement effective in April 2009. At that
time, we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in Juarez, Mexico. Our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of management to effectively manage
these international operations, including any difficulties encountered by us with respect to a transition from a third party shelter services arrangement to a direct manufacturer, including
difficulties hiring and retaining qualified personnel. If our management fails in any of these respects, we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue. In addition, even if we have
case submissions, we may not have a sufficient number of trained dental technicians in Costa Rica to create the ClinCheck treatments, or if we are unable to ship our product to our customers on a
timely basis, our revenue will be delayed or lost, which will cause our operating results to fluctuate.

See Part I, Item 1A—"Risk Factors" for risks
related to our international operations as well as risks related to transitioning from reliance on shelter service arrangement to independent manufacturer.

•

Seasonal Fluctuations.

Seasonal fluctuations in the
number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Specifically, our customers often take vacation or are on
holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including
fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.

•

Foreign Exchange Rates.

Although the U.S. dollar is our
reporting currency, a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies. Revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into
U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates. We have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements
without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchanges rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the
reported amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements.

•

Restructurings.

During 2008, we announced restructuring
plans in July and October to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the overall cost structure. In July 2008, we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our full time headcount by
67 employees including initiating a phased-consolidation of order acquisition operations from our corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California to Juarez, Mexico, which was completed by the end of
2008. The October restructuring plan included a total reduction of 111 full time headcount in Santa Clara, California by July 2009 as we create a new shared services organization in our existing Costa
Rica facility that will consolidate customer care, accounts receivable, credit and collections, and customer event registration organizations, which are currently located in Santa Clara, California.
We anticipate phasing the relocation to Costa Rica in an attempt to minimize disruptions to customer service levels and expect the relocation to be completed by the end of July 2009. These actions
resulted in a restructuring charge of approximately $6.2 million in 2008, and we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $1.8 million over the first half of
2009. We expect to reinvest the annualized savings of these two restructurings in the execution of our key strategic initiatives.

See Part I,
Item 1A—"Risk Factors" for risks related to the October restructuring, including the phased-relocation of our customer facing operations to Costa Rica.

•

Review of our investment portfolio and policies.

Our cash
equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of the date of this Form 10-K consisted of U.S. government notes and bonds, corporate bonds and certificates of
deposits, agency bonds and discount notes and commercial paper. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and



limit
our exposure to interest rate, liquidity and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various
asset classes. As a result of current adverse financial market conditions, investments in some financial instruments, such as structured investment vehicles, sub-prime mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized debt obligations, may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we had no direct holdings in these
categories of investments and our indirect exposure to these financial instruments through our holdings in money market mutual funds was immaterial. As of the date of this
Form 10-K, we had no
impairment charge associated with our short-term investment portfolio relating to such adverse financial market conditions. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has very
little risk of impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired. See

Part I, Item 1A—"Risk Factors" for
risks related to global financial and securities markets.

Tax Valuation Allowance.

We continually evaluate both the
positive and negative evidence in assessing our need for a tax valuation allowance. As a result of our analysis, we released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets with the
exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2008.

•

Effective Tax Rate.

Our effective tax rate may vary
significantly from period to period. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to,
changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock
options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings.

•

Stock-based compensation.

We implemented Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-based Payment" ("FAS 123R") in 2006, and we expect stock-based compensation to increase until at least 2010, which
corresponds to our standard 4-year vesting term. Thereafter, new grants will be expensed over the vesting period, however, this expense may be offset by fully vested grants that are no
longer expensed. For the years



ended

Total net revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of increased growth in our international Invisalign revenue and our North
American GP revenue.

Net
revenues from our North American Invisalign orthodontic channel decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to decreased case volume and higher revenue deferrals related to new products
introduced in 2008 partially offset by lower participation in volume-based discount program rebates. Net revenues from our North American Invisalign GP channel increased due to higher case
volume and lower participation in volume-based discount rebate programs.

Revenues
from both our North American orthodontic and GP channels increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of an overall increase in case volume and a favorable
product mix shift towards Invisalign Full. This product mix shift towards Invisalign Full began in the fourth quarter of 2006 after we removed the cancellation fees on Invisalign Full cases prior to
ClinCheck approval and clarified clinical protocols surrounding what is an appropriate Invisalign Express case. The increase in Invisalign Full revenues is partially offset by increased participation
in our volume-based discount programs.

The
increase in our international Invisalign revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 was predominantly due to higher case volumes partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates and increased
participation in volume-based discount programs.

The
increase in our international Invisalign revenues in 2007 compared to 2006 was attributable to an increase in case volume. Additionally, our international revenues benefited from
favorable exchange rates in 2007. These increases were partially offset by increased participation in volume-based discount programs.

Other
revenues, consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products, were lower in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to North American training discount programs. Other
revenues were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of an increased number of doctors trained year over year.

For
2009, we expect our total net revenues to decrease compared to 2008 primarily due to case volume decreases in North America partially offset by expected growth in international
revenue. We expect our mix of products to continue to shift in 2009 due to the introduction of new products during the second half of 2008. These new products have a significantly higher amount of
deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling price compared to Invisalign Full.

Cost
of revenues includes salaries for staff involved in the production process, costs incurred by IMS, a third party shelter service provider in Juarez, Mexico, the cost of materials,
packaging, shipping costs, depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process, training costs and stock-based compensation expense.

Gross
margin improved in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure and improved operating efficiencies.

Gross
margin improved in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of increased case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure resulting in decreases in our per unit standard
cost. Additionally,



cost
reductions from improved operating efficiencies also contributed to the increase in 2007 gross margin.

We
believe that gross margin in 2009 will be slightly lower than in 2008 as we expect overall case volume to decrease year over year partially offset by a benefit from our transition
from a third party shelter arrangement to direct manufacturing in Juarez, Mexico effective April 2009. However, with our relatively fixed manufacturing cost structure, quarterly gross margin will
fluctuate based on case volume and product mix. In addition, should we experience continuing unfavorable exchange rates, our gross margin may be adversely affected.

Sales

Sales
and marketing expense increased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher payroll-related expenses of $7.0 million, including stock-based compensation of
$1.1 million, as a result of the full year effect of additional headcount hired in the fourth quarter of 2007. We also incurred higher product marketing expenses of $9.0 million,
associated with our new product launches and commercialization, professional marketing programs, clinical education and media costs.

Our
sales and marketing expense increased during 2007 compared to 2006 predominantly as a result of a $10.3 million increase in media, advertising and product marketing expenses
and an increase in payroll-related expenses of $5.1 million, of which $3.7 million was attributable to additional headcount and $1.4 million to stock-based compensation.

We
expect sales and marketing expense levels in 2009 to be comparable to 2008. In 2009, we expect to invest in our international channel, including consumer advertising and sales force
expansion, and continue commercialization of new products in North America, offset by benefits from the transition of our shared services organizations to Costa Rica, beginning in the second half of
2009.

General
and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel, outside consulting services, legal expenses and stock-based compensation expense.

General
and administrative expenses increased during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to higher payroll-related expenses of $4.5 million, including increased stock-based
compensation expense of $2.6 million, resulting from additional headcount. Management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management
resulting in an asset impairment charge of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, legal and other professional fees were



higher
by $3.4 million compared to 2007 primarily due to a $1.6 million credit in 2007 from an insurance reimbursement we received associated with the OrthoClear litigation.

General
and administrative expense decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 largely due to a $20.6 million decline in external legal fees following the settlement of the OrthoClear
litigation in the fourth quarter of 2006. As mentioned above, our 2007 legal expense included a $1.6 million credit for an insurance reimbursement of legal costs also associated with the
OrthoClear litigation. This decrease was partially offset by a $3.5 million increase in additional headcount and incentive compensation, a $1.7 million increase in consulting fees, and a
$1.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, amortization expense increased $2.2 million in 2007 compared to 2006 related to the amortization of the
non-compete agreements we received in connection with the OrthoClear settlement.

We
expect general and administrative expense in 2009 to be lower than 2008 levels as we begin to benefit from the transition of our shared services organizations to Costa Rica, beginning
in the second half of 2009.

a result of increased headcount in the first half of 2008, partially offset by lower consulting fees.

Research
and development expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 predominantly from a $5.0 million increase resulting from higher headcount and incentive compensation.
Additionally, a $1.5 million increase in outside services also contributed to the increase in 2007 research and development costs.

We
expect research and development expense in 2009 to be lower than 2008 levels as a result of lower headcount and reduced consulting expenses.

During
2008, we announced restructuring plans in July and October to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the overall cost structure. In July 2008, we implemented a
restructuring plan to reduce our full time headcount by 67 employees including a phased-consolidation of order acquisition operations from our corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California to

care, accounts



receivable,
credit and collections, and customer event registration organizations in Santa Clara, California to our existing facilities in Costa Rica.

In
2008, we incurred approximately $6.2 million in restructuring expenses relating to these actions which includes $0.7 million related to the acceleration of stock option
vesting and $5.5 million related to severance and termination benefits, of which $3.0 million was paid during the year.

We
are phasing in the relocation to Costa Rica of our shared services group in an attempt to minimize disruptions to customer service levels and expect the relocation to be completed by
July 2009. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $1.8 million during the first half of 2009.

As
part of the OrthoClear Agreement in October 2006, OrthoClear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the United States and discontinue all aligner business operations
worldwide. As a result, most OrthoClear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with OrthoClear. In an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the OrthoClear patients
and their doctors, we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the "Patients First Program". In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded an
$8.3 million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program. Subsequently, in the first quarter of 2007, we reduced our Patients First
Program accrual by $1.8 million to reflect a reduction of our initial estimate to the number of cases actually received by the case submission deadline. We shipped all Patients First Program
cases by June 30, 2007.

We
paid $20.0 million to OrthoClear during the fourth quarter of 2006 in accordance with the terms of the OrthoClear Agreement, of which $14.0 million was capitalized on
our balance sheet representing the fair value of the non-compete agreements and is being amortized over 5 years. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 04-01
"Accounting for Pre-existing Contractual Relationships between the Parties to a Purchase Business Combination" ("EITF 04-01"), we recorded the remaining
$6.0 million as settlement costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.

Interest and other income (expense), net, includes interest income earned on cash balances, interest expense on debt, foreign currency translation gains and
losses and other miscellaneous charges.

Interest
income, net in 2008 decreased by $1.1 million compared to 2007 primarily due to lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances resulting from the
$50.0 million stock repurchase program and lower interest rates. In 2008, we shifted our investments into more conservative instruments principally, U.S. government securities, which bear lower
interest rates. We incurred no interest expense in 2008 compared to 2007. In 2007 we incurred interest expense on the outstanding balance of our line of credit during 2007 which was repaid during
2007. We had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2008.

Other
income (expense), net, increased in 2008 compared to 2007 reflecting increases in foreign currency translation losses.

Interest
income, net increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2007.

Other
income (expense), net, decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 reflecting the decrease in foreign currency translation gains. In January 2007, we began to record the adjustments from
translating certain European subsidiaries' financial statements from the local currency into the U.S. dollar as a separate component of shareholders' equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See

We
recorded an income tax benefit of $63.0 million for 2008 and income tax provisions of $1.2 million and $0.8 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. These
represented effective tax rates of (368.4)%, 3.3%, and (2.4)%, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which
we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction. We exercised significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth, forecasted earnings and projected
taxable income, in determining the provision for income taxes, and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future benefit from deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2008, based on
available positive evidence, we determined that most of our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as we cannot
forecast sufficient future capital gains or foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets. Therefore, we recorded a tax valuation allowance release of $64.6 million in 2008. The
remaining valuation allowance of approximately $6.2 million relating to capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2008, will result in an income tax
benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized.

At
December 31, 2008, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $191.1 million for federal tax purposes and $68.1 million for California state tax
purposes. If not utilized, these carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020 for federal purposes and 2010 for California purposes. FAS 123R prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset
for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable. Such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled $7.5 million
as of December 31, 2008 and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital, if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes



payable.
The Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation's tax attributes if a corporation undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes. If an ownership change is
determined to have occurred, our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation. However, based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses
at December 31, 2008 and our current estimate of the annual limitation, we do not expect our net operating loss carryforwards to be limited. At December 31, 2008, we had research credit
carryforwards of approximately $3.5 million for federal purposes and $4.3 million for California state tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal credit carryforwards will begin to
expire in 2017. The California state credit can be carried forward indefinitely.

We
have not provided additional U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings from non- U.S. operations as of December 31, 2008 because such earnings are intended to be
reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We fund our operations from product sales, the proceeds of the sale of our common stock, and from occasional borrowings under our
available credit facility. As of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we had the following cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments:

Net
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $39.7 million, resulting primarily from our net profit of $80.0 million and
non-cash items totaling $32.7 million, which included depreciation, amortization of intangibles, option acceleration charges for terminated executives and stock-based compensation
expense. Also included in non-cash items was an asset impairment charge of $1.7 million relating to management's decision to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for
business process management. These increases were offset by the release of a non-cash tax valuation allowance of $64.6 million on most of the deferred tax assets. Cash flows from
operating activities also resulted from a $4.6 million increase in deferred revenue and a $0.9 million decrease in inventories. These increases in cash flows were offset by an $8.0
increase in accounts receivable and a decrease of $6.1 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Net
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $52.8 million, resulting primarily from our net income of $35.7 million and
non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and amortization of intangibles totaling $25.6 million. Additionally, a $2.7 million increase
in accounts payable also contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities. These increases in cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by a
$10.7 million increase in accounts receivable.

Net
cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $14.0 million, resulting primarily from our net loss of $35.0 million and
non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and amortization of intangibles totaling $19.2 million. Additionally, a $6.4 million increase
in current assets and a $5.8 million reduction in deferred revenue partially offset by a $14.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the cash
used in operating activities. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to the



$6.8 million
accrual as of December 31, 2006 for the anticipated costs of completing the Patients First Program.

Net
cash used in investing activities was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and consisted of $14.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment
offset by $12.9 million of net maturities of marketable securities. As a result of current adverse financial market conditions, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising
from liquidity and credit concerns. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can
provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired.

Net
cash used in investing activities was $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, which largely consisted of $29.9 million of net purchases of
short-term marketable securities and $7.4 million used for the purchase of capital assets.

Net
cash used in investing activities was $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to a $14.0 million purchase of intangible assets
resulting from the OrthoClear Agreement, $10.0 million for the purchase of capital assets and $8.9 million for net purchases of short-term marketable securities.

Net
cash used in financing activities was $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and resulted primarily from our $50.1 million stock repurchase including
commissions offset by $10.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, principally from exercises of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and consisted of $29.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our
common stock, primarily from exercises of employee stock options. This increase was partially offset by the repayment of $11.5 million against the outstanding balance on our line of credit. Net
cash provided by financing activities was $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and consisted of $16.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock,
primarily from exercises of employee stock options and $11.5 million in net borrowings from our line of credit.

Net
proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity. However, in 2006, we
began granting restricted stock units ("RSUs") which, unlike stock options, do not generate cash from exercise. As a result, we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our
common stock in future periods. In addition, because RSUs are taxable to the individuals when they vest, the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable
withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf. During 2008 and 2007, we paid $0.5 million and $0.4 million of taxes related to RSUs that vested during the period for
executive officers.

On
December 5, 2008, we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with Comerica Bank. Under this revolving line of credit, we have $25.0 million of available
borrowings with a maturity date of December 31, 2010. This credit facility requires a quick ratio covenant and also requires us to maintain
a minimum unrestricted cash balance of $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had no outstanding borrowings and we were in compliance with the financial covenant of this credit
facility.

On
April 29, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program of up to $50 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we
repurchased 4.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of $10.76 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $50.1 million including commissions. As of December 31,
2008, we had completed repurchases under the stock repurchase authorization.

In
July 2008, we entered into an agreement in favor of and for the benefit of Elamex de Juarez, S.A. DE C.V., or Elamex, landlord to IMS, our third party shelter services
provider. Under this agreement, we guarantee IMS' lease payments for its facility located in Juarez, Mexico. The monthly rent for this 68,000 square foot facility is $30,000 and the lease expires in
July 2013. Pursuant to the guarantee, we are obligated to pay Elamex for any rental payments in default by IMS. During the year ended December 31, 2008, there were no rental payment defaults by
IMS.

On
December 22, 2008, we notified IMS of our intention to terminate IMS' shelter services arrangement effective April 2009. At that time, we will become a direct manufacturer of
our clear aligners at the facility in Juarez, Mexico and we will also assume IMS' lease with Elamex.

We
had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a) (4) as of December 31, 2008.

We
believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. If
we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows, we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with other companies,
bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on
terms acceptable to us, or at all. If
adequate funds are not available, we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy, business structure or
operations. Accordingly, the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements requires our management to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an
on-going basis, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation and income taxes. We use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions
as the basis for making estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.



Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 "Revenue Recognition" ("SAB 104"), and
Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 00-21 "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables" ("EITF 00-21"). SAB 104 requires that four basic criteria
must be met before revenue can be recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Revenues
are recognized from product sales, net of discounts and rebates. Service revenues related to the training of dental professionals and staff on the Invisalign treatment process
are recorded when the services are completed.

We
enter into arrangements that involve multiple product deliveries in the future. Included in the price of Invisalign Full, Invisalign Teen and Invisalign Assist, we offer case
refinement, which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient's teeth to the desired final position. Case refinement may be elected by the dental professional in the last stages of orthodontic
treatment. We use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement deliverable and recognize the residual revenue upon shipment. We defer the fair value of
case refinement upon shipment based on a breakage factor, which is determined by sufficient historical experience of case refinement utilization. We believe that the use of a breakage factor is
reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of case refinement utilization since case refinement was first offered. Actual utilization rates could differ from the historical breakage
factor requiring future adjustments to revenue.

Revenues
are deferred for certain products that include staged delivery. Depending on the product, revenues are recognized based on usage, case completion, ratably over a delivery period
or upon shipment of the final staged shipment. Revenue for the six replacement aligners included in Invisalign Teen is deferred based on the fair market value until the earlier of replacement aligners
being used or until the case is completed. The Vivera retainer includes four shipments per year, and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and recognized ratably over the one year delivery
period. For Invisalign Assist, when the progress tracking feature is selected, aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages. For these cases, revenue is deferred upon the
first staged shipment and will be recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment.

We
estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales, if any, in the period such sales occur. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in
the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates.

Stock-based Compensation Expense

We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 123 (revised 2004),
"Share-Based Payment" ("FAS 123R") in 2006. Accordingly, we recognize compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period of the award, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.
Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The assumptions used
in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a
result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Prior to FAS 123R adoption, we accounted for
share-based payment awards under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to



Employees"
("APB 25") and its related interpretations.

See Note 10 "Stockholders' Equity" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

Long-lived assets, including finite lived purchased intangible assets

Long-lived assets, including intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives, unless these
lives are determined to be indefinite. Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("FAS 144"). We perform an impairment test whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or
projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant
decline in our stock price for a sustained period. Impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value, and fair value is generally measured
based on discounted cash flow analyses. Management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset impairment charge of
$1.7 million which was recorded in general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2008. No intangible asset impairment was recorded for the periods presented.

Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance

We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated
with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the fourth quarter of 2008, with the exception of
certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, we determined that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would be realized. Accordingly, we released the tax valuation
allowance on most of the deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of $64.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

As
of December 31, 2008, we believed that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be realized. However, should there be a change in our
ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a
full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our
financial position and results of operations.

Interest Rate Risk

Changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable
securities. Our cash equivalents and investments are in fixed-rate, short-term securities. Fixed-rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted
due to a rise in interest rates, and as a result, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to



changes
in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, we had
$23.1 million invested in available-for-sale marketable securities. An immediate 10% increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future
operating results and cash flows.

We
do not have interest bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2008 and therefore, we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases.

Currency Rate Risk

We operate in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Costa Rica and Japan. As a result of our international business
activities, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets, and there is no assurance that exchange
rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future. We sell our products in the local currency for the respective country. This provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries'
operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below. Regardless of this natural hedging, our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate
fluctuation. Although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations, and, where appropriate, may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these
fluctuations, we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions. The impact of an aggregate decline of 10% in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar on our
results of operations and financial position could be material.

Prior
to January 1, 2007, the functional currency of Align and our subsidiaries was the U.S. dollar, and accordingly, gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in Euros, Costa Rican Colones, and other currencies were reflected in other income (expense). During the first quarter of 2007, we analyzed the various economic
factors of our international subsidiaries in accordance with FAS 52 and determined that there had been a significant change in facts and circumstances to warrant a change in the functional
currency for some of our European subsidiaries from the U.S. dollar to the local currency. Effective January 1, 2007, the adjustment from translating certain European subsidiaries' financial
statements from the local currency into the U.S. dollar was recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net in the stockholder's equity section of our Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Align is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Align's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of Align's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based
on its assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, Align's internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Align Technology, Inc. and subsidiaries:

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index under item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Align
Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index appearing under item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business Description

Align Technology, Inc. ("Align" or the "Company") was incorporated in April 1997 and designs, manufactures and markets the
Invisalign system, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that
gently move teeth to a desired final position.

Basis of presentation and preparation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of
intercompany transactions and balances.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates.

Fair value of financial instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities
approximate the fair value.

Cash equivalents and marketable securities

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. The Company invests
primarily in money market funds, commercial paper, and United States government securities, accordingly, these investments are subject to minimal credit and market risks.

Marketable
securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Marketable securities classified as current assets have maturities of
less than one year. Unrealized gains or losses on such securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from maturities of
all such securities are reported in earnings and computed using the specific identification cost method. Realized gains or losses and charges for other-than-temporary declines
in value, if any, on available-for-sale securities are reported in other income (expense) as incurred. The Company periodically evaluates these investments for
other-than-temporary impairment.

The
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 ("FAS"), "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), for measuring its cash equivalents
and marketable securities effective January 1, 2008. FAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The
Company also adopted FAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FAS No. 115"
("FAS 159"). FAS 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. Under
FAS 159, a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities,
equity method investments, accounts payable, guarantees and issued debt. Other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and
non-cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services. If the use of fair value is elected, any upfront costs and fees
related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred, e.g., debt issue costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an
instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses
on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of FAS 159, changes in fair value are
recognized in earnings. The adoption of FAS 159 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as the fair value option was
not elected for any of the Company's financial assets or financial liabilities at the date of adoption.

Restricted cash

The Company's restricted cash as of December 31, 2007 was $21,000 and was primarily comprised of a security deposit for a
leasing arrangement in Europe. There was no restricted cash balance as of December 31, 2008.

Foreign currency

The Company accounts for both the translation and remeasurement of balance sheet and income statement items into the U.S. dollar in
accordance with FAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation" ("FAS 52"). The Company analyzes the functional currency for each of its
international subsidiaries on an annual basis, or more often if necessary, to determine if a significant change in facts and circumstances indicate that the primary economic currency has changed.

During
the first quarter of 2007, the Company analyzed the various economic factors of its international subsidiaries in accordance with FAS 52 and determined that there had been
a significant change in facts and circumstances to warrant a change in the functional currency for some of its European subsidiaries from the U.S. dollar to the local currency. Effective
January 1, 2007, the adjustment from translating certain European subsidiaries' financial statements from the local currency to the U.S. dollar was recorded as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the stockholders' equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This foreign currency translation adjustment reflects the translation of the
balance sheet at period end exchange rates, and the income statement at an average exchange rate in effect during the period. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had
$0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net related to the translation of its foreign subsidiaries' financial statements. See

Note 15 "Comprehensive Income
(Loss)"

for additional disclosures.

Align's
other international entities operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment, and therefore, the foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into the U.S.
dollar at current



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

exchange
rates except for non-monetary assets and liabilities which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are generally remeasured at an average exchange rate
in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income (expense). Prior to January 1, 2007, all of Align's subsidiaries used the U.S.
dollar as its functional currency, and accordingly, gains and losses resulting from remeasurement were included in other income (expense).

For
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company included in other income (expense) a loss of $0.4 million, a loss of $0.1 million and a gain of
$1.1 million, respectively.

Certain risks and uncertainties

The Company's operating results depend to a significant extent on the Company's ability to market and develop its products. The life
cycles of the Company's products are difficult to estimate due in part to the effect of future product enhancements and competition. The inability of the Company to successfully develop and market its
products as a result of competition or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

Financial
instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The
Company invests excess cash primarily in money market funds of major financial institutions, commercial paper and notes and government securities. If the carrying value of the Company's investments
exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company will be required to write down the value of its investments, which could
materially harm the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the performance of certain securities in the Company's investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition
of the U.S. financial sector. With the current unstable credit environment, the Company might incur significant realized, unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments. The Company
provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable, but ongoing evaluations of customers' credit worthiness are performed. The Company
maintains reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been within management's expectations. No individual customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company's accounts receivable at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, or net revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

In
the United States of America, the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulates the design, manufacture, distribution, preclinical and clinical study, clearance and approval of
medical devices. Products developed by the Company may require approvals or clearances from the FDA or other international regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales. There can be no assurance
that the Company's products will receive any of the required approvals or clearances. If the Company was denied approval or clearance or such approval was delayed, it may have a material adverse
impact on the Company.

The
Company has manufacturing operations located outside the United States of America. The Company currently relies on its manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica to prepare digital
treatment plans using a sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program. In addition, the Company relies on a third party shelter services provider in Juarez, Mexico to fabricate
aligners and to ship the completed product to the Company's customers. On December 22, 2008, the Company announced the termination of its shelter services arrangement with the third party
shelter services



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

provider
effective April 1, 2009. At that time, the Company will become a direct, independent manufacturer of its clear aligners at the facility in Juarez, Mexico. The Company's reliance on
international operations exposes it to related risks and uncertainties, including difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; difficulties in managing the transition from a third
party shelter services arrangement to becoming an independent manufacturer, including difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified personnel; controlling production volume and quality of
manufacture; political, social and economic instability, including as a result of increased levels of violence in Juarez, Mexico; interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services; product
and material transportation delays or disruption; trade restrictions and changes in tariffs; import and export license requirements and restrictions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
and potential adverse tax consequences. If any of these risks materialize, the Company's international manufacturing operations, as well as its operating results, may be harmed.

The
Company purchases certain inventory from sole suppliers. Additionally, the Company relies on a limited number of hardware manufacturers. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer
to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could materially and adversely impact future operating results.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon sale or retirement, the asset's cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
general ledger and any related gains or losses are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

The
Company evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment in accordance with FAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets"
("FAS 144"), whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or circumstances
include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its business,
significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in our stock price for sustained period. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it
exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset. The Company also compares the carrying amount of the asset to its fair
market value in accordance with FAS 157. FAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. In the event that the projected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the assets are written down to
their estimated fair values. The Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $1.7 million in connection with an internally developed software in fourth quarter of 2008. See Note 4
"

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets"

for additional information.



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Development costs for internal use software

Costs relating to internal use software are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 98-1,
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" ("SOP 98-1"). As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, capitalized internal use software at
cost was $5.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The associated accumulated amortization was $4.7 million and $4.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of three years.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets
acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The Company completed
its annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2008 and determined that there was no impairment.

Long-lived assets, including finite lived purchased intangible assets

Other intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets purchased as part of the OrthoClear Agreement. These assets are
amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to five years, reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be
realized.

The
Company performs an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or
circumstances
include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for its business,
significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company's stock price for a sustained period. Impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair
value of the asset and its carrying value, and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses. No intangible asset impairment was recorded for the periods presented.

Product Warranty

The Company warrants its products against material defects until the Invisalign cases are completed. The Company accrues for product
warranty in cost of revenues upon shipment of products. Product warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs.
Actual warranty costs could differ materially from the estimated amounts. The Company regularly reviews the accrued balances and updates these balances based on historical warranty cost trends. Actual
warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company's customers
to make payments. The Company periodically reviews these allowances, including an analysis of the customers' payment history and information regarding the



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

customers'
creditworthiness. Actual write-offs have not materially differed from the estimated allowance.

Revenue Recognition

Align recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 "Revenue Recognition" ("SAB 104"), and
Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 00-21 "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables"
("EITF 00-21"). SAB 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred,
the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Revenues
are recognized from product sales, net of discounts and rebates. Service revenues related to the training of dental professionals and staff on the Invisalign treatment process
are recorded when the services are completed.

Align
enters into arrangements that involve multiple product deliveries in the future. Included in the price of Invisalign Full, Invisalign Teen and Invisalign Assist, the Company offers
case refinement, which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient's teeth to the desired final position. Case refinement may be elected by the dental professional in the last stages of orthodontic
treatment. The Company uses vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement deliverable and recognizes the residual revenue upon shipment. Align defers the
fair value of case refinement upon shipment based on a breakage factor, which is determined by sufficient historical experience of case refinement utilization. The Company believes that the use of a
breakage factor is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of case refinement utilization since case refinement was first offered. Actual utilization rates could differ from the
historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue.

Revenues
are deferred for certain products that include staged delivery. Depending on the product, revenues are recognized based on usage, case completion, ratably over a subscription
period or upon shipment of the final staged shipment. Revenue for the six replacement aligners included in Invisalign Teen is deferred based on the fair market value until the earlier of replacement
aligners being used or until the case is completed. The Vivera retainer includes four shipments per year, and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and recognized as each shipment occurs. For
Invisalign Assist, when the progress tracking feature is selected, aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages. For these cases, revenue is deferred upon the first staged
shipment and will be recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment.

The
Company estimates and records a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales, if any, in the period such sales occur. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are
provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling charges to customers are included in net revenues, and the associated costs incurred are recorded in cost of
revenues for all periods presented.

Research and development

Advertising costs

The cost of advertising and media is expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 advertising
costs totaled $18.3 million, $15.9 million, and $9.2 million, respectively.

Income taxes

The Company estimates income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where business is conducted. Significant judgment is required in
determining the income tax provision. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred
tax assets and liabilities. The Company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent the Company believes that realization is not likely, it will
establish a valuation allowance.

On
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provision of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertain Income
Taxes—An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial
statements in accordance with FAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("FAS 109") and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure
of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under FIN 48, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount
that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less
than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure
and transition.

Stock-based compensation

The Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment"
("FAS 123R") in 2006. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period of the award, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the option's expected term
and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical
experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based
payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company
uses different assumptions, its stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Prior to FAS 123R adoption, the Company accounted for share-based payment awards
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and its related interpretations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("FAS 141R"). FAS 141R
establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date. FAS 141R determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to
evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141R applies prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The
Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of FAS 141R on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No.160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements" ("FAS 160"), an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" ("ARB 51"). FAS 160 changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests,
which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. This new consolidation method significantly changes the accounting for transactions with minority
interest holders. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company plans to adopt FAS 160 beginning in the first quarter of 2009. The Company
is evaluating the impact the adoption of FAS 160 will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In
April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 142-3, "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets" ("FSP FAS 142-3"). FSP
FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FAS
No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." FSP FAS No. 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The guidance for determining the
useful life of an intangible asset must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of FSP
FAS No. 142-3 on its consolidated financial statements.

In
August 2008, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that they will issue for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by U.S. issuers of financial
statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). IFRS is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the International Accounting Standards
Board ("IASB"). Under the proposed roadmap, the Company could be required in fiscal 2014 to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and the SEC will make a determination in 2011
regarding the mandatory adoption of IFRS. The Company will assess the impact that this potential change would have on its consolidated financial statements and will monitor the development of the
potential implementation of IFRS.

Note 2. Marketable Securities and Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

Fair Value Measurements

The Company adopted the provisions of FAS 157 for measuring its cash equivalents and marketable securities effective
January 1, 2008. FAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. FAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires an
entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. FAS 157 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure
fair value:

Level 1—

Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

The
Company's Level 1 assets and liabilities consist of U.S. government debt securities and money market funds.

Level 2

—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

The
Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of agency bonds and discount notes, corporate bonds and certificates of deposit and commercial paper.

Level 3

—Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that
are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing
models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.

The
Company did not hold any Level 3 assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Note 4. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment in accordance with FAS 144 whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a
long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The Company's management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset
impairment charge of $1.7 million which was recorded in general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment indicators which management considered included the fact
that this internally developed software tool was not completed and as no market participant would be
willing to purchase an unfinished customized application, the fair value was determined to be zero, and the fully capitalized amount of the software tool was written off consistent with the related
provisions of FAS 144 and FAS 157.

Note 5. Patients First Program and settlement costs

In October 2006, the Company entered into a formal agreement with OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear Holdings, Inc., and OrthoClear Pakistan Pvt. Ltd. ("OrthoClear"),
together with certain individuals associated with OrthoClear (the "OrthoClear Agreement") to end all pending litigation between the parties. In addition, OrthoClear agreed to stop the importation of
aligners into the United States and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide. As a result, most OrthoClear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with OrthoClear.
OrthoClear also agreed to assign and transfer to Align all intellectual property rights with application to the correction of malocclusion and certain OrthoClear principals also signed five year
non-compete agreements. The Company evaluated this transaction under the provisions of EITF No. 98-3 "Determining Whether a Non-Monetary Transaction Involves
a Receipt of Productive Assets or of a Business" ("EITF 98-3") and concluded that this transaction was not a business acquisition and was accounted for as an asset purchase.

In
an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the OrthoClear patients and their doctors, the Company committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional
cost under the "Patients First Program". In 2006, the Company recorded an $8.3 million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program. Subsequently, in the first quarter of 2007,
the Company reduced its Patients First Program accrual by $1.8 million to reflect a reduction of its initial estimate of the number of cases actually received by the case submission deadline.
During 2007, the Company shipped virtually all Patients First Program cases. The accrued Patients First Program balance as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $0.1 million and
$1.0 million, respectively, and principally consisted of estimated future warranty and case refinement costs.

The
Company paid $20.0 million to OrthoClear during 2006 in accordance with the terms of the OrthoClear Agreement, of which $14.0 million was capitalized on the Company's
balance sheet representing the fair value of the non-compete agreements and is being amortized over
5 years. The Company recorded the remaining $6.0 million as settlement costs in 2006 in accordance with EITF No. 04-01 "Accounting for Pre-existing
Contractual Relationships between the Parties to a Purchase Business Combination" ("EITF 04-01").

On January 6, 2003, Ormco Corporation ("Ormco"), a division of Sybron Dental Specialties (a Danaher Corporation subsidiary),
filed suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Central District, Orange County Division, asserting infringement of certain patents. The complaint sought unspecified
monetary damages and injunctive relief. On February 18, 2003, the Company answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity and
non-infringement of the asserted patents. In addition, the Company counterclaimed for infringement of one of its patents, seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. Ormco
filed a reply to its counterclaims on March 10, 2003 and asserted counterclaims against the Company seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity and non-infringement of the
patent.

Note 7. Legal Proceedings (Continued)

There
have been two appeals. After the permanent injunction was entered, Ormco and Allesee Orthodontic Appliances, Inc. ("AOA") appealed that injunction and the orders of the
District Court on summary judgment on which the injunction was based. Oral arguments took place on April 3, 2006. Following oral arguments, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
("CAFC") issued a ruling declaring two out of a total of seventy-one claims in the Company's US Patent No. 6,398,548 and four out of a total of ten claims in US Patent
No. 6,554,611 to be invalid as "obvious." The CAFC's decision reverses the California District Court summary judgment order of validity.

The
second appeal was from the final judgment. Ormco appealed the ruling of the District Court that 92 claims in four of its patents are not infringed by the Company and that the
asserted claims are invalid. Align appealed the ruling of the District Court that certain claims of its 6,398,548 patent which were found to be infringed by Ormco's and AOA's Red, White & Blue
appliances were invalid. The CAFC issued a ruling on August 24, 2007, affirming the District Court's ruling that 86 out of 92 claims in the four asserted Ormco patents are invalid and not
infringed by Align. The CAFC reversed the District Court's non-infringement rulings on six claims in Ormco's 6,616,444 patent.

Ormco
has filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court asking for an extension of time in which to file a petition for review by the U.S. Supreme Court with respect to the portion
of the CAFC's opinion that affirmed the District Court's ruling of non-infringement and non-enablement of the 86 claims. The Supreme Court denied Ormco's petition, and the case
on the six claims in Ormco's patent were returned to the District Court for a determination of validity and infringement of those claims. The District Court issued orders construing the claim terms at
issue and granting the Company's motion to amend its answer and counterclaim to assert Ormco's patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. The parties are currently conducting discovery. Trial
on liability issues is scheduled for June 2, 2009.

On
February 25, 2009, the District Court issued rulings on various Summary Judgment and expert related motions. In summary, the District Court granted one of Ormco's motions on
one theory of infringement and granted the Company's motion on two theories of non-infringement. The Company's invalidity argument supported by over fifty prior art references was unaffected. The
District Court also ruled that one of the Company's inequitable conduct theories should be resolved at trial. A finding of inequitable conduct at trial could render the six claims at issue and
possibly the family of Ormco patents related to the 6,616,444 patent unenforceable.

Trial
on liability issues is scheduled for June 2, 2009. Despite the District Court's ruling of infringement on one of Ormco's theories, if the jury finds Ormco's six claims to be
invalid or unenforceable, there can be no liability for infringement. The Company intends to vigorously pursue its invalidity and inequitable conduct counterclaims at trial.

Class Action

On May 18, 2007, Debra A. Weber filed a consumer class action lawsuit against Align, OrthoClear, Inc. and OrthoClear
Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a OrthoClear, Inc.) in Syracuse, New York, U.S. District Court. The complaint alleges two causes of action against the OrthoClear defendants and one cause of action
against Align for breach of contract. The cause of action against the Company, titled "Breach of Third Party Benefit Contract" references Align's agreement to make Invisalign treatment available to
OrthoClear patients, alleging that the Company failed "to provide the promised treatment to Plaintiff or any of the class members".

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 7. Legal Proceedings (Continued)

On
July 3, 2007, the Company filed an answer to the complaint and asserted 17 affirmative defenses. On July 20, 2007, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment on the
Third Cause of Action (the only cause of action alleged against Align). On August 24, 2007, Weber filed a motion for class certification. On October 1, 2007, the Company filed an
opposition to the motion for class certification and it is currently awaiting rulings from the Court. OrthoClear has filed a motion to dismiss. The initial case management conference and all discovery
has been stayed pending the Court's decision on the motion for class certification, OrthoClear's motion to dismiss and the Company's motion for summary judgment.

Litigating
claims of these types, whether or not ultimately determined in the Company's favor or settled by the Company, are costly and divert the efforts and attention of the Company's
management and technical personnel from normal business operations. Any of these results from litigation could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. From time to time, the Company has
received, and may again receive, letters from third parties drawing the Company's attention to their patent rights. While the Company does not believe that it infringes any such rights that have been
brought to the Company's attention, there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which the Company is presently unaware.

Note 8. Credit Facilities

On December 5, 2008, the Company renegotiated and amended its existing credit facility with Comerica Bank. Under this revolving line of credit, the Company has
$25.0 million of available borrowings with a maturity date of December 31, 2010. This credit facility requires a quick ratio covenant and also requires the Company to maintain a minimum
unrestricted cash balance of $10.0 million. The interest rate on borrowings will range from Libor plus 1.5% to 2.0% depending upon the amount of unrestricted cash the Company maintains at
Comerica Bank above the $10.0 million minimum.

As
of December 31, 2008, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and is in compliance with the financial covenant.

Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies

Operating leases

Align rents its facilities and certain equipment and automobiles under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements.
Facility leases expire at various dates through 2013 and provide for pre-negotiated fixed rental rates during the terms of the lease.

In
February 2005, the Company renewed its Santa Clara headquarters lease allowing it to utilize the security deposit of $1.3 million paid at the inception of the lease on
July 1, 2000, to reduce the monthly rent payment by $11,000. By the end of the lease term on June 30, 2010, the security deposit balance will be reduced to $0.6 million.

The
Company has a facility in San Jose, Costa Rica. The facility comprises approximately 63,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space. The monthly rent for the Costa Rica
facility is approximately $78,000. The Company renewed the lease in March 2008 for an additional five year term, which commenced in October 2008 and expires in September 2013.

The
Company's European headquarters are located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. On August 3, 2007, the original lease agreement was amended to expand its Amsterdam facility to
approximately

$125,000. The monthly rent for the Amsterdam facility is approximately $48,000.

The
Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period, and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Total rent expense was
$3.8 million, $3.4 million, and $3.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

monthly rent for this 68,000 square foot facility is $30,000 and the lease expires in July 2013. Pursuant to the guarantee, the Company is obligated to pay Elamex for any rental payments in default by
IMS. During the year ended December 31, 2008, there were no rental payment defaults by IMS. On December 22, 2008, the Company notified IMS of its intention to terminate IMS' shelter
services arrangement effective April 2009. At that time, the Company will become a direct manufacturer of its clear aligners at the facility in Juarez, Mexico, and the Company will also assume IMS'
lease with Elamex.

Note 10. Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock Rights Agreement

The Preferred Stock Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") is intended to protect stockholders from unfair or coercive takeover
practices. In accordance with the Rights Agreement, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of Align's
common stock to stockholders of record on November 22, 2005. Each Right entitles stockholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share of Align's Series A Participating Preferred
Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at an exercise price of $37.00, subject to adjustment. Rights will become exercisable in certain circumstances, including upon a person or group acquiring or
announcing the intention to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then outstanding common stock without the approval of the Board of Directors. Each holder of a Right will have the right
to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock having a value equal to two times the purchase price. The Rights will expire on November 22, 2015 or upon the exercise of the Rights, whichever
occurs earlier.

Common Stock

The holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available and when and if declared by the
Board of Directors. The Company has never declared or paid dividends on its common stock.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Align's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan") consists of overlapping twenty-four month offering periods with
four six-month purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares at 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at either the beginning of the purchase period or the
end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower. The Purchase Plan provides that the number of shares of the Company's common stock reserved for issuance thereunder will automatically increase on
the first trading day of January in each calendar year by an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last trading day in December of the
immediately preceding calendar year, with this annual increase not to exceed 1,500,000 shares. The maximum number of shares that can be granted under the Purchase Plan in any one year is 800,000
shares of common stock.

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, 522,829 shares were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had reserved 11,933,456 shares of common
stock for future issuance and 9,169,883 shares remain available for future issuance.

As
of December 31, 2008, there was $2.6 million of total unamortized compensation costs related to employee stock purchases. These costs are expected to be recognized over
a weighted average period of 0.6 years.

Stock Option Plans

In May 2005, the 2005 Incentive plan ("2005 Plan") replaced the 2001 stock incentive Plan ("2001 Plan"). The 2005 Plan, which expires
December 31, 2010, provides for the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units and
performance shares. Employees, non-employee directors and consultants are eligible to receive grants under the 2005
Plan. The options are granted for periods not exceeding ten years and generally vest over 4 years with 25% vesting one year from the date of grant and 1/48

th

each month
thereafter. The Plan Administrator may, however, grant options with different vesting schedules.

In
2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the grant of restricted stock units (contracts that give the recipients the right to receive shares as the units
vest) to its employees and director(s) in addition to stock options. Each restricted stock unit award generally vests over 4 years with 25% on the one year anniversary of the date of grant and
6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Each grant of a restricted stock unit will reduce shares available for grant by 2 shares. In October 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
approved a change in vesting for prospective grants of restricted stock units to 25% annually.

The
2005 Plan has 9,983,379 shares of the Company's common stock reserved for issuance, plus up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares that have been or will be returned to the 2001 Plan as
a result of termination of outstanding options or repurchase of shares granted under the 2001 Plan on or after March 28, 2005. As of December 31, 2008, 2,311,367 shares have been
transferred to and 4,035,602 shares remain available for issuance under the 2005 Plan.

Executive Grants

In January 2001, the stockholders approved two option grants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise
price of $15.00 per share to each of the Company's then Chief Executive Officer and President. The options were granted outside of the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan and prior to the adoption of the 2001
Plan or the 2005 Plan. As of January 1, 2006, 1,500,000 shares had been cancelled. The remaining 500,000 shares were cancelled in May 2006. As of December 31, 2008, no options to
purchase shares of common stock were outstanding under these grants.

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (calculated by using Align's closing stock price on the last trading day of 2008
multiplied by the number of non-vested RSUs) that would have been received by the unit holders had all RSUs been vested and released on the last day of each fiscal year. This amount will
fluctuate based on the fair market value of Align's stock. During 2008, of the 258,318 shares vested and released, approximately 42,816 vested shares were withheld for executive RSU tax payments,
resulting in a net issuance of 215,502 shares.

The
total intrinsic value of RSUs vested and released during 2008 and 2007 was $2.9 million and $3.4 million. There were no RSUs vested and released during 2006. As of
December 31, 2008, there was $11.1 million of total unamortized compensation costs related to RSUs, and these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
2.5 years.

Stock-based compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004),
"Share-based Payment" ("FAS 123R") using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards
based on estimated fair values over the requisite service period. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our financial statements for the prior periods have not been restated
to reflect and do not include the impact of FAS 123R stock options.

Valuation assumptions

The fair value of stock options granted and the option component of the Purchase Plan shares were estimated at the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

The
expected term of stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. Upon the adoption of FAS 123R, the Company used a
mid-point model to determine the expected term of stock options based on the Company's historical exercise, post-vesting cancellation experience, and the remaining contractual
term of its outstanding options.



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 10. Stockholders' Equity (Continued)

For
the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company used its own historical volatility when determining the expected volatility. In 2006, the Company used a combination of
historical volatility and peer group volatility in deriving its expected volatility assumption as allowed under FAS 123R and SAB 107.

The
risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option.

The
dividend yield reflects that the Company has not paid any cash dividends since inception and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Summary of Stock-based Compensation Expense

Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and may be revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The stock-based compensation expense related to all of the Company's stock-based awards and employee stock purchases
under FAS 123R for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006 is as follows:

Note 11. Common Stock Repurchase Program

In April 2008, the Company's Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing management to repurchase up to $50 million of the Company's outstanding
common stock. Purchases under the program were made, from time to time, in the open market. During 2008, the Company purchased approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock at an average
price of $10.76 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $50.1 million including commissions and completed the stock repurchase program. The common stock repurchases reduced additional
paid-in capital by $38.6 million and increased accumulated deficit by $11.6 million. All repurchased shares were retired.

Note 12. Employee Benefit Plan

In January 1999, the Company adopted a defined contribution retirement plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers substantially all employees who
meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Company contributions to the plan may be made at the
discretion of

With
the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, the Company released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets and recorded
an income tax benefit of $64.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the Company believed, except for the items noted above, that the amount of
deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet will be realized. However, should there be a change in the Company's ability to recover its deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase in
the period in which it is more likely than not that the Company cannot recover its deferred tax assets.

At
December 31, 2008, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $191.1 million for federal purposes and $68.1 million for California state
tax purposes. If not utilized, these carryforwards will begin to expire beginning in 2020 for federal purposes and 2010 for California purposes.

The
Company has research credit carryforwards of approximately $3.5 million for federal purposes and $4.3 million for California state tax purposes. If not utilized, the
federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017. The California state credit can be carried forward indefinitely.

Effective
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"). This interpretation clarifies the
criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", and requires additional disclosures about uncertain tax positions. Under FIN 48,
the financial statement recognition



ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 13. Income Taxes (Continued)

of
the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority. If this
threshold is met, the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The
unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million include $0.3 million of uncertain tax positions that would impact the Company's effective tax rate if recognized. In
accordance with FIN 48, the Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxes. Interest and penalties are immaterial at the date of
adoption and are included in the unrecognized tax benefits.

The
Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various states and foreign jurisdictions. All of the Company's tax years will be open to examination by the U.S. federal and most state
tax authorities due to the Company's net operating loss and overall credit carryforward position. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to examination by foreign tax authorities for
years before 2004.

Note 14. Net Profit (Loss) per Share

Basic net profit (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock during the year less unvested common shares subject to repurchase. Diluted net
profit (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, adjusted for the dilutive effect of potential common stock. Potential common stock, computed using the
treasury stock method, includes options, restricted stock units, and the dilutive component of Purchase Plan shares.

Note 18. Restructurings

During 2008, the Company announced restructuring plans in July and October to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the overall cost structure. In July 2008, the
Company implemented a restructuring plan to reduce its full time headcount by 67 employees including a phased-consolidation of order acquisition operations from its corporate headquarters in Santa
Clara, California to Juarez, Mexico, which was completed by the end of 2008. The October restructuring plan included a total reduction of 111 full time headcount in Santa Clara, California by July
2009 as the Company moves its customer care, accounts receivable, credit and collections, and customer event registration organizations, in Santa Clara, California to existing facilities in Costa
Rica.

In
2008, the Company incurred approximately $6.2 million in restructuring expenses relating to these actions which included $0.7 million related to the acceleration of
stock option vesting and $5.5 million related to severance and termination benefits, of which $3.0 million was paid during the year.

The
Company anticipates phasing in the relocation to Costa Rica of its shared services group in an attempt to minimize disruptions to customer service levels and expect the relocation to
be completed by July 2009. The Company expects to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $1.8 million during the first half of 2009.

This
number reflects the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options and restricted stock units under the 1997 Equity Incentive
Plan, the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, and the 2005 Incentive Plan. The 871,777 restricted stock units included in this number have an exercise price of zero.



(2)

We
are unable to ascertain with specificity the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
or the weighted average exercise price of outstanding rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

(3)

This
number reflects securities available for future issuance under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In January 2001, all
outstanding options under the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan were subsumed under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. Since that date no options have been granted under the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan. In May
2005, stockholder approval was obtained for the 2005 Incentive Plan and the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan was terminated. Since that date, no further options have been granted under the 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan. The 2005 Incentive Plan has 9,983,379 shares of common stock reserved for issuance, plus up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares that are or would have been returned to the 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan as a result of termination of outstanding options or repurchase of shares granted under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan after March 28, 2005. As of December 31, 2008,
2,311,367 shares have been transferred to the 2005 Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2008, the number of shares available for future issuance under the 2005 Incentive Plan was 4,035,602. Any
grants of restricted stock units will reduce shares available for grant at a 2:1 ratio. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides that the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance
thereunder will automatically increase on the first trading day of January in each calendar year by an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on
the last trading day in December of the immediately preceding calendar year, with this annual increase not to exceed 1,500,000 shares. The maximum number of shares that can be granted under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan in any one year is 800,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2008, the total number of shares of our common stock available for future issuance under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan was 9,169,883.
