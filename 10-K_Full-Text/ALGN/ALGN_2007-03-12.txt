PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Our Company

Align Technology, Inc. was incorporated in April 1997
under the laws of the state of Delaware. We design, manufacture and market the
Invisalign system, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the
misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of
clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a
desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic
brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other
limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating
adults and teens with mature dentition. Align Technology received FDA clearance
to market Invisalign in 1998.

Under the Corporate
Information/Investor Relations section of our corporate website which can be
accessed at either

www.aligntech.com

or

www.invisalign.com

, we make our Annual
Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
current reports on Form 8-K, our proxy statement on Schedule 14A for
our annual stockholders’ meeting and amendments to such reports available as
soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or
furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. All such filings
are available free of charge. The information in, or that can be accessed
through, our website is not part of this report.

Industry Background

Malocclusion

Malocclusion, the
misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions,
affecting over 200 million individuals, or approximately 75% of the U.S.
population. Approximately two million people annually elect treatment by
orthodontists in the U.S. While most individuals seek


orthodontic
treatment to improve their appearance, malocclusion may also be responsible for
dental problems such as tooth decay, tooth loss, gum disease, jaw joint pain
and headaches. Because of the compromised aesthetics, discomfort and other
drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments, only a
relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek traditional
treatment.

Traditional
Orthodontic Treatment

In the U.S., dental professionals treat malocclusion
primarily with metal archwires and brackets, commonly referred to as braces. Occasionally,
dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic,
tooth-colored brackets or bond brackets on the inside, or lingual
surfaces, of the patient’s teeth. Dental professionals also augment braces with
elastics, metal bands, headgear and other ancillary devices.

The average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months
to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional
involvement, or chair time. To initiate treatment, a dental professional will
diagnose a patient’s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan. In a
subsequent visit, the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient’s
teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets. Thereafter, by
tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks, the
dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient’s teeth to
achieve desired tooth movement. Because of the length of time between visits,
the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to
achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval. In a final visit, the
dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient’s
teeth. Upon completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or
her discretion, have the patient use a retainer.

Fees for traditional
orthodontic treatment typically range between U.S. $3,500 to $7,000 with a
median fee of approximately $4,800; generally only a portion of the fees is
reimbursed by insurance, if covered at all. In addition, dental professionals
commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives. Fees are based
on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional’s
estimate of chair time, and are generally negotiated in advance. A treatment
that exceeds the dental professional’s estimate of chair time generally results
in decreased fees per hour of chair time, and reduced profitability for the
dental professional.

Limitations of
Traditional Orthodontic Treatment

Although braces are
generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions, they are
subject to many limitations and disadvantages. Conventional orthodontic
treatment is associated with:

·

Unattractive appearance

.   Braces call attention to the
patient’s condition and treatment. In addition, braces trap food, which can
further compromise appearance. Braces can also result in permanent
discoloration of teeth. Many adults associate braces with adolescence. As a
result of these and other limitations, less than one percent of American adults
with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment annually.

·

Oral discomfort

.   Braces are sharp and bulky and can
abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth. The tightening or
adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort,
especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit.

·

Poor oral hygiene

.   Braces compromise oral hygiene by
making it more difficult to brush and floss. These problems can result in tooth
decay and periodontal damage. Additionally, the bonding of brackets to teeth
can cause permanent markings on the teeth.

·

Inability to project treatment

.   Historically, dental
professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course
of treatment. Accordingly, dental professionals must rely on intuition and
judgment to plan and project treatment. As a result, they cannot be precise
about the


direction or distance of
expected tooth movement between patient visits. This lack of predictability may
result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professional’s
ability to estimate the duration of treatment. Because most orthodontic
treatment is performed on a fixed price basis, extended treatment duration
reduces profitability for the dental professional.

·

Physical demands on dental professional

.   The
manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and
visual acuity, and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional.

·

Root resorption

.   The sustained high levels of force
associated with conventional treatment can result in root resorption, which is
a shortening of tooth roots. This shortening can have substantial adverse
periodontal consequences for the patient.

·

Emergencies

.   At times, braces need to be repaired or
replaced on an emergency basis. Such emergencies cause significant
inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional.

Due to the poor
aesthetics, discomfort and other limitations of braces, relatively few people
with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment. Accordingly, we
believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses
these patient concerns. We also believe there is an unmet need among dental
professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and
efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability.

The Align Solution

Invisalign (which includes full Invisalign treatment
and Invisalign Express

discussed below under “Our Products”) is a
proprietary system for treating malocclusion. The Invisalign treatment process
is comprised of several phases, the principal steps of which are: the creation
of electronic treatment plans using ClinCheck and the manufacturing of
Invisalign aligners (referred to in this Form 10-K as “Aligners”). The
complete Invisalign treatment process is described in greater detail under “Business—The
Invisalign Treatment Process”.

ClinCheck.

ClinCheck
is an internally developed computer modeling program that allows dental
professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients. We use a
dental impression and a treatment form submitted by a dental professional to
develop a customized, three-dimensional treatment plan that simulates
appropriate tooth movement in a series of two-week increments. ClinCheck
allows the dental professional to view this three-dimensional simulation
with a high degree of magnification and from any angle. Accordingly, ClinCheck
enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of
accuracy not previously possible.

Upon review of the ClinCheck simulation, the dental
professional may immediately approve the projected treatment, or may provide us
with feedback for modification. We reflect any requested adjustments in a
modified simulation. Upon the dental professional’s approval of the ClinCheck
simulation, we use the data underlying the simulation, in conjunction with
stereolithography technology, to manufacture Aligner molds. International
Manufacturing Solutions Operaciones, S.R.L., or IMS, a third party shelter
services provider in Juarez, Mexico, manufactures the molds and then uses these
molds to fabricate the patient’s Aligners.

Aligners.

Aligners
are custom-manufactured, thin, clear plastic, removable dental appliances
that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two-week stage of the
ClinCheck simulation. Aligners are customized to perform the treatment
prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using ClinCheck. Each
Aligner covers a patient’s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn. Aligners
are commonly worn in pairs, over the upper and lower dental arches. Aligners
are generally worn for consecutive two-week periods which correspond to
the approved ClinCheck treatment simulation. After two weeks of use, the
patient replaces them with the next pair in the series. This process is
repeated until the final


Aligners are used
and treatment is complete. Upon completion of the treatment, the dental
professional may, at his or her discretion, have the patient use an Invisalign
retainer or go directly to a conventional retainer.

Our Products

The vast majority of our revenue is generated from the
sale of full Invisalign treatment and Invisalign Express treatment.

Full
Invisalign Treatment.

Commercial
sales of full Invisalign treatment commenced in the U.S. in July 1999. Our
traditional, full Invisalign treatment option is intended to be used as a
complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions. Each treatment plan is
unique to the individual patient and will consist of as many Aligners as
indicated by ClinCheck in order to achieve the doctor’s treatment goals. In
fiscal 2006, approximately 81% of our net revenue was generated by the sale of
full Invisalign treatment.

Invisalign
Express.

In the
third quarter of 2005, we launched Invisalign Express, a lower-cost solution
for less complex orthodontic cases. Invisalign Express is a dual arch
orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical
criteria and consist of up to ten Aligners. Invisalign Express is intended to
help a broader range of patients elect orthodontic treatment by providing a
lower-cost option for adult relapse cases, for minor crowding and spacing, and
as a pre-cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers. In
fiscal 2006, approximately 13% of our net revenue was generated by the sale of
Invisalign Express.

Ancillary and Other.

The remaining 6% of our net revenue is generated by
training fees and sales of ancillary products.

Benefits of
Invisalign

We believe that Invisalign
provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential
to establish Invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces.

Benefits to the
dental professional

·

Ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes

.   ClinCheck
enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely
outcome of treatment in an interactive three-dimensional computer model. ClinCheck
allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before
selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient.

·

Begin using Invisalign with minimal additional training

.   The
biomechanical principles that underlie treatment with the Invisalign system are
consistent with those of traditional orthodontics. Dental professionals can
complete our initial training within two days. We provide additional clinical
support following the initial training and encourage dental professionals to
attend continuing education classes, seminars and workshops.

·

Expanded patient base

.   We believe that Invisalign has
the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics. Currently, approximately
two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the U.S. These
patients represent approximately 1 percent of the population of people with
malocclusion. Of these, we estimate approximately 45 percent, or approximately
900,000 patients have mature dentition with mild to moderate malocclusion and
are therefore potential candidates for Invisalign. We believe that Invisalign
will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise
seek orthodontic treatment.


·

Decreased dental professional and staff time

.   Invisalign
eliminates the need for time-intensive processes such as bonding
appliances to the patient’s teeth, adjusting archwires during the course of
treatment and removing the appliances at the conclusion of treatment. As such,
use of Invisalign reduces dental professional and staff chair time and can
increase practice capacity.

·

Practice
productivity

.   We believe that as dental professionals move to
a higher volume of Invisalign patients, they will be able to better leverage
their existing resources, including office space and staff time, resulting in
an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity.

Benefits to the
Patient

·

Excellent aesthetics

.   Aligners are nearly invisible
when worn, significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with
conventional braces.

·

Comfort

.   By replacing the six-week adjustment
cycle of traditional braces with two-week stages, Aligners move teeth
more gently than conventional braces. Also, Aligners are thin, smooth and low
in profile. As a result, Aligners are more comfortable and less abrasive than
conventional braces.

·

Improved oral hygiene

.   Patients can remove Aligners
for tasks that are difficult with conventional braces, such as eating, brushing
and flossing. We believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay
and periodontal damage during treatment, which may result from conventional
braces.

·

Potentially reduced overall treatment time

.   Aligners
control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth.
In addition, the ClinCheck simulation from which Aligners are produced is
designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements. Together, these
factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to conventional braces.

·

Potentially reduced root resorption

.   We believe that
controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the
incidence of root resorption, which is the breakdown or destruction of root
structure.

·

Reduced incidence of emergencies

.   Typically, a lost or
broken Aligner is simply replaced with the next Aligner in the treatment
series, minimizing inconvenience to both patient and dental professional.

We believe that these
benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment
because of the limitations of conventional braces.

Limitations of
Invisalign

In some instances, the
Invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to conventional
treatment. Aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces, and we
charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used
in conventional treatment. Depending on the individual pricing policies of each
dental professional, the cost of full Invisalign treatment to the patient may
be greater than for conventional braces. Dental professionals must also
incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan. Once
a dental professional submits a case to us, there is generally a turn-around
time of a month or more before the corresponding Aligners are delivered. Aligners
may not be appropriate for all cases, such as severe malocclusion, which may
require Aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal
results. In addition, because Aligners are removable, treatment using
Invisalign depends on patients wearing their Aligners as recommended. Some
patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing Aligners
that may mildly affect speech. In some instances, patients have experienced
scratched or irritated gums, cheeks and lips and in some rare instances
allergic reactions have occurred. We believe that these limitations are
generally outweighed by the many benefits of Invisalign to both patients and
dental professionals.


Our Target Market
and Patient Base

We currently market Invisalign to treat patients with
mature dentition. Individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second
molars and substantially completed jaw growth, which typically occurs between
the ages of 11 and 15 years. We do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are
still developing, as the effectiveness of Invisalign relies on our ability to
accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment. Based on
our clinical studies to date, we recommend that dental professionals use
Invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a
component of treatment for severe malocclusions. We estimate 45 percent of the
people who annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the U.S., or more than
900,000 patients, have mature dentition and are therefore potential candidates
for Invisalign. Our market research indicates that the vast majority of people
with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment
because of its many limitations. We believe that, since Invisalign addresses
the primary limitations of braces, persons with malocclusion will be more
likely to seek treatment. We believe that adults, who are particularly
sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment, represent our
most immediate and significant market expansion opportunity.

In an effort to more fully penetrate our target
market, in August 2005, we launched Invisalign Express, a lower-cost
solution for less complex cases. Invisalign Express is a simple, dual arch
orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical
criteria and consist of up to ten Aligners. We expect Invisalign Express will
increase the overall market for Invisalign, as patients who would not have
otherwise sought orthodontic treatment due to its relatively high cost are
introduced to this lower-cost treatment option. We continue to market and sell
our traditional full Invisalign treatment option for more complex cases.

As of December 31, 2006, approximately 529,000
patients worldwide have started treatment using Invisalign. Internationally, we
operate in the geographic regions of Europe, Asia-Pacific, Japan and Latin
America. In 2006, international sales accounted for 16% of our net revenues. A
geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in Note 15 “Segments and
Geographic Information” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In each of fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total net
revenues.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to
establish Invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic
malocclusion through customer responsiveness, product leadership and
operational effectiveness. Key elements of our strategy include the following.

Customer
Responsiveness

Focus
on education and customer support.

In
order to build long-term relationships with our customers, we focus on
delivering superior training, support and services. Each year, we provide
numerous clinical education and training programs, which include certification
classes, conference calls, seminars and workshops. By participating in these
events, we believe that our customers will emerge with a better understanding
of the product and its applicability, and with a greater awareness for starting
and finishing Invisalign cases. We also maintain an online clinical education
center which is intended to augment our training workshops, conference calls
and seminars by enabling Invisalign-trained doctors to obtain continuing
education credits and access a full range of case studies and best practices.
As of December 31, 2006, we had trained approximately 40,800 dental
professionals worldwide on the use and benefits of Invisalign.


Educate
future orthodontists and general practitioners.

By educating dental students and orthodontic
residents on the benefits of the Invisalign technique, we believe they will be
more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer Invisalign
as a treatment option. Currently, we have incorporated the Invisalign technique
into the curriculum of 38 university programs. We expect additional dental
schools to integrate the Invisalign technique into their curricula in the
future.

Stimulate
demand for Invisalign treatment.

Our market
research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who
desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many
limitations, such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort. By
communicating the benefits of Invisalign to both dental professionals and
consumers, we intend to increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic
treatment annually. In 2007, we expect to increase the overall marketing
spending in the United States with a focus on programs designed to raise the
profile of Invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors.
We also intend to initiate similar consumer marketing efforts, but on a smaller
scale, in key European countries. We believe that this increased consumer awareness
of Invisalign will increase the market for our products.

Penetration into our
domestic market.

We have two customer channels:
the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist, or GP. As specialists,
orthodontists are a critical part of our business, and we expect that
orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue
to drive research for expanding Invisalign applications. However, there exists
a significantly greater number of GPs in North America than orthodontists. As
the primary care dental provider, GPs have access to a greater number of
patients than orthodontists, and possess a unique opportunity to educate these
patients and introduce them to Invisalign. GPs also have the ability to refer
appropriate cases to orthodontists and, in certain instances, may choose to
treat less complex cases themselves. We are committed to improving the
collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and GPs. We
continue to support study clubs, which pair experienced orthodontists
with less experienced GPs. These orthodontists act as mentors to the
GPs and lend them support and guidance in their Invisalign practice. Through
these study clubs, GPs are introduced to an experienced
Invisalign practitioner and are able to refer appropriate cases to these
orthodontists. In 2007, we expect that revenue generated by GPs will represent
an increasingly larger percentage of our revenue, largely due to the fact that
there are significantly more GPs than orthodontists. We believe that by
focusing on increasing utilization rates among our existing GP customers, the
overall market for Invisalign will increase, as patients that would not have
otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to Invisalign by their
GPs. Information regarding risks related to our expectation that orthodontists
and GPs will collaborate may be found in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”

Product Leadership

New
products and enhancements to products.

Our strategy
for ensuring product leadership focuses on delivering new products and product
features as well as enhancing the user experience. In 2005 we launched
Invisalign Express, a lower-cost solution for less complex cases, allowing the
dental professional to treat a broader range of patients. In the second half of
2006, we began a phased rollout of ClinAdvisor, a new suite of software tools
designed to make Invisalign case selection and submission processes more
efficient for doctors. During 2007, we expect to extend the product features
and functionality of ClinAdvisor to an increasing number of practices. In
addition, we plan to introduce a further series of software enhancements that
will evolve Invisalign into distinct suites of software tools for the orthodontist
and GP. Software enhancements for the orthodontist are intended to provide a
more robust set of tools for greater predictability, wider applicability and
more flexibility in the use of  the
Invisalign system. Software enhancements targeting the GP will focus on ease of
diagnosis, guidance through the case set-up process and self-help tools
designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion. We
continue to focus research and development efforts on next generation Aligner
material and a compliance indicator,


which efforts we expect to
extend at least through 2008. Next generation Aligner material is intended to
consistently deliver force to the teeth over a longer period of time. The
compliance indicator is intended to help the dental professional and the
patient understand if the patient has worn their Aligner for enough time to
effectively move their teeth. We believe continuing to introduce new products
and product features as well as enhancing the user experience will keep us at
the forefront of the market and increase demand for Invisalign.

Extend and defend
technology leadership.

Invisalign represents a
significant technological advancement in orthodontics. Our issued U.S. patents
broadly cover the Invisalign system, including digital modeling and
manipulation of scanned patient data, treatment planning, and fabrication of
dental appliances, among others. We continue to pursue further intellectual
property protection through U.S. and foreign patent applications and non-disclosure
agreements. We also seek to protect our software, documentation and other
written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. Nonetheless, our
intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or
may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of
various countries where the Invisalign system is distributed do not protect our
intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Information
regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology
and our intellectual property rights may be found in Part I, Item 1A
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”

See also Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings.”

Operational
Effectiveness

Expand and enhance manufacturing
capability

.   Our manufacturing operations are designed
to produce large numbers of custom Aligners at a high level of quality. To
improve cost efficiency, we conduct labor intensive processes in relatively low-wage
countries. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current
requirements and that additional or substitute space will be available as
needed to accommodate any expansion of operations. Our proprietary software
underlies our manufacturing process. By continually developing this software and
other manufacturing processes, we plan to increase the level of production
automation. Increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce
both unit costs and production times.

The Invisalign
Treatment Process

The Invisalign treatment process comprises the
following five stages:

Orthodontic
diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us.

In
an initial patient visit, the dental professional determines whether Invisalign
is an appropriate treatment. The dental professional then prepares a treatment
data package which consists of a polyvinyl-siloxane, or PVS, impression
of the relevant dental arches, x-rays of the patient’s dentition,
photographs of the patient, a bite impression depicting the relationship
between the patient’s upper and lower dental arches and an Invisalign treatment
planning form, or prescription. The impression is a critical component of
Invisalign as it depicts the three-dimensional geometry of the patient’s
teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models. An impression requires
the patient to bite into a viscous material. This material hardens, capturing
the shape of the patient’s teeth. The prescription is also a critical component
of Invisalign, describing the desired positions and movement of the patient’s
teeth. The dental professional sends the treatment data to our Santa Clara,
California facility.

Preparation
of three-dimensional computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion.

Upon
receipt, we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s
dentition. Using CT scanning, we scan the PVS impression to develop a digital,
three-dimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition. We
then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional’s
prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in
Costa Rica.


Preparation
of computer-simulated treatment and viewing of treatment using ClinCheck.

In
Costa Rica we transform this initial digital model into a customized, three-dimensional
treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two-week
increments. This simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed
clinical, treatment and quality standards. Upon passing review, the simulation
is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via Virtual
Invisalign Practice (VIP), our proprietary customer interfacing software, which
is available on our websites located at

www.invisalign.com

and

www.aligntech.com

. The dental
professional then reviews the ClinCheck simulation and determines whether to
ask us to make adjustments. By reviewing and amending the treatment simulation,
the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and, thus,
participates in the customized design of the Aligners. At this point, the
dental professional may also invite the patient to review ClinCheck, allowing
the patient to see the projected course of treatment. The dental professional
then approves the proposed treatment and, in doing so, engages us for the
manufacture of corresponding Aligners.

Construction of molds corresponding to each step of
treatment.

We use the approved ClinCheck simulation to
construct a series of molds of the patient’s teeth. Each mold is a replica of
the patient’s teeth at each two-week stage of the simulated course of
treatment. These molds are fabricated by IMS, a third party shelter services
provider based in Juarez, Mexico.

Manufacture of Aligners
and shipment to the dental professional.

From
these molds, IMS fabricates Aligners by pressure-forming polymeric sheets
over each mold. The Aligners are then trimmed, polished, cleaned and packaged. Following
final inspection, the Aligners are shipped directly to the prescribing dental
professional. We ship all of the Aligners in a single batch. In certain cases,
dental professionals may use Invisalign in conjunction with tooth-colored
attachments bonded to the patient’s teeth. These attachments are used to
increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the
Aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement. In
certain cases, we provide an aligner-like template to the dental
professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient’s
teeth. Also, in cases where interproximal reduction, or IPR, is requested by
the dental professional, we provide an IPR treatment form, quantifying the
amount of space to be created through enamel reduction, location, and timing of
IPR.

Manufacturing

To produce our highly customized, highly precise,
medical quality products in volume, we have developed a number of proprietary
processes and technologies. These technologies include complex software
solutions, computed tomography, known as CT scanning, stereolithography and
automated Aligner fabrication.

We rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of
the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process. In the event that
either of these vendors become unable for any reason to supply us with their
respective products, we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we
qualify and obtain an alternate source.

As of December 31,
2006, our manufacturing and operations staff in the U.S. and Costa Rica
consisted of 672 people. Manufacturing is coordinated in Santa Clara,
California. Digital dental modeling is processed in our 63,000 square foot
facility in San Jose, Costa Rica. The operations team in Costa Rica creates
ClinCheck treatments using simulation software. In anticipation of increased
capacity demands primarily resulting from the Patients First Program, we hired
approximately 100 new dental technicians in Costa Rica in the fourth quarter of
2006.

For a more complete discussion of the Patients
First Program, please see Part I, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Overview”.

In
the second quarter of 2006, in an effort to optimize operations, improve
efficiency and reduce operating costs, we relocated our streolithography (SLA)
mold fabrication operations from our Santa Clara, California facility to IMS, a
third party shelter services provider based in Juarez, Mexico. We


also use
IMS for the fabrication and packaging of Aligners. Information regarding risks
associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found
in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the
heading “Risk Factors.”

Throughput
Management

Because we manufacture each case on a build-to-order
basis, we must conservatively build manufacturing capacity for anticipated
demand. To increase throughput, we must improve the efficiency and increase the
scale of our manufacturing processes.

In order to increase the
efficiency of our manufacturing processes, we focus our efforts on software
development and the improvement of rate-limiting processes, or
bottlenecks. We continue to upgrade our proprietary, three-dimensional
treatment-planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment
data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case,
thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in Costa Rica. During the
first half of 2007, as a result of the increase in demand for Invisalign case
volume primarily due to of the Patients First Program (discussed in Part I,
Item 7 “Managements Discussion and Analysis—Overview”), we will monitor our
capacity in Costa Rica to ensure a sufficient number of technicians have been
hired. We are also continuing the development of automated systems for the
fabrication and packaging of Aligners manufactured in Juarez, Mexico. In order
to scale our manufacturing capacity, we expect that we will continue to invest
in capital equipment.

Quality Assurance

Align’s quality system is in compliance with Food &
Drug Administration’s Medical Device regulations, 21CFR Part 820, and
Health Canada’s Medical Device Regulations. We are certified to EN ISO
13485:2003, internationally recognized standards for Medical Device
manufacturing and of the Council of Canada. Align has a formal, documented
quality system by which quality objectives are defined, understood and
achieved. Systems, processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high
levels of product and service quality. We monitor the effectiveness of the
quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive
to continually improve our systems and processes, taking corrective action, as
needed.

Since we custom manufacture Aligners on a build-to-order
basis, we do not offer refunds on our products. Because each ClinCheck and each
Aligner is unique, we inspect 100% of the product at various points in the
manufacturing process, to ensure that the product meets our customers’
expectations. Aligners are subject to the Invisalign product warranty, which
covers defects in materials and workmanship. Our materials and workmanship
warranty is in force until the Invisalign case is completed. In the event the
Aligners fall within the scope of the Invisalign product warranty, we will
replace the Aligners at our expense. Our warranty is contingent upon proper use
of the Aligners for the purposes for which they are intended. If a patient
chooses not to wear the Aligners, and as a result, requests additional
Invisalign treatment, the dental professional pays the additional expense of
the replacement Aligners.

The Invisalign product
warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment
using Invisalign. Actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the
approved ClinCheck treatment plan. Deviations not covered under warranty have typically
been the result of unpredictable biological factors, such as variations in bone
density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth. Warranty treatment
requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient’s
dentition to us. We use the impressions to create a new ClinCheck treatment
plan for the dental professional to approve, from which a successive series of
Aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment.


Sales and Marketing

We market Invisalign by
communicating Invisalign’s benefits directly to dental professionals through
our training, certification programs and direct mail campaigns and to consumers
with a nationwide advertising campaign. Based on our experience with
advertising and commercial sales, we believe that making consumers aware of
Invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for
Invisalign. In order to serve anticipated demand, we are training a broad base
of dental professionals.

Professional
Marketing

Our sales and support staff has been engaged in
marketing Invisalign to orthodontists since July 1999. In 2001, we began
marketing Invisalign to general practitioner dentists in our domestic market. As
of December 31, 2006 our North America sales organization consisted of
130 people of which 109 were direct sales representatives and 21 were
sales administration and management. Internationally, we have approximately 40
people engaged in sales and sales support as December 31, 2006. We provide
training, certification, marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and
general practitioner dentists in the U.S. and Canada, which we consider our
domestic market, and internationally.

As of December 31, 2006, we had trained
approximately 40,800 dental professionals worldwide to use Invisalign. Of those
trained dental professionals, approximately 73% are dental professionals in our
domestic market (United States and Canada). Within our domestic market, we have
trained approximately 8,000 orthodontists and approximately 22,000 active
general practitioner dentists.

Invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles
that apply to traditional treatment. Our sales and orthodontic teams conduct
training primarily in a workshop format. The key topics covered in training
include Invisalign applicability, instructions on filling out the Invisalign
treatment form, clinical tips and techniques, guidance on pricing and
instructions on interacting with our ClinCheck software and the many other
features of our website.

After training, sales
representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their
staff is prepared to handle Invisalign cases. Such follow up may include
assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions, establishing an
Internet connection and familiarizing them with our website. Sales
representatives may also provide practice-building assistance, including
helping the dental professional to market Invisalign to prospective patients
through direct mail or other forms of media. Many dental professionals have
commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance.

Consumer Marketing

Our experience
indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources:

·

an
orthodontist;

·

a
general practice dentist;

·

consumer
marketing and advertising;

·

our
website, which can be accessed at either

www.invisalign.com

or

www.aligntech.com;

·

direct-to-consumer
mail advertising and public relations efforts; and

·

other
Invisalign patients.

In 2007, we expect to
increase the overall marketing spend in the United States with a focus on
programs designed to raise the profile of Invisalign and drive more consumers
to our most experienced doctors. We believe that this increased consumer
awareness of Invisalign will increase demand for our product.


Research and
Development

Our research and development effort is focused on
extending the range of dental applicability of Invisalign, enhancing the
software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our Invisalign system
product lines. Our research and development expenses were $18.5 million for
fiscal 2006, $18.6 million for fiscal 2005 and $15.8 million for fiscal
2004.

In an effort to
demonstrate Invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities, various clinical case
studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of
Invisalign to malocclusion cases, including those of severe complexity. We are
also undertaking post-marketing studies and making additional
technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process. We have
recently started a phased roll out of ClinAdvisor, a new suite of software
tools, designed to make Invisalign case selection and submission processes more
efficient and predictable for our doctors. In addition, we plan to introduce a
further series of software enhancements that will evolve Invisalign into
distinct suites of software tools for the orthodontist and GP. Software
enhancements for the orthodontist are intended to provide a more robust set of
tools for greater predictability, wider applicability and more flexibility in
the use of the Invisalign system. Software enhancements targeting the GP will
focus on ease of diagnosis, guidance through the case set-up process and
self-help tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate
malocclusion. We continue to focus research and development efforts on next
generation Aligner material and a compliance indicator, which efforts we expect
to extend at least through 2008.

Intellectual
Property

We believe our intellectual property position represents
a substantial business advantage. As of December 31, 2006, we had 85
issued U.S. patents, 120 pending U.S. patent applications, and numerous foreign
issued patents, as well as pending foreign patent applications.

See Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings for a discussion on
Reexamination Proceedings pending with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office.

We continue to pursue
further intellectual property protection through U.S. and foreign patent
applications and non-disclosure agreements. We also seek to protect our
software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and
copyright laws. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of
any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may
be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and
sufficient to protect our technology or products. Our intellectual property
rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated,
circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries
where Invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights
to the same extent as U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary
information could harm our business. Information regarding risks associated
with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual
property rights may be found in Part I, Item IA of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
under the heading “Risk Factors.”

Competition

We compete for the attention of dental professionals
with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances (or wires and
brackets), which include 3M Company, Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply
International, Inc. We also compete directly with established companies
that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to Invisalign,
including the product called Red, White & Blue manufactured and
distributed by Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron Dental Specialties. In May 2006,
Danaher Corporation purchased Sybron Dental Specialties.

See Part I,
Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for a summary of our litigation with Ormco.

In
May 2005, OrthoClear, Inc. announced the commercial launch of the
OrthoClear system, a product that was intended to compete directly with our
Invisalign system. On October 13, 2006, we entered into a formal agreement
with OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear Holdings, Inc., and OrthoClear
Pakistan Pvt. Ltd. (“OrthoClear”), together with certain


individuals associated
with OrthoClear to end all pending litigation between the parties. In addition,
OrthoClear agreed, among other things, to stop accepting new patient cases for
treatment, consent to the entry of an exclusion order by the ITC prohibiting
the importation of OrthoClear aligners into the United States, assign and
transfer to Align all intellectual property rights with application to the
correction of malocclusion and to discontinue all design, manufacture,
marketing and sales of removable dental aligners worldwide.

See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for a summary of our
litigation with OrthoClear.

In the future, we may face further
competition from other early stage and more mature companies who enter our
target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use
to Invisalign. Information regarding risks associated with increased
competition may be found in Part I, Item IA of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
under the heading “Risk Factors.”

We believe that in
addition to price, the principal competitive factors in the market for
orthodontic appliances include the following:

·

aesthetic
appeal of the treatment method;

·

effectiveness
of treatment;

·

customer
support;

·

comfort
associated with the treatment method;

·

oral
hygiene;

·

ease
of use; and

·

dental
professionals’ chair time.

We believe that Invisalign
compares favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these
factors.

Government
Regulation

FDA’s
Quality System Regulation for Medical Devices.

In 2006,
we were informed by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, that our
Invisalign system had been reclassified as a Class II medical device. The
Invisalign system was previously regulated as a Class I medical device and
was exempted from requiring 510(k) pre-market notification prior to
commercialization. In 1998, however, we had voluntarily filed with and
subsequently received pre-market clearance from the FDA pursuant to the 510(k) pre-market
notification procedure, allowing us to market the product in the U.S. Therefore,
we currently possess the necessary 510(k) clearance from the FDA to
continue to market our product under the Class II classification. Prior to
the reclassification, our product development, manufacturing processes,
packaging, labeling, handling, storage and distribution activities were subject
to extensive oversight by the FDA. We believe our Invisalign system is in
compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations,
record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of
the Invisalign system. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty or
material cost increases in complying with applicable performance standards as a
result of the incremental regulatory requirements resulting from the Class II
reclassification.

Our Aligners are manufactured by IMS, a third party shelter services
provider based in Juarez, Mexico. IMS is registered with the FDA as a medical
device manufacturer and is certified to ISO 9001:2000 requirements. We have
also ensured that our quality system procedures and processes have been
implemented at IMS to comply with the FDA’s Quality Systems standards. IMS has
dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel in the manufacture
and distribution of Invisalign. We and IMS are subject to routine inspections
by the FDA and state agencies to determine compliance with Quality System
requirements. We are registered with the State of California as a medical
device manufacturer.


If the FDA determines that we or IMS failed to comply with the applicable
FDA regulations, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against
us, ranging from a public Warning Letter to more severe sanctions, including
but not limited to financial penalties, withdrawal of our right to market our
products and criminal prosecution.

Health
Canada’s Medical Device Regulations.

In Canada, we
are required to comply with Health Canada’s

Medical Device
Regulations. Our products are registered with Health Canada. We believe we are
in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market
our products in Canada.

European
Union’s MDD Requirements & ISO 13485.

In
Europe, Invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such, we follow the
requirements of the Medical Device Directives. We are ISO 13485 certified,
which facilitates commercialization of Invisalign outside the United States and
especially in Europe.

Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

Under
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA,
Congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to
establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain
health information. Confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances
under which these records may be released are subject to substantial
regulations under the HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable
Health Information, referred to as the Privacy Standard, and other state laws
and regulations. The Privacy Standard governs both the disclosure and the use
of confidential patient medical information. Although compliance is principally
the responsibility of the hospital, physician or other healthcare provider, we
are required to maintain the confidentiality of patient information when
providing technical services and when handling patient information and records.
We have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the
requirements of the Privacy and Security standards under HIPAA and applicable
corresponding state laws and regulations. Maintaining systems that are
consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex
changes in the way we do business or provide services to our patients. Additionally,
our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in
dealing with HIPAA requirements.

Other Federal and State
Laws.

As a participant in the health care
industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under
many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and
local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be, applicable to our
business. Furthermore, our health care service provider customers are also
subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature
and scope of their relationships with us. Laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers
cover a broad array of subjects. For example, the confidentiality of patient
medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be
used by us, released for inclusion in our databases, or released by us to third
parties, are subject to substantial regulation by state governments. These
state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of
confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly. In addition,
provisions under the federal anti-kickback statute prohibit, among other
things, paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral
of patients to a person participating in, or for the order, purchase or
recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by,
Medicare, Medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs. Most
states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the
federal laws. These laws are applicable to our financial relationships with,
and any marketing or other promotional activities involving, our dental
professional customers. Finally, various states regulate the operation of an
advertising and referral service for dentists, and may require registration of
such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various
requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their
relationships with participating dentists. Violations of any of these laws or
regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions.


Employees

As of December 31,
2006, we had 1,253 employees, including 672 in manufacturing and operations,
309 in sales and marketing, 115 in research and development and 157 in general
and administrative functions. We had 487 employees in the U.S., 620 employees
in Costa Rica, 116 employees in Europe and 30 employees in other international
regions.

ITEM 1A. RISK
FACTORS

If we
fail to grow our revenue while controlling our expenses, the market price of
our common stock may decline.

You should consider
our business and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties
encountered by a company in an early stage of operations. Consistent with a
company in an early stage of operations, we continue to incur significant
operating expenses to:

·

develop
new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing processes;

·

execute
our consumer marketing campaign and dental professional marketing efforts;

·

increase
the capacity of our business enterprise systems and manufacturing operations;

·

execute
clinical research and education plans;

·

develop
technological improvements to our products and new product development;

·

continue
our international sales and marketing efforts;

·

protect
our intellectual property, including trade secrets; and

·

undertake
quality assurance and improvement initiatives.

For instance, in an effort to raise the profile of
Invisalign and match prospective patients with our most experienced dental
professionals, we have in the past utilized consumer marketing campaigns
involving television, radio and print media. Marketing programs of this nature
are expensive and may have limited success, if any, and may not result in
revenue generation commensurate with their costs.

In addition, in an attempt to help minimize treatment
disruptions for former OrthoClear patients and their doctors, we committed to
make Invisalign treatment available to existing OrthoClear patients at no
charge from Align through our “Patients First Program”. As a result, we will
receive no revenue for any additional cases we start under this program while
incurring significant expenses as well as increased demands on our sales and
customer service representatives and on our manufacturing processes. We
currently anticipate that we will be able to complete the Patients First
Program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Our success will
depend in part on our ability to effectively integrate the OrthoClear patients
into our infrastructure with minimal impact on our existing and new doctors. In
implementing this program, we experienced higher than anticipated demand from
the Patients First Program as well as regular new patients. As a result, many
of our customers experienced longer customer service hold times and slight
delays in ClinCheck processing times during the fourth quarter of 2006 which we
anticipate will continue during the first and second quarters of 2007. Although
we believe these delays are temporary in nature, these difficulties could cause
us to lose existing customers, face potential customer disputes or limit the
number of new customers who purchase our products or services. This could cause
a decline in our revenues, gross margins and net profits, and could adversely
affect our operating results.

See Part II, Item 7 “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview”

.

While we achieved profitability
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and through the second quarter
of fiscal 2005, we experienced a net loss in the third quarter of 2005 as well
as each quarter of 2006. If we are to achieve profitability in future periods,
we will need to continue to increase our revenues, while controlling our
expenses. While we generated positive operating cash flow for the first time in
fiscal year 2003 and continued to generate positive operating cash flow in
fiscal years 2004 and 2005, we experienced negative cash flow in 2006. We
cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow from
operations, from period to period, in the future. Because our business is
evolving, it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of
growth, and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to
sustain our historical growth rates. If we do not increase profitability or
revenue growth or


otherwise
meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of
our common stock will likely decline.

We
have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to
fluctuate which may cause volatility in our stock price.

We were
incorporated in April 1997 and began sales of Invisalign in July 1999.
Thus, we have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate
our future prospects. In addition, we expect our future quarterly and annual
operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing our commercial sales.
These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. Some of the factors
that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include:

·

changes
in the timing of receipt of case product orders during a given quarter;

·

changes
in product mix due to the introduction of Invisalign Express, a lower-cost
alternative for treating less complex cases;

·

unanticipated
delays in production caused by insufficient capacity;

·

any
disruptions in the manufacturing process, including as a result of unexpected
turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes or
as a result of natural or other disasters beyond our control;

·

the
development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new
competitors;

·

aggressive
price competition from competitors;

·

costs
and expenditures in connection with ongoing litigation;

·

inaccurate
forecasting of revenues, production and other operating costs; and

·

investments
in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to
Invisalign.

To respond to these and
other factors, we may need to make business decisions that could adversely
affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy,
business structure or operations. For instance, although we entered into a
definitive agreement in October 2006 with OrthoClear whereby, among other
things, OrthoClear agreed to discontinue all design, manufacture, marketing and
sales of removable dental aligners worldwide, we experienced increased pricing
pressure in 2005 and 2006 as a result of the commercial launch of OrthoClear’s
product. Partly in response to this increased competition, in the fourth
quarter of 2005, we changed our pricing structure and reduced our list price
for full Invisalign treatment to $1,495 and expanded our volume based discount
program to all doctors. These programs were in effect in 2006, and had an
adverse impact on our revenues, gross margins and net profit (loss). Most of
our expenses, such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations, are
relatively fixed in the short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in
part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if our
revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations, we may be unable
to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues.
Therefore, our operating results for a given period may be adversely affected.
Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons
of our operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our
results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.

We
depend on the sale of Invisalign for the vast majority of our revenues, and any
decline in sales of Invisalign or average selling prices would adversely affect
revenue, gross margin and net profits.

We expect that revenues
from the sale of Invisalign will continue to account for the vast majority of
our total revenues for the foreseeable future. Continued and widespread market
acceptance of Invisalign by orthodontists, GPs and consumers is critical to our
future success. If orthodontists and GPs experience a


reduction
in consumer demand for orthodontic services, if consumers prove unwilling to
adopt Invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate, if
orthodontists and GPs do not collaborate as we expect, if orthodontists or GPs
choose to use a competitive product rather than Invisalign or if the average
selling price of our product declines as it has in the past, our operating results
would be harmed. Factors that could cause Invisalign not to achieve market
acceptance at the rate at which we expect, as well as the risk related to
declining average selling prices are described more fully below.

Dental professionals may not adopt Invisalign in
sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate.

Our success depends upon
increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the Invisalign system by dental
professionals. Invisalign requires orthodontists, GPs and their staff to
undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways. In
addition, because Invisalign has only been in clinical testing since July 1997
and commercially available only since July 1999, orthodontists and GPs may
be reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available.
Also, increasing adoption and cumulative use by orthodontists and GPs will
depend on factors such as the capability, safety, efficacy, ease of use, price,
quality and reliability of our products, our ability to provide effective sales
support, training and service and the availability of competing products,
technologies and alternative treatments. In addition, unanticipated poor
clinical performance of Invisalign could result in significant adverse
publicity and, consequently, reduced acceptance by dental professionals. Also
increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market
share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their
Invisalign practice. If Invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the
orthodontic and GP communities, our operating results will be harmed.

Consumers may not adopt Invisalign in sufficient
numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate.

Our success depends upon
the acceptance of Invisalign by a substantially larger number of dental
professionals as well as potential consumers to whom we are now actively
marketing. Invisalign represents a significant change from traditional
orthodontic treatment, and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not
find it preferable to conventional treatment. In addition, consumers may not
comply with recommended treatment guidelines for Invisalign, which could
compromise the effectiveness of their treatment. We have generally received
positive feedback from both orthodontists, GPs and consumers regarding
Invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for
treatment of malocclusion, but a number of dental professionals believe that
Invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients.
Market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental
professionals, as well as other factors including effectiveness, safety,
reliability, improved treatment, aesthetics, greater comfort and hygiene
compared to conventional orthodontic products and price for Invisalign compared
to competing products. Furthermore, consumers may not respond to our direct
marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience.
Adoption by consumers may also be affected by general macroeconomic conditions
in North America and internationally, which fluctuate and could be affected by
unstable global economic, political or other conditions.

The orthodontists and GPs may choose not to
collaborate and referrals between orthodontists and GPs may not increase at the
rate that we anticipate or at all.

Our success depends in
part upon improving the collaboration and referral relationships between
orthodontists and GP dentists. As specialists, orthodontists are a critical
part of our business, and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat
the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding
Invisalign applications. We expect, however, that the percentage of revenues
generated by GPs will increase, largely due to the fact that there are
significantly more GPs than orthodontists. As the primary provider of dental
care, GPs have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists,
possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to


Invisalign,
have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and, in certain
instances, may chose to treat less complex cases themselves. If this
collaboration and increase in referrals does not occur or occurs more slowly
than we anticipate, our operating results could be harmed.

Declines in average selling prices of our products.

In response to challenges
in our business, including increased competition, in November 2005, we
reduced the list price of full Invisalign cases and in the third quarter of
2005 we introduced Invisalign Express, a lower-cost solution for less complex
cases. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, we expanded our volume based
discount program to all doctors. As a result of these programs, the blended
average selling price for our products declined in 2006 compared to 2005 and
may further decline in 2007 as a result of greater participation in our volume
discount program. Additionally in Europe, we introduced new pricing initiatives
in the first quarter of 2006 which resulted in a lower average selling price in
2006. If we are required to introduce any similar programs in the future, our
revenue, gross margin and net profits (losses) may be adversely affected.

We
are dependent on our international manufacturing operations, which exposes us
to foreign operational, political and other risks that may harm our business.

Currently, two of
our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the
U.S. At our facility in Costa Rica, technicians use a sophisticated, internally
developed computer-modeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans,
which are transmitted electronically back to the U.S. These electronic files
form the basis of ClinCheck and are used to manufacture Aligner molds. In the
first quarter of 2006, we completed the process of relocating our SLA mold
fabrication operations from our Santa Clara, California facility to our third
party shelter services provider, IMS, located in Juarez, Mexico. IMS also
fabricates the Aligners and ships the completed products to our customers. As a
result of this relocation, our reliance on our international manufacturing
operations will continue to increase. Our increasing reliance on international
operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business
or results of operation, including:

·

difficulties
in hiring and retaining employees generally, as well as difficulties in hiring
and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical
aspects of our operations, as well as staffing in numbers sufficient to
implement the Patients First Program;

·

difficulties
in managing international operations, including our relationship with IMS, our
third party shelter services provider;

·

import
and export license requirements and restrictions;

·

controlling
production volume and quality of the manufacturing process;

·

political,
social and economic instability;

·

acts
of terrorism and acts of war;

·

interruptions
and limitations in telecommunication services;

·

product
or material transportation delays or disruption;

·

burdens
of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws;

·

trade
restrictions and changes in tariffs;

·

fluctuations
in currency exchange rates; and

·

potential
adverse tax consequences.


If any of these risks
materialize in the future, we could experience production delays and lost or
delayed revenue.

A key
step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology
that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process. If
we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth, and fail to hire
sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand, the delivery time
of our product could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of
operations.

Training technicians to
use our sophisticated computer modeling program that produces the electronic
treatment forms that form the basis of ClinCheck takes approximately 90 to 120
days. As a result, if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth, we
may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to timely create
ClinCheck treatment forms within the timeframe our customers expect. Any delay
in ClinCheck processing time could delay the ultimate delivery of finished
Aligners to our customers. Such a delay could cause us to lose existing
customers or limit the number of new customers who purchase our products. This
could cause a decline in our revenue and net profits and could adversely affect
our results of operations.

Our
headquarters, ClinCheck setup and other manufacturing processes are all
principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other
natural disasters.

Our digital dental
modeling is processed in our facility located in San Jose, Costa Rica. The
operations team in Costa Rica creates ClinCheck treatment plans using
sophisticated computer software. In addition, our Aligner molds and finished
Aligners are fabricated by IMS, our third party shelter services provider
located in Juarez, Mexico. Both Costa Rica and Mexico are earthquake zones and
may be subject to other natural disasters. If there is a major earthquake or
any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is
located, our ability to create ClinCheck treatment plans or manufacture and
ship our Aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers
experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed Aligners. In
addition, our headquarters facility is located in the San Francisco Bay area. A
earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a
disruption in our operations. Any such business interruption could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We currently rely on third parties to provide key
inputs to our manufacturing process, and if our access to these inputs is
diminished, our business may be harmed.

We currently outsource key
portions of our manufacturing process. We rely on IMS, a third party shelter
services provider located in Juarez, Mexico, to fabricate Aligner molds as well
as finished Aligners and to ship the completed product to customers. If IMS
fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services, we may be unable to
deliver our products in a timely manner, and our business may be harmed. Any
difficulties encountered by IMS with respect to hiring and retaining qualified
personnel, and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards, controls,
procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a
timely manner. Finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive,
time-consuming or impossible.

We
experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect
aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new
technologies in the future.

Currently, our Invisalign
product competes directly against a product called Red, White and Blue, which
is manufactured and distributed by Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron
Dental Specialties. In May 2006, Danaher Corporation purchased Sybron
Dental Specialties. Prior to OrthoClear agreeing, pursuant to the terms of an
agreement entered into in October 2006, to discontinue all design,
manufacture, marketing and sales of removable dental aligners worldwide, our
Invisalign system competed


directly
with an aligner product manufactured by them. In addition, manufacturers of
traditional braces, such as 3M Company, Sybron Dental Specialties and
Dentsply International have substantially greater financial resources and
manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may, in the future,
attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours. Large consumer
product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market. Furthermore, we
may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new
technologies. We may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or
more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically
unattractive. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or
respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors,
our business could be harmed. Increased competition from OrthoClear and other
competitors  recently resulted in and may
in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions, reduced gross
margins, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could
have a material adverse effect on our revenue, volume growth, net profit and
stock price. For instance, in the fourth quarter of 2005, in order to encourage
continued use of our products, we extended our volume based discount program to
all of our doctors. In addition, in the second half of 2005, we introduced
Invisalign Express, a lower-cost solution for less complex cases as well as a
new pricing initiative which had the effect of reducing our average selling
price per case. These programs have adversely affected our revenues, gross
margin and net profit. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete
successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive
pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Our
information technology systems are critical to our business. System integration
and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our
operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and
operating results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation
of complex information technology systems. All information technology systems
are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources. As our
business has grown in size and complexity, the growth has placed, and will
continue to place, significant demands on our information technology systems.
To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continually upgrade and
enhance our information systems. In addition, experienced computer programmers
and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate
our confidential information or that of third parties, create system
disruptions or cause shutdowns. Furthermore, sophisticated hardware and
operating system software and applications that we either internally produce or
procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture,
including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the
operation of the system. The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems,
viruses and bugs could be significant, and the efforts to address these
problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact
on our operations, revenues and operating results.

In addition, our data center operations are located in
our headquarters in Santa Clara, California. We are in the process of moving
our data center operations and changing our data center infrastructure. We
expect the move to be completed over the next two years. We may experience
technical difficulties in connection with these changes. If we experience a
system failure or disruption for any reason, including in connection with
changes in our data center location or infrastructure, the performance of our
website would be harmed and our service could shut down.

Throughout 2006 we focused
on adding additional functionality into our business enterprise systems and
intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future, which will more
efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications, such as
customer facing and manufacturing tools. System upgrades and enhancements
require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources.
Delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of
these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition and operating results.


Furthermore,
we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications, specifically
ClinCheck and VIP. Software applications frequently contain errors or defects,
especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released.
The discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the failure of
our primary information systems may result in the following consequences, among
others: loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation
or increased service costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect
upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our
success depends in part on our proprietary technology, and if we are unable to
successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position
may be harmed. Litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our
management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to
maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further
intellectual property protection for our products, both in the U.S. and in
other countries. Our inability to do so could harm our competitive position. As
of December 31, 2006, we had 85 issued U.S. patents, 120 pending U.S.
patent applications, and numerous foreign issued patents, as well as pending
foreign patent applications.

We intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and
pending patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries to protect a
large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position. However,
our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance
of patents. Additionally, any patents issued to us may be challenged,
invalidated, held unenforceable, circumvented, or may not be sufficiently broad
to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to
our products. During fiscal 2005 and 2006, requests were filed with the United
States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) by a San Francisco, California law
firm, acting on behalf of an unnamed party and in some instances acting on
behalf of OrthoClear, requesting re-examination of a number of our patents.

See Part I Item 3 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for a summary of the USPTO proceedings.

In
addition, any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than
that provided under U.S. patents and intellectual property laws. We also rely
on protection of our copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary
information. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
employees, consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a
relationship with us. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful
protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or
other confidential information, and adequate remedies may not exist if
unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur.

See
Part I Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary
of the OrthoClear litigation.

Our inability to maintain the
proprietary nature of our technology through patents, copyrights or trade
secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth
prospects. In particular, a failure of our proprietary rights might allow
competitors to copy our technology, which could adversely affect our pricing
and market share.

In addition, in an effort to protect our intellectual
property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in
litigation. For example, in October 2006, we entered into an agreement
with OrthoClear whereby OrthoClear and Align agreed, among other things, to
dismiss all pending lawsuits against each other, including the patent
infringement action against OrthoClear filed in the Western District of
Wisconsin (Madison). In addition, we are currently involved in a patent
infringement lawsuit with Ormco. The potential effects on our business
operations resulting from similar litigation that we may participate in the
future, whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us, are
costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical
personnel from normal business operations. Any of these results from our
litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.


In addition, we are
currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims. Management
does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal proceedings and
claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results
of operations. In addition, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and
unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary
damages or, in cases where injunctive relief is sought, an injunction
prohibiting us from selling our products. Any of these results from our
litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.

See Part I Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings.

While we believe we currently have adequate internal
control over financial reporting, we are required to assess our internal
control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse
results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our
financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.

Pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC, we are required to furnish in our Form 10-K an Annual
Report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether
or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This
assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting identified by management. While we currently
believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, the
effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk
that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, and,
as a result, the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial
reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we are unable to
assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any
future period (or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the
effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls
are ineffective), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and
completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on
our stock price.

Our future success may depend on our ability to
develop and successfully introduce new products.

Our future success may
depend on our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval or clearance of,
manufacture and market new products. In the second half of 2005, we launched
Invisalign Express a lower-cost Aligner system used for less complex cases.

We recently announced a phased
rollout of ClinAdvisor, a new suite of software tools designed to make
Invisalign case selection and submission processes more efficient for doctors. In
addition, we plan to introduce a further series of software enhancements that
will evolve Invisalign into distinct suites of software tools for the
orthodontist and GP. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully develop, sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new
products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product. The
extent of, and rate at which, market acceptance and penetration are achieved by
future products is a function of many variables, which include, among other
things, price, safety, efficacy, reliability, marketing and sales efforts, the
availability of third-party reimbursement of procedures using our new products,
the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting
purchasing patterns. Our ability to market and sell new products may also be
subject to government regulation, including approval or clearance by the United
States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and foreign government agencies. Any
failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or
enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new
products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results and could cause our revenues to decline.


If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract
and retain key personnel, we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or
develop our products.

We are highly dependent on
the key employees in our clinical engineering, technology development, sales
and marketing personnel and management teams. The loss of the services of those
individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product
development and other business objectives and could harm our business. Our
future success will also depend on our ability to identify, recruit, train and
retain additional qualified personnel, including orthodontists. Few
orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since
they are generally trained to work in private practices, universities and other
research institutions. Thus, we may be unable to attract and retain personnel
with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our
business. Furthermore, we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel
or their services. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our
business could be materially harmed.

If we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of
other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim, our ability to
grow our business will be severely limited.

Extensive litigation over
patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device
industry. We have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the
past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future.
From time to time, we have received and may in the future receive letters from
third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. While we do not
believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been
brought to our attention, there may be other more pertinent rights of which we
are presently unaware. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property
suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative
proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion
of effort by our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination
of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could
subject us to significant liabilities. An adverse determination of this nature
could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly
or require us to seek licenses from third parties. Licenses may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in which event, our
business would be materially adversely affected.

We maintain single supply relationships for certain of
our key machines and materials technologies, and our business and operating
results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends.

We are highly dependent on
manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment, rapid prototyping machines,
resin and other advanced materials. We maintain single supply relationships for
many of these machines and materials technologies. In particular, we are
committed to purchase all of our resin from a single-source and our scanning
and stereolithography equipment are provided by single suppliers. Technology
changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity
or require expensive, time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate
new equipment or processes. Our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more
of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in
sufficient quantities to support our growth. In the event of technology
changes, delivery delays or shortages of these items, our business and growth
prospects may be harmed.

We have experienced
rapid growth, and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business.

We have expanded rapidly
since we commenced commercial sales in 1999. Our headcount increased from
approximately 50 employees as of December 31, 1999 to 1,253 employees as
of December 31, 2006. This expansion will continue to place significant
demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue
to develop and improve our operational, financial and other internal controls,
both in the U.S. and internationally. In particular, growth increases the
challenges involved in a number of areas, including recruiting and retaining
sufficiently skilled personnel, providing adequate training and


supervision
to maintain our high quality standards, and preserving our culture and values.
Our inability to effectively manage growth could harm our business.

We rely on our direct
sales force to sell our products, and any failure to maintain our direct sales
force could harm our business.

Our ability to sell our
products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our
domestic and international markets. As of December 31, 2006 our North
America sales organization consisted of 130 people of which 109 were
direct sales representatives and 21 were sales administration and management.
Internationally, we have approximately 40 people engaged in sales and sales
support as December 31, 2006. We do not have any long-term employment
contracts with the members of our direct sales force. The loss of the services
of these key personnel may harm our business. If we are unable retain our
direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent
technical expertise and qualifications, or if we are unable to successfully
instill such technical expertise or if we fail to reestablish strong
relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time, our
revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed.

Complying with regulations enforced by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and
time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial
penalties.

Our products are
medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and
internationally. FDA regulations are wide ranging and govern, among other
things:

·

product
design, development, manufacture and testing;

·

product
labeling;

·

product
storage;

·

pre-market
clearance or approval;

·

advertising
and promotion; and

·

product
sales and distribution.

Our failure to
comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement
action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following
sanctions:

·

warning
letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;

·

repair,
replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;

·

operating
restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;

·

refusing
our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products,
new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;

·

withdrawing
clearance or pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and

·

criminal
prosecution.

If any of these events were to occur, they could harm
our business. We must comply with facility registration and product listing
requirements of the FDA and adhere to applicable Quality System regulations.
The FDA enforces its Quality System regulations through periodic unannounced
inspections. We and IMS, our third party shelter services provider have not yet
been subject to an FDA inspection, and we cannot assure you we or IMS will successfully
pass such an inspection in the future. Our failure or the failure of  IMS to take satisfactory corrective action in
response to an adverse inspection or the failure to


comply with applicable
manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action, and we may be
required to find alternative manufacturers, which could be a long and costly
process.

Before we can sell a new
medical device in the U.S., or market a new use of or claim for an existing
product we must obtain FDA clearance or approval, unless an exemption applies.
Obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and
time-consuming process. Even though the devices we market have obtained the
necessary clearances from the FDA, we may be unable to maintain such clearances
in the future. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances
for new devices that we intend to market in the future. Our inability to
maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our
business.

If the security of our customer and patient
information is compromised, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable
for related damages, and our reputation could be impaired.

We retain confidential
customer and patient information in our processing centers. Therefore, it is
critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our
facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our
customers to be secure. Despite the implementation of security measures, our
infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses,
programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. If
we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare
information, we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be
impaired. In addition, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable if our
systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner. Our insurance
may not protect us from this risk.

If compliance with healthcare regulations becomes
costly and difficult for our customers or for us, we may not be able to grow
our business.

Participants in the healthcare industry are subject to
extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered
by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels, some of which
are, and others of which may be, applicable to our business. Furthermore, our
healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and
regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with
us.

The healthcare market
itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and
regulatory influences. Regulations implemented pursuant to the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), including regulations affecting the
security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare
providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and
unplanned enhancements of software applications or services, result in delays
or cancellations of orders, or result in the revocation of endorsement of our
products and services by healthcare participants. The effect of HIPAA and newly
enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict, and there can be
no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by
HIPAA and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any
resulting business opportunities.

Extensive and changing government regulation of the
healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk
of substantial government penalties.

In addition to
medical device laws and regulations, numerous state and federal
healthcare-related laws regulate our business, covering areas such as:

·

storage,
transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records;

·

prohibitions
against the offer, payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to
entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order,
purchase or recommendation of our products; and


·

the
marketing and advertising of our products.

Complying with these laws
and regulations could be expensive and time-consuming, and could increase our
operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing
activities or our revenues.

We face risks related to our international sales,
including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or
approvals.

We currently sell our
products in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan and
may expand into other countries from time to time. We do not know whether
orthodontists, GPs and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt
Invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate. In addition,
sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory
requirements that vary widely from country to country. The time required to
obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than
that required for FDA clearance or approval, and requirements for such
approvals may differ from FDA requirements. We may be unable to obtain
regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do
business or in which we may do business in the future. We may also incur
significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory
approvals. If we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our
products outside of the U.S., or if we fail to receive these approvals, we may
be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a
timely manner, if at all.

Our business exposes us to potential product liability
claims, and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product
liability claims or litigation.

Medical devices involve an
inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. We
may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or
incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found
unsuitable. Although we intend to continue to maintain product liability
insurance, adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms, if at
all, and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. A
product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could
result in significant legal defense costs. These costs would have the effect of
increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the
operation of our business, and could harm our business.

In fiscal 2006 and during the first two months of
fiscal 2007, the market price for our common stock was volatile.

The market price of
our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to
various factors, many of which are beyond our control. The factors include:

·

quarterly
variations in our results of operations and liquidity;

·

changes
in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our
revenues or operating results;

·

speculation
in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of
operations;

·

strategic
actions by our competitors, such as product announcements or acquisitions;

·

announcements
of technological innovations or new products by us, our customers or
competitors; and

·

general
market conditions.


In addition, the stock
market in general, and the market for technology and medical device companies
in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of
those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the
market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In
the past, class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing
company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s
securities. If a securities class action suit is filed against us in the
future, we would incur substantial legal fees, and our management’s attention
and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond
to the litigation.

Future sales of significant amounts of our common
stock may depress our stock price.

A large percentage of our
outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant
stockholders. These stockholders have sold in the past, and may sell in the
future, large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time.
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our
existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common
stock. Such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems
with our business and may depress our stock price.

Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and
regulations, could result in unfavorable accounting charges.

We prepare our
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles are
subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and
create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a
significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect
previously reported transactions. Our accounting policies that recently have
been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows:

·

revenue
recognition;

·

accounting
for share-based payments; and

·

accounting
for income taxes.

In particular, the FASB
recently enacted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS
123R”) which we adopted effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

See Note 10 “Shareholders’ Equity” of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information on the impact of FAS 123R on our
reported financial results.

We have made use of a shareholders rights’ plan to
limit the possibility that we are acquired, which may mean that a transaction
that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented.

Our board of directors has
the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to
determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such shares
without any further vote or action by our shareholders. To date, our board of
directors has designated 200,000 shares as Series A participating
preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan. The issuance
of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of
delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company or otherwise adversely
affecting the rights of the holders of our stock. The shareholder rights’ plan
may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition
of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors. The
shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting
to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors,
except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation, purchase or redemption
of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan.

PROPERTIES

Our headquarters are located in Santa Clara,
California. We lease approximately 127,000 square feet of space where we house
our customer support, operations, research and development and administrative
personnel. We lease our Santa Clara facilities under four leases, which expire
in June 2010. The combined monthly rent for the Santa Clara facilities is
approximately $75,000. Commencing July 1, 2005 and continuing on the first
day of each calendar month thereafter, $11,000 will be deducted from the $1.3
million security deposit previously paid by us to the lessor and such amount
will be applied against the monthly base rent for the Santa Clara facilities.

We operate a facility in San Jose, Costa Rica. The
facility comprises approximately 63,000 square feet of manufacturing and office
space. The monthly rent for the Costa Rica facility is approximately $59,000.
The lease for this facility expires at the end of 2008.

Our European headquarters are located in Amsterdam,
The Netherlands. The facility comprises approximately 11,000 square feet of
office space. The monthly rent for the Amsterdam facility is approximately
$33,000. The lease for this facility expires in 2014 with an option to
terminate with a fee of $238,000 during 2009. We expect this lease will not be
renewed beyond 2009.

We believe that our
existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that
additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any
expansion of operations.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.

OrthoClear

State
Action.

On
February 2, 2005, we filed a multi-claim lawsuit in San Francisco County
Superior Court against defendants OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear Holdings, Inc.,
Muhammad Ziaullah Chishti, Bao Tran, Peter Riepenhausen, Joe Breeland, Jeff
Tunnell, Christopher Kawaja, and Charles Wen (the “State Action”). Among other
things, the State Action alleged tort, contract, statutory and common law
causes of action arising from OrthoClear and the individual defendants’ alleged
plan to unlawfully utilize our intellectual property, confidential information
and employees. The State Action also alleged that OrthoClear, Chishti and other
defendants were in breach of contractual obligations, statutory law and common
law for attempting to intentionally interfere and disrupt our ongoing business
operations and improperly gain access to its customer relationships and trade
secrets. Subsequent to the initial filing date, there were extensive
proceedings in the case as reported in previous Align filings.

Federal
Lanham Action.

On July 19, 2005 and June 19,
2006, we filed a multi-claim lawsuit in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California against OrthoClear (the “Federal Lanham
Action I” and “Federal Lanham Action II”, respectively). The Federal Lanham
Action I and Federal Lanham Action II alleged numerous violations of the
Federal Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. §1051 et seq.) by OrthoClear and its officers and
employees. These violations include unfair competition, trademark infringement
and false advertising, among other things. The Federal Lanham Action I and
Federal Lanham Action II also alleged violations by OrthoClear of California’s
Unfair Practices Act (California Business and Professions Code §17200 et seq.).

Patent
Infringement ITC Complaint.

On January 11,
2006, we filed a formal complaint with the United States International Trade
Commission (ITC) against OrthoClear, seeking to halt the importation into the
United States of infringing aligners manufactured by OrthoClear in Pakistan in
violation of our


patents and other
intellectual property rights (the “ITC Complaint”). The ITC instituted a formal
investigation on February 7, 2006.

Patent Infringement
Federal Action.

On January 11, 2006, we
filed a federal court patent infringement action against OrthoClear in the
Western District of Wisconsin (Madison) (the “Patent Infringement Federal
Action”) asserting infringement of our U.S. Patents Nos. 6,685,469; 6,450,807;
6,394,801; 6,398,548; 6,722,880; 6,629,840; 6,669,037; 6,318,994; 6,729,876;
6,602,070; 6,471,511 and 6,227,850.

OrthoClear
Agreement

On October 13,
2006, Align and OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear Holdings, Inc., and
OrthoClear Pakistan Pvt. Ltd. (“OrthoClear”), together with certain individuals
associated with OrthoClear, executed a formal 
agreement (the “OrthoClear Agreement”) that included the following
terms:

·

OrthoClear was required to
immediately discontinue all design, manufacture, marketing and sales of
removable dental aligners worldwide;

·

OrthoClear consented to the
entry of an exclusion order by the ITC, enforced by the United States Customs
Service, which prevents OrthoClear from importing its dental aligner products
into the U.S., either directly or through a third party and the ITC
subsequently terminated its formal investigation on October 27, 2006;

·

The parties agreed to
dismiss all pending lawsuits against each other, including the State Action,
Federal Lanham Action I, Federal Lanham Action II, and Patent Infringement
Federal Action, with prejudice, and each such action has been subsequently
dismissed;

·

OrthoClear agreed to stop
accepting new patient cases for treatment;

·

OrthoClear and Muhammad
Ziaullah Chishti its CEO, and Charles Wen, its President,  transferred and assigned to Align all
intellectual property rights with application to the treatment of malocclusion;

·

OrthoClear principals
Muhammad Ziaullah Chishti, Charles Wen, Peter Riepenhausen, and Christopher
Kawaja signed 5-year, global non-compete agreements in the field of
removable aligner therapy products and related software market;

·

OrthoClear employees Joe
Breeland and Jeff Tunnell signed 5-year U.S. non-compete agreements and
prohibiting their personal participation in the removable aligner therapy
product and related software market;

·

We made Invisalign
treatment available to OrthoClear patients in the United States, Canada and
Hong Kong at no charge from Align. We implemented this program as the Patients
First Program.

See Part II, Item 7 “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview”
for discussion of the Patients First Program

.

In accordance with the
terms of the OrthoClear Agreement, on October 16, 2006, we made a one-time
cash payment of $20.0 million to OrthoClear Holdings, Inc.

Ormco

On January 6, 2003, Ormco Corporation  (“Ormco”) filed suit against us in the United
States District Court for the Central District, Orange County Division,
asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432, 5,683,243 and 6,244,861.
Ormco is a division of Sybron Dental Specialties. In May 2006, Danaher
Corporation acquired Sybron Dental Specialties. The complaint sought
unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. On February 18, 2003,
we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by
the Court of invalidity and non-infringement of the asserted


patents. In addition, we
counterclaimed for infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548, seeking
unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. Ormco filed a reply to our
counterclaims on March 10, 2003 and asserted counterclaims against us
seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity and non-infringement of U.S.
Patent No. 6,398,548. We amended our counterclaim to add Allesee
Orthodontic Appliances, Inc. (“AOA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ormco,
as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of U.S.
Patent No. 6,398,548. The Court then permitted Ormco to amend its
Complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim to add an additional
patent each. Ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of U.S.
Patent No. 6,616,444 on October 15, 2003. On October 27, 2003,
we filed an answer to Ormco’s first amended complaint and a counterclaim for
invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,616,444 and for
infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,554,611.

In connection with these claims, the Court granted
five motions for summary judgment that we filed. First, on May 14, 2004,
the Court granted our motion for summary judgment of non-infringement, finding
that our Invisalign system does not infringe any of the asserted Ormco patents
(5,477,432, 5,683,243, 6,244,861 and 6,616,644). Second, on July 2, 2004,
the Court granted in part our motion for summary judgment of infringement,
finding that Ormco and AOA infringe certain, but not all, claims of our patents
Nos. 6,398,548 and 6,554,611 through the manufacture and sale of Red, White &
Blue appliances. Third, on August 26, 2004, the Court granted our motion
for summary judgment of invalidity of Ormco’s asserted patents claims
(5,477,432, 5,683,243, 6,244,861 and 6,616,644). As noted above, the Court
earlier found that we do not infringe these patents. In addition, the Court
also denied Ormco’s and AOA’s motion for summary judgment seeking a finding of
invalidity of our asserted patent claims (6,398,548 and 6,554,611). Fourth, the
Court granted our summary judgment motion that our asserted patent claims are
not invalid based on the evidence currently before the Court. Although the
Court granted that motion, it reopened discovery on two additional invalidity
arguments Ormco and AOA asserted. Fifth, the Court also granted our summary
judgment motion that our patents are not unenforceable and granted Ormco’s and
AOA’s summary judgment motion that Ormco and AOA did not willfully infringe our
patents.

On December 20, 2004, we filed a further summary
judgment motion that our asserted claims are not invalid based on Ormco’s and
AOA’s new evidence. Ormco and AOA filed a counter-summary judgment motion that
our asserted claims are invalid based on this new evidence. The motions were
heard by the Court on February 7, 2005. On February 24, 2005, the
Court granted our motion in part, confirming the validity of all of the
asserted claims of our 6,554,611 patent and two of the asserted claims of our
6,398,548 patent. The Court also granted Ormco’s and AOA’s motion in part,
finding certain claims of our 6,398,548 patent to be invalid in view of prior
use evidence. On March 10, 2005, Ormco and AOA moved for reconsideration
of the Court’s ruling that Claims 10 and 17 of our U.S. Patent No. 6,398,548
are not invalid. On April 8, 2005, the Court ruled that it would adhere to
its previous ruling that Claims 10 and 17 of our 6,398,548 patent are not
invalid.

On March 28, 2005, we filed a motion for
permanent injunction to prevent Ormco and AOA from selling the infringing Red,
White & Blue system. On May 26, 2005, the Court issued a
permanent injunction (the “Permanent Injunction”) to enjoin Ormco and AOA from
further infringement of Claims 10 and 17 of our 6,398,548 patent and Claims 1-3
and 7 of our 6,554,611 patent. On May 31, 2005, Ormco and AOA noticed an
appeal to the Federal Circuit from the Permanent Injunction.

On February 1, 2006, we entered into a settlement
agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Ormco and AOA. In accordance with
the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Ormco and AOA  paid into escrow, pending the completion of
the appellate process, $884,000 to resolve the issues of past damages,
willfulness and attorneys’ fees for the adjudged infringement of Align’s U.S.
Patent Nos. 6,398,548 and 6,554,611 (the “Align Patents”) through the
manufacture and sale of Ormco’s and AOA’s Red, White & Blue appliances.
Our receipt of the payments out of escrow is contingent upon the Court, in a
final, non-appealable judgment, finding that Ormco or AOA infringes at least
one of the claims in the Align Patents. If, however, the Court issues a final,
non-appealable judgment of non-infringement, invalidity or


unenforceability with
respect to each asserted claim of the Align Patents, all funds in the escrow
account will be returned to Ormco and AOA. The Settlement Agreement does not
affect (a) Ormco’s appeal of the decisions and orders of the District
Court relating to Ormco’s patents; or (2) our pending cross-appeal of the
orders of the District Court relating to our patents.

There have been two appeals. After the Permanent
Injunction was entered, Ormco and AOA appealed that injunction and the orders
of the District Court on summary judgment on which that order was based. Oral
argument took place on April 3, 2006.  Following oral argument, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) issued a ruling declaring two out of a
total of seventy-one claims in our US Patent No. 6,398,548 and four out of
a total of ten claims in US Patent No. 6,544,611 to be invalid as “obvious.”
The CAFC’s decision reverses the California District Court summary judgment
order of validity.

The 6,398,548 patent consists of seventy-one claims;
only claims 10 and 17 were at issue in the appeal and CAFC ruling. These two
claims are directed to a system of appliances and method of repositioning teeth
from an initial to a final tooth arrangement where at least some of the
appliances are marked to show order of use. These claims contain further
limitations requiring instructions as to order in which the appliances are to
be worn and use of the appliances in intervals of 2-20 days.

The 6,544,611 patent consists of ten claims directed
to a system for repositioning teeth that includes one or more intermediate
appliances and a final appliance, provided in a single package, as well as
instructions which set forth the order in which the appliances are to be worn.
The CAFC’s ruling pertains only to claims 1, 2, 3 and 7 in the patent.

The majority of the claims in the 6,398,548 patent,
including claims that address methods of fabricating aligners, digital data
sets or computer-generated models to fabricate appliances, are unaffected by
the appeal and the CAFC’s ruling. The 6,544,611 patent does not contain claims
related to digital data, computer-generated models, or methods of fabrication.

The second appeal is from
the final judgment. Once final judgment was entered, Ormco filed a Notice of
Appeal from the final judgment and we filed a notice of cross-appeal. Ormco has
appealed the ruling of the District Court that its patents are not infringed by
us and that the asserted claims are invalid. We appealed the ruling of the
District Court that certain claims of our 6,398,548 patent which were found to
be infringed by Ormco’s and AOA’s Red, White & Blue appliances were
invalid. Briefing on this appeal and cross-appeal is complete, and oral
argument occurred on February 6, 2007.

  patent). We responded to this initial office action. A Final Office Action
  was issued by the USPTO on June 23, 2006 rejecting the pending claims of
  Align’s response. On August 23, 2006, we filed an amendment in response
  to this Final Office Action, which included claims discussed in an interview
  with the Examiners. We are awaiting further action by the USPTO.

On July 27, 2006,
  after submitting amendments, affidavits, declarations or other documents as
  evidence of patentability, we received an action entitled “Notice of Intent
  to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate” with respect to U.S. Patent
  No. 6,309,215 (the ‘215 patent). With this Notice, the USPTO has closed
  prosecution on the merits in reexamination and affirmed the patentability of
  all of our claims pending in reexamination in the ‘215 patent. While the ‘215
  patent entered the reexamination proceedings with 16 claims, 26 additional
  claims were added in the reexamination by us and the ‘215 patent leaves the
  proceedings as a valid and enforceable patent with 42 claims.

6,705,863

On July 25, 2006,
  we received an Office Action in U.S. Patent No. 6,217,325 (the ‘325
  patent) confirming the patentability of 32 claims. While the ‘325 patent
  entered the reexamination proceedings with 26 claims, 15 additional claims
  were added by us in the reexamination. On September 25, 2006, we filed
  an amendment in response to the final Office Action with respect to the
  claims that were not allowed. We are awaiting further action by the USPTO.


6,722,880

On December 23,
  2005, in a non-appealable, final Order, the USPTO denied the request for
  re-examination with respect to all twenty-one claims of U.S. Patent
  No. 6,722,880 (the ‘880 patent). Accordingly, the validity of all
  twenty-one claims of the ‘880 patent stand reaffirmed by the USPTO. On
  January 23, 2006, a Petition Seeking Review of Denial of Request for
  Re-examination of the ‘880 patent was filed by the same San Francisco,
  California law firm.

6,318,994

Yes

  U.S. Patent No. 6,629,840 (the ‘840 patent) without amendment and
  preliminarily rejected the remaining claims of the patents. The non-final
  initial Office Action presented us with the first opportunity to respond to
  the USPTO’s review and interpretation of the prior art. On September 13,
  2006, we submitted a response to the initial Office Action. We are awaiting
  further action by the USPTO.

6,685,469

No

N/A

The USPTO has granted
  the requests for reexamination of  U.S.
  Patent of U.S. Patent No. 6,685,469. We are awaiting an initial Office
  Action.

The re-examination
proceedings on Patent Nos. 6,318,994, 6,398,548, 6,685,469 and 6,705,863
(collectively, the “Remaining Patents”) are currently pending but we have not
received an Office Action. We, however, filed Preliminary Amendments adding
additional claims regarding two of the Remaining Patents. While the pending
re-examinations are in a preliminary stage, we believe that claims of the
patents in re-examination will be determined to be patentable as currently
written or as may be amended during the re-examination
proceeding. However, there can be no assurance that we will prevail, and
re-examination proceedings could result in some or all of the Remaining Patent
claims (as well as the ‘893, ‘215, ‘325 and ‘840 patent claims) having a
narrower scope of coverage or even to being invalidated, which could have an
adverse effect on us.

Bay Materials

On July 25, 2005, Bay Materials, LLC (“Bay”)
filed suit against us in the Superior Court of the State of California for the
County of San Mateo. The complaint, as amended, asserts, among other things,
breach of contract, promissory estoppel and fraud. Bay alleges that we breached
the terms of a purchase


order by failing to pay
for unshipped goods manufactured by Bay pursuant to such order. Bay further
alleges that we promised to purchase from Bay an alternative polyurethane
product, and Bay relied on this representation to develop such an alternative
product which we determined not to use. The complaint seeks monetary damages
exceeding $1.1 million related to breach of contract and research and
development costs incurred plus unspecified damages related to lost profit,
punitive and exemplary damages, and legal costs.

On March 27, 2006, we filed our answer to Bay’s
amended complaint, and also filed our cross-complaint against Bay for breach of
contract, breach of implied warranty of fitness, intentional misrepresentation,
concealment, specific performance, unjust enrichment and unfair business
practices. The cross-complaint seeks monetary damages against Bay exceeding
$1.0 million. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the parties agreed to settle their
dispute and dismiss all claims and cross-claims against each other in exchange
for a one time payment by us to Bay in the amount of $750,000.

Litigating claims of the
types discussed in Note 5 “Legal Proceedings” of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and in Part II, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, whether or not ultimately determined in
our favor or settled by us, is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of
our management and technical personnel from normal business operations. Any of
these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations
and stock price. From time to time, we have received, and may again receive,
letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. While
we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to
our attention, there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we
are presently unaware.

On March 6, 2007, the closing price of our common
stock on the NASDAQ Global Market was $16.40 per share. As of March 6,
2007 there were approximately 228 holders of record of our common stock.
Because the majority of our shares of outstanding common stock is held by
brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to
estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

We have never declared or
paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any
future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our credit
facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including restriction on
our ability to pay dividends.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be
read together with “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” and our consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

Overview

Align Technology, founded in April 1997, designs,
manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating
malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion
using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently
move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of
metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the
aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is
appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition. We received
FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998, and we began commercial operations
and sales of full Invisalign treatment in July 1999.

Each Invisalign treatment plan is unique to the
individual patient. Our full Invisalign treatment consists of as many Aligners
as indicated by ClinCheck in order to achieve the doctors’ treatment goals. In
the third quarter of 2005, we launched Invisalign Express, a low-cost solution
for less complex orthodontic cases. Invisalign Express is a dual arch
orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical
criteria and consist of up to ten Aligners. Invisalign Express is intended to
assist dental professionals to treat a broader range of patients by providing a
lower cost option for adult relapse cases, 
minor crowding and spacing or as a pre-cursor to restorative or cosmetic
treatment such as veneers.

We generate the vast majority of our revenues from the
sales of the Invisalign system (which includes full Invisalign treatment and
Invisalign Express) to orthodontists and GPs in the United States and Canada,
our domestic market. Sales of the Invisalign system in our domestic GP channel
and our domestic orthodontic channel represented approximately 45% and 33% of
our total net revenues during fiscal 2006, respectively. Our domestic full
Invisalign and Invisalign Express revenues represented 66% and 13% of our total
net revenue during 2006, respectively. Our international revenues represented
16% of our total net revenue during fiscal 2006.

A number of factors, the most important of which are
set forth below, may affect our results during the remainder of 2007 and
beyond.

·

Settlement with OrthoClear.

In the fourth quarter of
2006, we entered into a formal agreement with OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear
Holdings, Inc., and OrthoClear Pakistan Pvt. Ltd. (“OrthoClear”), together
with certain individuals associated with OrthoClear (the “OrthoClear Agreement”)
to end all pending litigation between the parties. In addition, OrthoClear
agreed, among other things, to stop accepting new patient cases for treatment,
consent to the entry of an exclusion order by the ITC prohibiting the
importation of OrthoClear aligners into the United States, assign and transfer
to Align all intellectual property rights with application to the correction of
malocclusion and to discontinue all design, manufacture, marketing and sales of
removable dental aligners worldwide. Certain OrthoClear principles also signed
five year non-compete agreements. In accordance with the terms of the
OrthoClear Agreement, we made a one-time cash payment of $20.0 million to
OrthoClear Holdings, Inc.

See Part I, Item 3 “Legal
Proceedings” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete
summary of the OrthoClear Agreement.

During the fourth quarter of
2006, we engaged a third-party firm to assist us  in assessing the value of the assets received
in conjunction with the OrthoClear Agreement. Based on this valuation, $14.0
million of the $20.0 million we paid to OrthoClear represented the fair value
of the non-compete agreements. These intangible assets were capitalized on our
balance sheet and are being amortized over 5 years beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2006. The intellectual property transferred to us was determined not
to have any


alternative future use and
therefore had no fair value. We recorded the remaining $6.0 million as settlement
costs. Through the OrthoClear Agreement we achieved our primary objectives in
the litigation as well as eliminated the costs and risks of protracted
litigation. As a result of the OrthoClear Agreement, we expect our legal
expenses will be reduced significantly in fiscal 2007 and our management and
technical personnel will be able to refocus their energy and resources on our
customers and product development.

·

“Patients First Program”.

As part of the OrthoClear
Agreement, OrthoClear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the
United States and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide. As a
result, most OrthoClear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment
with OrthoClear. In an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for these
patients and their doctors, we committed to make Invisalign treatment available
to OrthoClear patients at no additional charge from Align. Therefore, we will
receive no revenue for any additional cases we start under this program while
incurring significant expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded an
expense of $8.3 million for the anticipated cost of completing this program.
This amount is based on the number of OrthoClear cases registered under the
Patients First Program as of December 31, 2006 and the estimated costs
that will be incurred in order to fulfill our obligations as a result of this
program. If the actual number of OrthoClear cases under the program changes or
the actual costs differ significantly from our estimates, we would be required
to adjust the accrual for the Patient’s First Program, which could materially
impact our financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, $6.8 million
remained in accrued liabilities for this program.

Additionally,
this program has generated increased demands on our sales and customer service
representatives and on our manufacturing processes, including increased
headcount. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we hired approximately 100 additional
dental technicians at our facility in Costa Rica. Training these technicians to
use the sophisticated computer modeling program necessary to create ClinCheck
treatment forms, takes approximately 90 to 120 days. Therefore, although we
hired these additional technicians in the fourth quarter of 2006, these
individuals were not able to provide meaningful contribution to our
manufacturing process until the beginning of 2007. As a result of this
manufacturing constraint, although we initially sought to implement the
Patients First Program without impacting our existing customers, or new, paid
Invisalign cases, the influx of Patients First Program cases, as well as a
higher than expected number of paid Invisalign case submissions in the fourth
quarter, caused a delay in ClinCheck preparation time for some new cases by
approximately 10 days. Difficulties such as these in managing the deployment of
this program, could cause us to lose existing customers, face potential
customer disputes or limit the number of new customers who purchase our
products or services as well as result in lost or delayed revenue which could
cause a decline in our revenues, gross margins and net profits and adversely
affect our operating results. We currently anticipate that we will be able to
complete the Patients First Program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal
2007. We expect that as we complete the Patients First Program cases, the
incremental capacity and workforce created as a result of this program will be
utilized by the anticipated increase in paid Invisalign cases.

·

Penetration into our Domestic Market.

As specialists,
orthodontists are a critical part of our business, and we expect that
orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue
to drive research for expanding Invisalign applications. However, there exists
a significantly greater number of GPs in North America than orthodontists. As
the primary provider of dental care, GPs have access to a greater number of
patients than orthodontists, and possess a unique opportunity to educate these
patients on the benefits of oral care and introduce them to Invisalign. GPs
also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and may
choose to treat less complex cases themselves. Largely due to the fact that
there are significantly more GPs than orthodontists, we expect that an
increasingly larger percentage of our revenues will be


generated by GPs. In fact,
in fiscal 2006, our domestic GP channel generated 45% of our total net revenue,
while the orthodontic channel represented 33%. We continue to believe that by
focusing on increasing utilization rates among our existing GP customers, the
overall market for Invisalign will increase, as patients who would not have
otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to Invisalign by their
GPs. In 2007, we expect to increase the overall marketing spend in the United
States with a focus on programs designed to raise the profile of Invisalign and
drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors. We anticipate that this
increased consumer awareness of Invisalign will increase the market for our
product. In addition, by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on
the benefits of the Invisalign technique, we believe they will be more likely
to use this technology in their future practices and offer Invisalign as a treatment
option. As of December 31, 2006, we have integrated the Invisalign
technique into the curriculums of 38 university programs, including Harvard
University, Columbia University, Temple University and the University of Texas
at San Antonio. We expect additional dental schools to integrate the Invisalign
technique into their curriculums in the future.

·

Product Mix.

In the third quarter of 2005, we launched
Invisalign Express, a low-cost solution for less complex orthodontic cases. In
the fourth quarter of 2006, we experienced a decline in the number of
Invisalign Express cases as compared to the third quarter of 2006. Although we
expect that the number of Invisalign Express cases in the first quarter of 2007
will be relatively consistent compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, we expect
to see an increasing number of Invisalign Express cases during the remaining
quarters of 2007.

·

Continued Product Leadership

.   We are
committed to investing in delivering new products, enhancing the user
experience and introducing new product features to our existing products. In addition to Invisalign Express,
launched in 2005, in the second half of 2006 we announced a phased rollout of
ClinAdvisor, a new suite of software tools designed to make Invisalign case
selection and submission processes more efficient for doctors. During 2007, we expect to extend the
product features and functionality of ClinAdvisor and release it to an increasing
number of practices. In addition, we plan to introduce further software
enhancements directed at our more experienced doctors that will provide these
doctors with a robust set of tools for greater predictability, wider
applicability and more control. We are also continuing to focus our
research and development efforts on a next generation Aligner material as well
as a compliance indicator which will help doctors and patients understand if
the patients have worn their Aligners for enough time to effectively move their
teeth. We expect these efforts to extend at least through 2008. By investing in
developing these new products and continually enhancing our existing products,
we expect to increase market share.

·

Expansion of International Markets.

We
will focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of Invisalign by dental
professionals in key international markets, including Europe and Japan. We will
consider expanding into additional countries on a case by case basis. In 2006,
our international channel represented approximately 16% of our total net
revenue primarily as a result of growth in Europe. In 2007, we expect to
increase our consumer marketing efforts in key European markets. We expect our
international revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars, and we
expect international revenue as a percentage of total net revenue will be
comparable in the foreseeable future.

·

Increasing Reliance on International Manufacturing Operations.

Our
manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future
profitability. Currently, two of our key production steps are performed in
operations located outside of the U.S. At our facility in Costa Rica, dental
technicians use a sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program
to prepare electronic treatment plans, which are transmitted electronically
back to the U.S. These electronic files form the basis of ClinCheck and are
used to manufacture Aligner molds. In


addition, we use IMS, a
third party based in Juarez, Mexico, for the fabrication and packaging of
Aligners. Our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of
management to effectively manage these international operations, including our
relationship with IMS. In addition, we currently are and will become
increasingly dependant on IMS’s and our ability to hire and retain employees
generally, as well as hire and retain employees with the necessary skills to
perform the more technical aspects of our operations. If our management and/or
IMS fail in any of these respects, we could experience production delays and
lost or delayed revenue. In addition, even if we have case submissions in the
manufacturing backlog, if for these or other reasons we do not have sufficient
number of trained dental technicians in Costa Rica to create the ClinCheck
treatment forms or if IMS is unable to ship our product to our customers on a
timely basis, our revenue will be delayed or lost which will cause our
operating results to fluctuate.

See Part I,
Item 1A—Risk Factors for risks related to our international operations

.

Stock-based compensation.

Effective January 1,
2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(Revised 2004), “Share-based Payment” (“FAS 123R”) using the modified
prospective transition method, which requires the measurement and recognition
of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our
employees and directors and employee stock purchases related to the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan based on estimated fair values over the requisite service
period. In accordance with the modified prospective method, our financial
statements for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not
include the impact of FAS 123R. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
stock-based compensation expense recognized in accordance with FAS 123R is as

Revenues:

Our total net revenues decreased by $0.7 million or
0.4% to $206.4 million in 2006 compared to $207.1 million in 2005. The decline
in total net revenues resulted from reduced revenues in the orthodontic channel
offset by increases in the GP channel, international and other revenues. In
2006, the domestic orthodontic and GP channels were impacted by lower overall
average selling prices due to new pricing initiatives and the full-year effect
of our lower-priced Invisalign Express product, all of which were introduced in
the second half of 2005.

Invisalign
Express was launched in the third quarter of 2005.

Revenues from our domestic orthodontic channel
decreased $16.8 million or 19.6% in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of a
decline in full Invisalign revenues of $24.3 million partially offset by a $7.5
million increase in Invisalign Express revenues. The decline in full Invisalign
revenues is attributed to lower average selling prices and case volumes. In
2006 the reduced average selling price of the full Invisalign product reflects
the full year impact of pricing initiatives introduced in the second half of
2005, including the reduction in the list price of our full Invisalign product
and the expansion of our volume based discount program. Additionally, the
increase in Invisalign Express revenue resulted from higher case volumes in
2006 compared to 2005, since this product was launched in the third quarter of
2005.

Revenues from our domestic GP channel increased $4.8
million or 5.3% in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in Invisalign
Express revenues of $12.4 million partially offset by a $7.6 million


decline in full Invisalign
revenues. Invisalign Express revenues increased resulting from higher case
volumes in 2006 compared to 2005, since 
this product was launched in the third quarter of 2005. The reduction in
full Invisalign revenues is attributed to lower average selling prices which
reflect the full year impact of the pricing initiatives mentioned above.

International revenues increased $8.9 million or 38.3%
in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a significant increase in our
international Invisalign case volumes partially offset by a lower average
selling price as a result of pricing initiatives introduced in the first
quarter of 2006.

Other revenues, which primarily consisted of training
and sales of ancillary products, increased $2.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared
to 2005 mainly due to a $1.8 million increase in training revenues resulting
from an increase in training fees.

Net revenue grew by 19.8% for the year ended December 31,
2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The growth in net
revenues resulted primarily from an increase in overall case shipment volume in
the domestic GP channel driven by an increase in the number of participating
clinicians and the launch of Invisalign Express in the third quarter of 2005.
Additionally, our international sales improved primarily as a result of
increased number of participating clinicians and case utilization by our
European practitioners.

For fiscal year 2007, we
expect our total net revenues will increase compared to 2006 primarily due to
the anticipated case volume increases in our domestic orthodontic and GP
channels, as well as in international markets. We expect our average selling
price to be flat to slightly lower compared to 2006 primarily due to increased
participation in our volume based discount programs.

Cost of revenues includes salaries for staff involved
in the production process, costs incurred by IMS, a third party  shelter service provider in Juarez, Mexico,
the cost of materials, packaging, shipping costs, depreciation on capital
equipment used in the production process, training costs and stock-based
compensation expense.

Gross margin decreased to 68.6% of net revenues in
2006 compared to 69.2% in 2005 primarily due to lower average selling prices.
This decline in average selling prices is attributable to the reduction in the
list price of full Invisalign and increased sales of our lower priced
Invisalign Express product. Reductions in product costs driven by increased
volumes and manufacturing efficiencies including the relocation of the SLA mold
operations to Juarez, Mexico, partially offset the impact of lower average selling
prices. In addition, as a result of these efficiencies, we also released  a $2.2 million provision for estimated losses
on case refinement sales during fiscal 2006.

Gross margin improved to 69.2% of net revenues for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 66.7% of net revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2004. This improvement in gross margin is
primarily the result of cost savings achieved from manufacturing process
improvements and increased cost absorption due to higher production volumes
partially offset by increased training costs as a result of dental
professionals auditing training classes for no charge.


For the fiscal year 2007,
we anticipate that our gross margin will be slightly higher compared to 2006
primarily due to impact of the expected increase in case volume and
manufacturing efficiencies including a full year effect of the relocation of
the SLA mold operations to Juarez, Mexico.

Sales and marketing expense includes sales force
compensation (combined with travel related costs and expenses for professional
marketing programs), conducting workshops and market surveys, advertising,
dental professional trade show attendance and stock-based compensation expense.

Sales and marketing expense increased $1.9 million in
2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in payroll
expense mainly attributable to an increase in headcount and the replacement of
orthodontic sales representatives who left Align in the first half of 2005, and
a $2.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. These increases
were partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in media, advertising and
other marketing expenses due to the initial launch of our consumer marketing
campaign in the second quarter of 2005.

Sales and marketing expense increased by $24.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31,
2004. This increase was primarily related to incremental headcount which
resulted in higher payroll costs of $10.3 million, $6.7 million related to
increased advertising, media and trade show costs, an additional $4.8 million
on outside services and other sales and marketing support costs, and $2.4
million of expenses attributable to retention incentives and guarantees paid to
our sales force in response to the solicitation of our sales force by
OrthoClear during the first quarter of 2005.

For fiscal 2007, we expect
sales and marketing expense, including stock-based compensation, to be slightly
higher than 2006, as we expand our international markets, continue to increase
our investment in media programs and provide clinical education.

General and
administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel, outside

General  and
administrative expense increased by $22.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005
primarily due to a $15.0 million increase in external legal fees primarily
related to the OrthoClear litigation, a $3.8 million increase in payroll
related expenses primarily resulting from the hiring of additional legal and
administrative staff, and a $4.0 million increase in stock-based compensation
expense. Partially offsetting these increases was a $0.8 million decrease in
bad debt expense.


General and administrative expense increased by $8.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended
December 31, 2004 primarily due to incremental expenses related to the
OrthoClear litigation, which included a $5.8 million increase in external legal
fees, a $1.3 million increase in consulting costs and a $3.2 million increase
in payroll expense for employee retention and the hiring of additional legal
staff. This increase was partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in stock-based
compensation expense in connection with the amortization of deferred
stock-based compensation related to option grants prior to 2001.

For fiscal year 2007, we
expect that general and administrative expense will decrease from fiscal 2006
primarily as a result of the significant reduction in legal and other expenses
following the settlement agreement we entered into with OrthoClear in the
fourth quarter of 2006.

Research and development expense includes the

trials and stock-based compensation expense. We expense our research and
development costs as they are incurred.

Research and development expense decreased $0.1
million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to a $1.4 million decrease in
temporary services and outside consulting expenses partially offset by $1.3
million increase in stock-based compensation.

Research and development expense increased by $2.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31,
2004. The primary reasons for the higher expenses in 2005, compared to 2004,
were an increase of $1.3 million in outside service and consulting expenses,
$1.1 million of additional payroll related costs due to higher headcount and a
$0.4 million increase in training and other research and development expenses.

For fiscal 2007, we expect
research and development spending to increase from fiscal 2006 as we continue
to invest in research and development efforts to bring new products to market,
conduct clinical research and focus on product improvement initiatives.

Patients First Program and settlement costs consisted
of a $8.3 million charge for anticipated costs of Patients First Program combined
with $6.0 million in settlement cost, for a total of $14.3 million. This amount
is separately disclosed on our December 31, 2006 Consolidated Statement of
Operations.

As part of the OrthoClear Agreement, OrthoClear agreed
to stop the importation of aligners into the United States and discontinue all
aligner business operations worldwide. As a result, most OrthoClear patients
were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with OrthoClear. In an
attempt to help


minimize treatment
disruptions for the OrthoClear patients and their doctors, we committed to make
treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the “Patients
First Program”. We will receive no revenue for the program, and will incur
significant expense to complete these cases.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded an
$8.3 million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program

in

accordance
with FASB Statement 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”).  This amount is based on the number of
OrthoClear cases registered under the Patients First Program as of December 31,
2006 and the estimated costs that will be incurred to fulfill our obligations
as a result of this program. If the actual number of OrthoClear cases under the
program changes or the actual costs differs significantly from our estimates,
we would be required to adjust the accrual for the Patients First Program, and
it could materially impact our financial statements. We currently anticipate
that we will be able to complete the Patients First Program by the end of the
second quarter of fiscal 2007.

We paid $20.0 million to
OrthoClear during the fourth quarter of 2006 in accordance with the terms of
the OrthoClear Agreement, of which $14.0 million was capitalized on our balance
sheet representing the fair value of the non-compete agreements and is being
amortized over 5 years. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 04-01
“Accounting for Pre-existing Contractual Relationships between the Parties to a
Purchase Business Combination” (EITF 04-01), we recorded the remaining
$6.0 million as settlement costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.

Interest and other income (expense), net, includes
interest income earned on cash balances, interest expense on debt, foreign
currency translation gains and losses for the dollar against other currencies
related to international businesses and other miscellaneous charges.

Interest income (expense), net for the year ended December 31,
2006 increased $1.1 million compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to
increased interest income as a result of higher effective interest rates.

Other income (expense) increased $2.0 million in 2006
compared to 2005, primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in foreign currency
translation gains resulted primarily from the remeasurement of foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities.

Interest and other income
and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, included interest
income of $1.9 million, which resulted from higher interest rates and average
cash balances during 2005, offset by exchange losses of $1.0 million and $0.6
million of interest expense, bank charges and other expense.

We recorded an income tax provision of $0.8 million
for fiscal 2006, $1.3 million for fiscal 2005 and $1.0 million in fiscal 2004,
representing effective tax rates of -2.4%, 48.2% and 10.2% for 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, we have recorded a full
valuation allowance for our existing deferred tax assets due to uncertainties
about whether we will be able to utilize these assets before they expire. As a
result, our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each
taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that
we incur in each jurisdiction.

At December 31, 2006, we had net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $214.9 million for federal tax purposes and
$73.5 million for California state tax purposes. If not utilized, these
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 for federal purposes and 2007 for
California purposes.

SFAS
123R prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax
benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through
a reduction in income taxes payable. Such unrecognized deferred tax benefits
totaled $14.1 million as of December 31, 2006 and will be accounted for as
a credit to additional paid-in capital, if and when realized through a
reduction in income taxes payable. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual
limitation on the use of a corporation’s tax attributes if a corporation
undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes. If an ownership change is
determined to have occurred, our ability to use the net operating loss
carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation. However, based on our
current estimate of the total net operating losses at December 31, 2006
and our current estimate of the annual limitation, we do not expect our net
operating loss carryforwards to be limited. At December 31, 2006, we had
research credit carryforwards of approximately $4.0 million for federal
purposes and $5.4 million for California state tax purposes. If not utilized,
the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017. The California
state credit can be carried forward indefinitely.

We have not provided
additional U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings from non- U.S.
operations as of December 31, 2006 because such earnings are intended to
be reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

We
fund our operations from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock, from
cash generated from sales of our product and occasional borrowing under
available credit facilities. As of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we
had the following cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments:

Net cash used in operating activities for the year
ended December 31, 2006 was $14.0 million, resulting primarily from our
operating loss of $35.0 million adjusted for non-cash items such as
depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation totaling $19.2
million. Additionally, a $6.4 million increase in current assets and a $5.8
million reduction in deferred revenue partially offset by a $14.3 million
increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the
cash used in operating activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year
ended December 31, 2005, was $16.1 million, primarily from operating
profits adjusted for non cash items and increases in accrued liabilities
partially offset by reductions in accounts payable.


Net cash used in investing activities was $32.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to a $14.0
million purchase of intangible assets resulting from the OrthoClear Agreement,
$10.0 million for the purchase of capital assets and $8.9 million net purchase
of short-term marketable securities. We used $15.3 million of cash for our
investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2005. This
included $13.8 million of cash used to purchase capital assets, and $0.9
million of net cash used to purchase General Orthodontics, LLC.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $27.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and primarily consisted of
$16.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily from
exercises of employee stock options and $11.5 million in net proceeds from our
line of credit. Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2005, which consisted of proceeds from the
issuance of common stock, primarily from exercises of employee stock options,
partially offset by payments on debt obligations related to the equipment-based
term loan and capital lease obligations.

Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related
to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant
component of our liquidity. However, in 2006, we began granting RSUs which,
unlike stock options, do not generate cash from exercise. In addition, because
RSUs are taxable to the individuals when they vest, the number of shares we
issued to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable payroll
withholding taxes which taxes will be paid by us on their behalf. As a result,
we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common
stock in future periods.

In December 2005, we renegotiated and amended our
existing revolving line of credit to increase the available borrowings under
the then existing revolving line to $20.0 million. Included in the revolving
line of credit is a letter of credit facility of up to $5 million, a foreign
exchange facility of up to $5 million and an equipment facility of up to $10
million. We may elect interest rates on our borrowing calculated by reference
to bank’s prime rate less one-half of one percent or LIBOR plus two percent.
The credit facility matures on December 16, 2007, at which time all
outstanding borrowings must be repaid. The credit facility contains certain
restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, financial covenants
requiring a minimum quick ratio and minimum tangible net worth, and covenants
limiting our ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions, be acquired,
incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, pay dividends and repurchase
stock. In December 2006, we amended our credit agreement whereby the only
financial covenant for the fourth quarter of 2006 was a certain minimum cash
balance. As of December 31, 2006, we are in compliance with the financial
covenant of these credit facilities.

During the third
quarter of 2006, we borrowed $15.0 million against these credit facilities and
made a $20.0 million one-time payment to OrthoClear Holdings, Inc in accordance
with the terms of the OrthoClear Agreement. We elected LIBOR plus two percent
as an interest rate of 7.29% as of December 31, 2006. We repaid $3.5
million of this borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2006, the outstanding
balance as of December 31, 2006 was $11.5 million and is classified as
current liability.

On March 7, 2007, we renegotiated and amended our
existing credit facility with Comerica Bank. The amendment, among other things,
reduced financial covenants to require only a quick ratio covenant.
Additionally, the amendment also increased the available borrowings under the
existing revolving line of credit from $20 million to $25 million effective January 1,
2008. The amended credit facility matures on December 31, 2008 at which
point all outstanding borrowing under this credit facility must be repaid.

We have no significant contractual obligations not
fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the
notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K
Item 303(a)(4) as of December 31, 2006.

We expect that our expense levels for 2007 will remain
comparable to 2006, depending on our level of business activity.  We expect that any increases will be focused
on continued marketing and international sales efforts and research and
development expenses as we develop new products and improvements to our existing
products. In addition, we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary
businesses or technologies. Our capital requirements depend on market
acceptance of our products and our ability to market, sell and support our
products on a worldwide basis.

We believe that our
current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for
at least the next 12 months. If we are unable to generate adequate operating
cash flows, we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or
debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with other companies, bank
financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue
our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain
additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If
adequate funds are not available, we could be required to delay establishing a
national brand, building manufacturing infrastructure and developing our
product and process technology, and reduce our expenditures in general.
Accordingly, the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when
needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Critical Accounting
Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and
expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate
our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue
recognition, stock-based compensation and income taxes. We use authoritative
pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for
making estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

We believe the following
critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.


Revenue Recognition

We enter into arrangements
to sell products, services, and other arrangements that contain multiple
elements or multiple deliverables of products in the future. Revenues are
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable,
and collectibility is reasonably assured. 
Revenues from product sales, net of discounts and rebates, are
recognized upon shipment.  Service
revenues are recorded when performance is completed.  Other revenue arrangements with multiple
elements are recognized as delivery occurs.  We use vendor-specific objective evidence of
fair value to allocate revenue to the undelivered elements and recognize the
residual revenue for the delivered items upon shipment. Revenues for the
undelivered elements are deferred based on a historical case refinement
utilization rate, or breakage factor, and are recognized when delivery
occurs.  Actual utilization rates could
differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to
revenue. In addition, changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability
to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements
could affect the timing of revenue recognition but would not change the total
revenue recognized.

Stock-based
Compensation Expense

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the modified
prospective transition method of 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“FAS 123R”), which
requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock
options and restricted stock units related to our 2001 Plan and our 2005 Plan
and employee stock purchases related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan based
on estimated fair values over requisite employee service period. In accordance
with the modified prospective transition method, our financial statements for
prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact
of FAS 123R. Our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of FAS 123R related to share-based payment
awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005 based on
the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions
of FASB Statement 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS 123”)
and stock-based payment awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based on
the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS
123R. In conjunction with the adoption of FAS 123R, we changed our method of
attributing the value of stock-based compensation to expense from the
accelerated multiple-option approach to the straight-line single option method.

We estimate the fair value of stock options using a
Black-Scholes valuation model, consistent with the provisions of FAS 123R and
the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”). Option-pricing
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
option’s expected term and stock price volatility. Judgment is also required in
estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.
As stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to
vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. FAS 123R requires
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  Forfeitures were estimated based on
historical experience.  If our estimates
change or if we employ different assumptions in the application of FAS 123R in
future periods, the compensation expense that we record under FAS 123R may
differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could
materially impact our results of operations.

See Note 10
“Shareholders’ Equity” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

On October 6, 2005,
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the acceleration
of the vesting for all unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than
$7.10. Options held by non-employee directors were excluded from the vesting
acceleration. The fair market value of our


common
stock on the date of acceleration was $6.41 as quoted on the NASDAQ Global
Market. As a result of the acceleration, approximately 3.8 million options or
35% of the then total outstanding options became immediately exercisable as of
October 6, 2005. The purpose of the acceleration was to eliminate future
compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of
operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of FAS
123R.

Long-lived assets,
including finite lived purchased intangible assets

Intangible assets other
than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives, unless these lives are
determined to be indefinite. Intangible assets are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful
life of the respective asset. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets

(“FAS 144”). We perform an impairment test
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or circumstances
include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future
operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets
or the strategy for its business, significant negative industry or economic
trends, and/or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period.
Impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of
the asset and its carrying value, and fair value is generally measured based on
discounted cash flow analyses. No intangible asset impairment was recorded for
the periods presented.

Patients First
Program

As part of the OrthoClear
Settlement Agreement, OrthoClear agreed to stop the importation of aligners
into the United States and discontinue all aligner business operations
worldwide. As a result, most OrthoClear patients were unable to complete their
orthodontic treatment with OrthoClear. 
In an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the OrthoClear
patients and their doctors, we committed to make treatment available to these
patients at no additional cost under the “Patients First Program”.  We will receive no revenue for the program,
and will incur significant expense to complete these cases.   In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded s
$8.3 million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program in
accordance with FASB Statement 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”).
This amount is based on the number of OrthoClear cases registered under the
Patients First Program as of December 31, 2006 and the estimated costs that
will be incurred to fulfill our obligations as a result of this program. If the
actual number of OrthoClear cases under the program changes or the actual costs
differs significantly from our estimates, we would be required to adjust the
accrual for the Patients First Program, and it could materially impact our financial
statements. We currently anticipate that we will be able to complete the
Patients First Program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

Product Warranty

We warrant our products
against defects in materials and workmanship until the Invisalign case is
completed. We accrue for estimated warranty in costs of goods sold upon the
shipment of products. The amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are
primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as
current information on repair costs. Actual warranty costs could differ from
the estimated amounts. We regularly review the accrued balances and update
these balances based on historical warranty cost trends. Actual warranty costs
incurred have not materially differed from those accrued. If we were to
experience higher rates of warranty events, we would be required to accrue
additional warranty costs, which would negatively affect our operating results.


Deferred Tax
Valuation Allowance

We have established a full valuation allowance because
we believe the realization of our deferred tax assets is not likely.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are based
on temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items
for tax and accounting purposes.  These
differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our
balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be realized.  To the extent we
believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.

While we have considered
future taxable income in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance,
we would decrease the valuation allowance to take into account deferred tax
assets that we could realize.  A decrease
in the valuation allowance could have a favorable impact, which could be
material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we
make the decrease.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a
full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected
dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial
condition, which is incorporated herein.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of
business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate
risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations.

Interest Rate Risk

Changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated
interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable equity
securities. Due to the short duration of our cash and cash equivalents an
immediate 10% decrease or more in interest rates would not have a material
adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows. Periodically we
invest our excess cash in low risk and short-term available for sale marketable
equity securities. These investments are primarily at fixed interest rates. As
of December 31, 2006, we had $8.9 million investments in available for sale
marketable equity securities.

As of December 31, 2006,
we had $11.5 million outstanding borrowing against our line of credit, which
bears interest rate of LIBOR plus two percent being 7.29% as of December 31,
2006 and are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases. An
increase of 10% or more in interest rates may affect our future cost of
financing. In the past we had used fixed rates long-term financing to minimize our
risk on interest rates increases.

Currency Rate Risk

The functional currency of Align and its subsidiaries
is the U.S. dollar and, accordingly, gains and losses resulting from the
translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Euro, Cost Rican
Colon, and other currencies are reflected in the determination of net income or
loss. We do not enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to
foreign exchange gains and losses. Included in other income (expense) for the year
ended December 31, 2006, was an exchanges gain of $1.1 million. For years 2005
and 2004 we experienced exchange loss of $1.0 million and an exchange gain of
$0.3 million, respectively, primarily related to Euro denominated balances. An
aggregate decline of 10% in foreign currency exchange rates relative to USD may
have an adverse effect of approximately $1.2 million on our results of
operations and financial position.

REPORT OF
MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Align
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Align’s internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

·

pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

·

provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and

·

provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Align’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In
making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based on its assessment and those criteria, management
has concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, Align’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Align’s
independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has
issued an audit report on our assessment of Align’s internal control of
financial reporting. Their report may be found immediately after this report.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Align
Technology, Inc. and subsidiaries:

We have completed
integrated audits of Align Technology, Inc.’s consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the index under item 15(a)(i) present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Align Technology, Inc.
and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under
item 15(a)(ii) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in
Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed the
manner in which it accounts for stock-based compensation in fiscal 2006.

Internal control
over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment,
included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing immediately above this report, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore,
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control
over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.


A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ALIGN TECHNOLOGY,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.   Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Business
Description

Align Technology, Inc.
(“Align” or the “Company”) was incorporated in April 1997 and is engaged
in the development, manufacturing and marketing of Invisalign, used for
treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign uses a series
of clear plastic “Aligners” to move the patients’ teeth in small increments
from their original state to a final treated state.

Basis of
presentation and preparation

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.

Use of estimates
and reclassifications

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from those
estimates.

Certain reclassifications
have been made to prior period reported amounts to conform to the current year
presentation.

Fair value of
financial instruments

The carrying amounts of
the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and other current liabilities approximate the fair value. The carrying value of
marketable securities approximates their fair value as determined by market
quotes. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for debt
with similar terms, the carrying value of its debt obligations approximates
fair value.

Cash equivalents
and marketable securities

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. The Company
invests primarily in money market funds, commercial paper, and United States
government securities, accordingly, these investments are subject to minimal
credit and market risks.

Marketable securities are
classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Marketable
securities classified as current assets have maturities of less than one year. Unrealized
holding gains or losses on such securities are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses
on sales of all such securities are reported in earnings and computed using the
specific identification cost method. Realized gains or losses and charges for
other-than-temporary declines in value, if any, on available-for-sale
securities are reported in other income or expense as incurred. The Company
periodically evaluates these investments for other-than-temporary impairment.

Restricted cash

The Company’s restricted
cash as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $0.1 million and $0.2 million,
respectively, primarily comprised of security against a leasing arrangement in
Europe.


Foreign currency

The Company analyzes the
functional currency determination for its international subsidiaries on an
annual basis, or more often if necessary. For the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company and its subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as
its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for
monetary assets and liabilities, and historical exchange rates for non-monetary
assets and liabilities.

Revenues
and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each
period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in
other income (expense). For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, the Company included in other income (expense) a gain of $1.1 million, a
loss of $1.0 million and a gain of $0.3 million, respectively.

Certain risks and
uncertainties

The Company’s operating results depend to a
significant extent on the Company’s ability to market and develop its products.
The life cycles of the Company’s products are difficult to estimate due in part
to the effect of future product enhancements and competition. The inability of
the Company to successfully develop and market its products as a result of
competition or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Financial instruments which potentially expose the
Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents
and accounts receivable. The Company invests excess cash primarily in money
market funds of major financial institutions, commercial paper and notes. The
Company provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. Collateral
is not required for accounts receivable, but ongoing evaluations of customers’
credit worthiness are performed. The Company maintains reserves for potential
credit losses and such losses have been within management’s expectations. No
individual customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s accounts
receivable at December 31, 2006 and 2005, or net revenues in fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004.

In the United States of America, the Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”) regulates the design, manufacture, distribution,
preclinical and clinical study, clearance and approval of medical devices. Products
developed by the Company may require approvals or clearances from the FDA or
other international regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales. There
can be no assurance that the Company’s products will receive any of the
required approvals or clearances. If the Company was denied approval or
clearance or such approval was delayed, it may have a material adverse impact
on the Company.

The Company has manufacturing operations located
outside the United States of America. The Company currently relies on its
manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica to create virtual treatment plans with
the assistance of sophisticated software. In addition, the Company relies on a
third party shelter services provider in Juarez, Mexico to fabricate Aligners
and to ship the completed product to the Company’s customers. The Company’s
reliance on international operations exposes it to related risks and
uncertainties, including difficulties in staffing and managing international
operations; controlling quality of manufacture; political, social and economic
instability; interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services;
product and/or material transportation delays or disruption; trade restrictions
and changes in tariffs; import and export license requirements and
restrictions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and potential adverse
tax consequences. If any of these risks materialize, the Company’s
international manufacturing operations, as well as its operating results, may
be harmed.

The Company receives
certain of its components from sole suppliers. Additionally, the Company relies
on a limited number of hardware manufacturers. The inability of any supplier or
manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could materially
impact future operating results.


Inventories

Inventories are valued at
standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in,
first-out basis, not in excess of market value.

Property and
equipment

Property and equipment are
stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon sale or retirement, the asset’s cost
and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the general ledger and
any related gain or loss is reflected in operations. Maintenance and repairs
are charged to operations as incurred.

Development costs
for internal use software

Costs relating to internal
use software are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of Statement
of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use (SOP 98-1). In 2004, the Company implemented a new
version of its enterprise resource planning system and new software for the
Company’s manufacturing execution system and capitalized approximately $3.2
million in related internal use software costs. As of December 31, 2006,
and 2005, capitalized internal use software at cost was $4.7 million and $4.4
million, respectively. The associated accumulated amortization was $3.5 million
and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the
software, which generally range from three to five years.

Acquisition

In January 2005, the
Company acquired all the membership interests of privately held General
Orthodontics, LLC (“GO”).  The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the operating
results of GO have been included in the consolidated financial statements since
date of acquisition.

See Note 5 “Acquisitions”
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and
identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill
is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances
occur which indicate that goodwill might be impaired.

Long-lived assets,
including finite lived purchased intangible assets

Other intangible assets primarily consist of
intangible assets purchased as part of the OrthoClear Agreement and GO
acquisition. These assets are amortized using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives of three to five years, reflecting the period in
which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized.

The Company regularly
monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate if the
carrying values of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be
recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company
assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the
carrying value of such assets will be recovered through future net undiscounted
cash flows. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by


the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value, as
measured by the discounted future cash flows.

Product Warranty

The Company warrants its
products against material defects until the Invisalign case is completed. The
Company accrues for estimated warranty in costs of goods sold upon shipment of
products. The amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are primarily based on
historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on
repair costs. Actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts.
The Company regularly reviews the accrued balances and updates these balances based
on historical warranty cost trends. Actual warranty costs incurred have not
materially differed from those accrued.

Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains
allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of the Company’s customers to make payments. The Company periodically
reviews these estimated allowances, including an analysis of the customers’
payment history and information regarding the customers’ creditworthiness.
Actual doubtful account write-offs have not materially differed from the
estimated allowance.

Revenue Recognition

Align recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104 “Revenue Recognition” (“SAB 104”), and
Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-21 “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). SAB 104 requires that four basic criteria must be
met before revenue can be recognized: 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the
price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Determination
of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery
has occurred or services rendered involve management’s judgments based on
whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated
with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or
adjustment.

Revenue from product sales, net of discounts and
rebates, is recognized upon shipment. Service revenues related to the training
of dental professionals and staff on the Invisalign treatment process, and case
consultations are recorded when the services are completed.

Align enters into multiple element arrangements that
involve delivery of products in the future. Included in the price of a full
Invisalign treatment, the Company offers case refinement, which is a finishing
tool used to adjust a patient’s teeth to the final desired position. Case
refinement may be elected by the dental professional in the last stages of
orthodontic treatment. The Company uses vendor specific objective evidence of
fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement deliverable and
recognizes the residual revenue for full Invisalign upon shipment. Through June 2005,
Align deferred the fair value of case refinement for each full Invisalign case
shipped. For these full Invisalign cases, case refinement revenue is recognized
upon shipment or case expiration, whichever occurs earlier. A full Invisalign
case is deemed expired six months after the expected end of treatment. Since
the third quarter of fiscal 2005, Align defers the fair value of case
refinement upon shipment of full Invisalign based on a breakage factor, which
is determined by sufficient historical experience of case refinement
utilization. The Company believes that the use of a breakage factor is
reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of case refinement
utilization since case refinement was first offered. The Company has seen no
material changes in the breakage factor in the reporting periods presented.


The Company estimates and
records a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales, if any, in the
period such sales occur. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are
provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded
based upon historical discounts and rebates.

Shipping and
Handling Costs

Shipping and handling
charges to customers are included in the net revenue, and the associated cost
incurred recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented.

Research and development

Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred.

Advertising costs

The cost of advertising
and media is expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 advertising costs totaled $9.2 million, $11.3 million and $6.3
million respectively.

Income taxes

We estimate our income
taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant
judgment is required in determining our income tax provision. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for differing treatments of certain items
for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred
tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not
likely, we establish a valuation allowance.

Stock-based
compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS 123”) No. 123 (Revised
2004), Share-Based Payment (“FAS
123R”), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense
for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including
stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchases related to
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on estimated fair values of these awards
over the requisite employee service period. FAS 123R supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (“APB 25”), which the Company
previously followed in accounting for stock-based awards. In March 2005,
the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”) to provide guidance on FAS 123R. The
Company has applied SAB 107 in its adoption of FAS 123R.

Under the provisions of FAS 123R, the Company adopted
the modified prospective transition method which requires stock-based
compensation cost to be recognized for share-based payments awards granted to,
but not yet vested as of, December 31, 2005 based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of FASB Statement
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS 123”) and stock-based
payment awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based on the grant
date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R. In accordance
with the modified prospective transition method, the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006
reflects the impact of FAS 123R, and prior periods have not been restated to
reflect, and do not include the impact of FAS 123R. In conjunction with the
adoption of FAS 123R, the Company changed its method of attributing the value
of stock-based compensation from accelerated multiple-option approach to the
straight-line single method.

In November 2005, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123(R)-3,
“Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based
Payment Awards” (“FSP 123R-3”). The Company has elected to adopt the
alternative transition method provided in


the
FSP 123R-3 that includes simplified methods to establish the beginning
balance of the additional paid-in capital pool related to the tax effect of
stock-based compensation and to determine the subsequent impact on the
additional paid-in capital pool and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
for stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon the adoption of
FAS 123R.

See Note 10 “Shareholders’ Equity” of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information

.

Comprehensive
Income (loss)

Comprehensive income
(loss), as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period
from non-owner sources. Net profit (loss) and other comprehensive (loss),
including unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments, are reported,
net of their related tax effect.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
(“FIN”) No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement 109”. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model
for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial
statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return,
including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular
jurisdiction. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2006. If there are changes in net assets as a result of application of FIN 48,
these will be accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings. The Company
does not expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material impact on its
results from operations or consolidated financial position.

In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 108 “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements” (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires that public companies utilize a “dual-approach”
to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements. This dual
approach includes both an income statement focused assessment and a balance
sheet focused assessment. The guidance in SAB 108 must be applied to annual
financial statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The
adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on its results from
operations or consolidated financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement
No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

,
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FASB
Statement No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require
or permit fair value measurements. The new guidance is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 157
on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the
FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants and the SEC did not or are not believed by
management to have a material impact on our present or future consolidated
financial statements.


Note 2.   Patients
First Program and settlement costs

On October 13, 2006, the Company entered into a
formal agreement with OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear Holdings, Inc.,
and OrthoClear Pakistan Pvt. Ltd. (“OrthoClear”), together with certain
individuals associated with OrthoClear (the “OrthoClear Agreement”) to end all
pending litigation between the parties. In addition, OrthoClear agreed, among
other things, to stop accepting new patient cases for treatment, consent to the
entry of an exclusion order by the ITC prohibiting the importation of
OrthoClear aligners into the United States, assign and transfer to Align all
intellectual property rights with application to the correction of malocclusion
and discontinue all design, manufacture, marketing and sales of removable
dental aligners worldwide. In addition, certain OrthoClear principles also
signed five year non-compete agreements.

See Note 7 “Legal
Proceedings” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more
complete summary of the OrthoClear Agreement.

The Company evaluated
this transaction under the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force 98-3 “Determining
Whether a Non-Monetary Transaction Involves a Receipt of Productive Assets or
of a Business” (EITF 98-3) and concluded that this transaction is not a
business acquisition and will be accounted for as an asset purchase.

In accordance with the terms of the OrthoClear
Agreement, the Company made a $20.0 million one-time cash payment to OrthoClear
Holdings, Inc. on October 16, 2006. The Company engaged a third-party
firm to assist management in assessing the fair value of the identifiable
assets received in conjunction with the OrthoClear Agreement. Using an income
valuation approach, it was determined that $14.0 million represented the fair
value of the non-compete agreements, which are being amortized over the
estimated useful life of 5 years. The intellectual property transferred to
Align was determined not to have any alternative future use and therefore had
no fair value. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 04-01 “Accounting
for Pre-existing Contractual Relationships between the Parties to a Purchase
Business Combination” (EITF 04-01), the remaining $6.0 million of the $20.0
million payment was recorded as settlement costs.

As part of the OrthoClear
Agreement, OrthoClear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the
United States and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide. As a
result, most OrthoClear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic
treatment with OrthoClear. In an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions
for the OrthoClear patients and their doctors, the Company committed to make
treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the “Patients
First Program”. Therefore, Align will receive no revenue for the program, while
incurring significant expense.  In the
fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a $8.3 million charge for the
anticipated costs of completing the Patients First Program in

accordance with FASB Statement 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies” (“FAS 5”). This amount is based on the number of OrthoClear
cases registered under the Patients First Program as of December 31, 2006
and the estimated costs that will be incurred in order to fulfill the
obligation as a result of this program. If the actual number of OrthoClear
cases under the program changes or the actual- costs differ significantly from
our estimates, Align would be required to adjust the accrual for the Patients
First Program, and it could materially impact the financial statements. As December 31,
2006, $6.8 million remained in accrued liabilities for this program. Align
currently anticipates that the Patients First Program will be completed by the
end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

Note 5.

Acquisitions

In January 2005,
the Company acquired all of the membership interests of privately held General
Orthodontics, LLC (“GO”). GO is the sole premier provider of consulting and
education services to general practitioner dentists (“GP”) and orthodontists
using the Invisalign orthodontic appliance. Upon the integration of GO, Align
included GO’s consulting services in its clinical education and training
programs under the name of Invisalign Consulting Services. The consolidated
financial statements include the operating results of GO from the date of
acquisition.

The purchase price of $1.3 million was accounted for
as a business combination and allocated to the acquired assets, goodwill and
other identified intangibles, as follows (in thousands):

The valuation of
the consultant relationships represent the fair value of consultant services
which include direct consulting services to GO’s customers on the use of the
Invisalign technology and training of GP dentists and orthodontists at the
Company’s certification training sessions. Consultant relationships and other
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of three years.

In accordance with the Membership Interest Purchase
Agreement, the Company agreed to contingent earn-outs of up to $1.0 million
payable to certain former holders of GO membership interests upon the
achievement of milestones defined in the agreement. These contingent payments
were accrued on a


straight-line basis based
on the estimated completion dates. The Company paid $0.5 million related to
milestone completion in July 2005, and the remaining $0.5 million in April 2006.

In conjunction with the GO
acquisition, the Company recorded $0.5 million of goodwill, which
represents  the difference between the
purchase price and the fair value of the acquired net assets and the identified
intangible assets. As required by FASB Statement 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), the Company performs its annual impairment test
in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of
potential impairment exist, to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired. In
performing this assessment, Align compared the fair value of its single
business segment to its carrying value, and determined that no goodwill
impairment existed as of December 31, 2006.

Non-compete agreements represent the fair value of
assets received in conjunction with the OrthoClear Agreement. These intangible
assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful
life of five years beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006.

See Note 2 “Patients First Program and settlement costs” of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Consultant relationships and other intangible assets
represent the fair value of intangible assets acquired as the result of the GO
acquisition in 2005. Consultant relationships and other intangible assets are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of
three years.

See Note 5 “Acquisitions” of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The Company performs an impairment test whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may
not be recoverable. Examples of such events or circumstances include
significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future
operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets
or the strategy for its business, significant negative industry or economic
trends, and/or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period.
Impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of
the asset and its carrying value, and fair value is generally measured based on
discounted cash flow analyses. No intangible asset impairment was recorded for
the periods presented.


For
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total amortization
expense for intangible assets was $1.0 million, $0.4 million and $36,000,
respectively. The total estimated annual future amortization expense for these
intangible assets is as follows (in thousands):

Proceedings

OrthoClear

State
Action.

On
February 2, 2005, the Company filed a multi-claim lawsuit in San Francisco
County Superior Court against defendants OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear
Holdings, Inc., Muhammad Ziaullah Chishti, Bao Tran, Peter Riepenhausen,
Joe Breeland, Jeff Tunnell, Christopher Kawaja, and Charles Wen (the “State
Action”). Among other things, the State Action alleged tort, contract,
statutory and common law causes of action arising from OrthoClear and the
individual defendants’ alleged plan to unlawfully utilize the Company’s
intellectual property, confidential information and employees. The State Action
also alleged that OrthoClear, Chishti and other defendants were in breach of
contractual obligations, statutory law and common law for attempting to
intentionally interfere and disrupt the Company’s ongoing business operations
and improperly gain access to its customer relationships and trade secrets. Subsequent
to the initial filing date, there were extensive proceedings in the case as
reported in previous Align filings.

Federal
Lanham Action.

On July 19, 2005 and June 19,
2006, the Company filed a multi-claim lawsuit in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California against OrthoClear (the “Federal
Lanham Action I” and “Federal Lanham Action II”, respectively). The Federal
Lanham Action I and Federal Lanham Action II alleged numerous violations of the
Federal Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. §1051 et seq.) by OrthoClear and its officers and
employees. These violations include unfair competition, trademark infringement
and false advertising, among other things. The Federal Lanham Action I and
Federal Lanham Action II also alleged violations by OrthoClear of California’s
Unfair Practices Act (California Business and Professions Code §17200 et seq.).

Patent
Infringement ITC Complaint.

On January 11,
2006, the Company filed a formal complaint with the United States International
Trade Commission (ITC) against OrthoClear, seeking to halt the importation into
the United States of infringing certain patents of the Company.

Patent Infringement
Federal Action.

On January 11, 2006, the
Company filed a federal court patent infringement action against OrthoClear in
the Western District of Wisconsin (Madison) (the “Patent Infringement Federal
Action”) asserting infringement of certain patents of the Company.

OrthoClear
Agreement

On October 13,
2006, the Company and OrthoClear, Inc., OrthoClear Holdings, Inc.,
and OrthoClear Pakistan Pvt. Ltd. (“OrthoClear”), together with certain
individuals associated with OrthoClear, executed a formal agreement (the “OrthoClear
Agreement”). The OrthoClear Agreement included the following terms:

·

OrthoClear was required
immediately discontinue all design, manufacture, marketing and sales of
removable dental aligners worldwide;


·

OrthoClear consented to the
entry of an exclusion order by the ITC, enforced by the United States Customs
Service, which prevents OrthoClear from importing its dental aligner products
into the U.S., either directly or through a third party and the ITC
subsequently terminated the ITC action on October 27, 2006;

·

The parties agreed to
dismiss all pending lawsuits against each other, including the State Case,
Federal Lanham Action I, Federal Lanham Action II, Patent Infringement Federal
Action, with prejudice, and each such action has been subsequently dismissed;

·

OrthoClear agreed to stop
accepting new patient cases for treatment;

·

OrthoClear and Muhammad
Ziaullah Chishti its CEO, and Charles Wen, its President,  transferred and assigned to Align all
intellectual property rights with application to the treatment of malocclusion;

·

OrthoClear principals
Muhammad Ziaullah Chishti, Charles Wen, Peter Riepenhausen, and Christopher
Kawaja signed 5-year, global non-compete agreements in the field of removable
aligner therapy products and related software market;

·

OrthoClear employees Joe
Breeland and Jeff Tunnell signed 5-year U.S. non-compete agreements prohibiting
their personal participation in the removable aligner therapy product and
related software market;

·

The Company made Invisalign
treatment available to OrthoClear patients in the United States, Canada and
Hong Kong at no charge from Align. The Company implemented this program as the
Patients First Program.

In accordance with the
terms of the OrthoClear Agreement, on October 16, 2006, the Company made a
one-time cash payment of $20.0 million to OrthoClear Holdings, Inc.

See Note 2 “Patients First Programs and settlement costs” of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on Patients First Program

.

Ormco

On January 6, 2003, Ormco Corporation  (“Ormco”) filed suit against the Company in
the United States District Court for the Central District, Orange County
Division, asserting infringement of certain patents. Ormco is a division of
Sybron Dental Specialties. In May 2006, Danaher Corporation acquired
Sybron Dental Specialties. The complaint sought unspecified monetary damages
and injunctive relief. On February 18, 2003, The Company answered the
complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity
and non-infringement of the asserted patents. In addition, the Company
counterclaimed for infringement of one of its patents, seeking unspecified
monetary damages and injunctive relief. Ormco filed a reply to its
counterclaims on March 10, 2003 and asserted counterclaims against the
Company seeking a declaration by the Court of invalidity and non-infringement
of the patent. The Company amended its counterclaim to add Allesee Orthodontic
Appliances, Inc. (“AOA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ormco, as a
counterdefendant in regard to its counterclaim of infringement of the patent.

On February 1, 2006, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Ormco and AOA. In
accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Ormco and AOA  paid into escrow, pending the completion of
the appellate process, $884,000 to resolve the issues of past damages,
willfulness and attorneys’ fees for the adjudged infringement of two of the
Company’s patents  (the “Align Patents”)
through the manufacture and sale of Ormco’s and AOA’s Red, White &
Blue appliances. The Company’s receipt of the payments out of escrow is
contingent upon the Court, in a final, non-appealable judgment, finding that
Ormco or AOA infringes at least one of the claims


in the Align Patents. If,
however, the Court issues a final, non-appealable judgment of non-infringement,
invalidity or unenforceability with respect to each asserted claim of the Align
Patents, all funds in the escrow account will be returned to Ormco and AOA. The
Settlement Agreement does not affect (a) Ormco’s appeal of the decisions
and orders of the District Court relating to Ormco’s patents; or (2) our
pending cross-appeal of the orders of the District Court relating to our
patents.

There have been two appeals. After the Permanent
injunction was entered, Ormco and AOA appealed that injunction and the orders
of the District Court on summary judgment on which that order was based. Oral
argument took place on April 3, 2006.  Following oral argument, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) issued a ruling declaring two out of a
total of seventy-one claims in our US Patent No. 6,398,548 and four out of
a total of ten claims in US Patent No. 6,544,611 to be invalid as “obvious.”
The CAFC’s decision reverses the California District Court summary judgment
order of validity.

The second appeal is from
the final judgment. Once final judgment was entered, Ormco filed a Notice of
Appeal from the final judgment and the Company filed a notice of cross-appeal. Ormco
has appealed the ruling of the District Court that its patents are not
infringed by the Company and that the asserted claims are invalid. The Company
appealed the ruling of the District Court that certain claims of its 6,398,548
patent which were found to be infringed by Ormco’s and AOA’s Red, White &
Blue appliances were invalid. Briefing on this appeal and cross-appeal is
complete, and oral argument occurred on February 6, 2007.

Bay
Materials

On July 25, 2005, Bay Materials, LLC (“Bay”)
filed suit against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California
for the County of San Mateo. The complaint, as amended, asserts, among other
things, breach of contract, promissory estoppel and fraud. Bay alleges that we
breached the terms of a purchase order by failing to pay for unshipped goods
manufactured by Bay pursuant to such order. Bay further alleges that the
Company promised to purchase from Bay an alternative polyurethane product, and
Bay relied on this representation to develop such an alternative product which
the Company determined not to use. The complaint seeks monetary damages of $1.1
million related to breach of contract and research and development costs
incurred plus unspecified damages related to lost profit, punitive and
exemplary damages, and legal expenses. On March 27, 2006, the Company
filed its answer to Bay’s amended complaint, and also filed a cross-complaint
against Bay for breach of contract, breach of implied warranty of fitness,
intentional misrepresentation, concealment, specific performance, unjust
enrichment and unfair business practices. The cross-complaint seeks monetary
damages against Bay exceeding $1.0 million. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the
parties agreed to settle their dispute and dismiss all claims and cross-claims
against each other in exchange for a one time payment by the Company to Bay in
the amount of $750,000.

Litigating claims of these
types, whether or not ultimately determined in the Company’s favor or settled
by the Company, is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of the Company’s
management and technical personnel from normal business operations. Any of
these results from litigation could adversely affect the Company’s results of
operations. From time to time, the Company has received, and may again receive,
letters from third parties drawing the Company’s attention to their patent
rights. While the Company does not believe that it infringes any such rights
that have been brought to the Company’s attention, there may be other more
pertinent proprietary rights of which the Company is presently unaware.


Note 8.   Credit
Facilities

In December 2005, the Company renegotiated and
amended its existing revolving line of credit to increase the available
borrowings under the then existing revolving line of credit to $20 million. Included
in the revolving line of credit is a letter of credit facility of up to $5
million, a foreign exchange facility of up to $5 million and an equipment
facility of up to $10 million. The Company may elect interest rates on our
borrowing calculated by reference to bank’s prime rate less one-half of one
percent or LIBOR plus two percent. The credit facility matures on December 16,
2007, at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid. The credit
facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others,
financial covenants requiring a minimum quick ratio and minimum tangible net
worth, and covenants limiting our ability to dispose of assets, make
acquisitions, be acquired, incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments,
pay dividends and repurchase stock. In December 2006, the Company amended
its credit agreement whereby the only financial covenant for the fourth quarter
of 2006 was a certain minimum cash balance. As of December 31, 2006, the
Company is in compliance with the financial covenants of this credit facility.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company borrowed
$15.0 million against this credit facility and made a $20.0 million one-time
payment to OrthoClear Holdings, Inc in accordance with the terms of the
OrthoClear Agreement. The Company elected LIBOR plus two percent as its
interest rate of 7.29% as of December 31, 2006. The Company repaid $3.5
million of this borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2006, therefore the
outstanding balance as of December 31, 2006 was $11.5 million.

On March 7, 2007, the
Company renegotiated and amended its existing credit facility with Comerica
Bank. The amendment, among other things, will reduce financial covenants to
require only a quick ratio covenant. Additionally, the amendment will also
increase the available borrowings under the existing revolving line of credit
from $20 million to $25 million effective January 1, 2008. The amended
credit facility matures on December 31, 2008 at which point all
outstanding borrowing under this credit facility must be repaid.

Note  9.   Commitments and Contingencies

Operating leases

Align rents its facilities and certain equipment and
automobiles under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements. Facility leases
expire at various dates through 2014 and provide for pre-negotiated fixed rental
rates during the terms of the lease.

In February 2005, the Company renewed its Santa
Clara headquarters lease allowing it to utilize the security deposit of $1.3
million paid at the inception of the lease on July 1, 2000, to reduce the
monthly rent payment by $11,000. By the end of the lease term at June 30,
2010, the security deposit balance will reduce to $0.6 million.

In June 2004, the Company’s European headquarters
signed a lease agreement for a facility in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This
lease expires in 2014 with an option to cancel in 2009 with a lease termination
fee of approximately $238,000. The Company anticipates it will cancel this
lease in 2009 and is accruing for the termination fee on a straight line basis.

The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease period, and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not
paid. Total rent expense was $3.8 million, $4.3 million and, $4.9 million for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Stockholders’
Equity

Preferred Stock

As of December 31,
2006, the Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001
par value, none of which was issued and outstanding. Pursuant to the
Certificate of Designation of Rights and Privileges of Series A
Participating Preferred Stock filed on October 26, 2005,
200,000 shares of such preferred stock have been designated as Series A
Participating Preferred Stock.

Preferred Stock
Rights Agreement

On October 25, 2005,
pursuant to a Preferred Stock Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) between
the Company and EquiServe Trust Company (now Computershare Limited), as the
Rights Agent, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right
(a “Right”) to purchase one one-thousandth share of the Company’s Series A
Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) for each outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of the Company. The dividend
was paid on November 22, 2005 to stockholders of record as of the close of
business on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder, subject to
the terms of the Rights Agreement, to purchase from the Company one
one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred at an exercise price of
$37.00, subject to adjustment. The Rights will be separate from the shares of
Common Stock. Rights Certificates will be issued and the Rights will become
exercisable upon the earlier of (a) the tenth business day (or such later
date as may be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors) after a public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (“Acquiring
Person”) has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the shares of
Common Stock then outstanding, or (b) the tenth business day (or such
later date as may be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors) after a
person or group announces a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which
would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the Company’s
then outstanding shares of Common Stock. An Acquiring Person does not include
certain persons specified in the Rights Agreement. The Rights will expire on
the earliest of (i) November 22, 2015, or (ii) redemption or
exchange of the Rights as described below. As of December 31, 2006, no
rights were exercised.

Common Stock

The holders of common
stock are entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available
and when and if declared by the Board of Directors. The Company has not
declared or paid any dividends as of December 31, 2006.


Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

Align’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase
Plan”) consists of overlapping twenty-four month offering periods with four
six-month purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares
at 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at either the beginning of
the purchase period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is
lower. The Purchase Plan provides that the number of shares of the Company’s
common stock reserved for issuance thereunder will automatically increase on
the first trading day of January in each calendar year by an amount equal
to three percent (3%) of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding
on the last trading day in December of the immediately preceding calendar
year, with this annual increase not to exceed 1,500,000 shares.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, 462,404
shares were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2006, the
Company had reserved 8,933,456 shares of common stock for future issuance and
7,272,388 shares remain available for future issuance.

As of December 31,
2006, there was $0.5 million of total unamortized compensation costs related to
employee stock purchases. These costs are expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of 0.3 years.

Stock Option Plans

In May 2005, stockholder approval was obtained
for the 2005 Incentive Plan (“2005 Plan”), which replaced the 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan (the “2001 Plan”). The 2005 Plan, which expires December 31,
2010, provides for the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock
options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units
and performance shares. Employees, non-employee directors and consultants are
eligible to receive grants under the 2005 Plan. The options are granted for
periods not exceeding ten years and generally vest over 4 years with 25%
vesting one year from the date of grant and 1/48

th

each month thereafter. The Plan Administrator
may, however, grant options with different vesting schedules at its option. In
the first quarter of 2005, the Company granted options under the 2001 Plan
(prior to the approval of the 2005 Plan), that vest over 3 years, with 25%
vested at the date of grant, and 1/36

th

each month thereafter. Options are to be
granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the
underlying shares at the date of grant.

Starting in the first quarter of 2006, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the grant of
restricted stock units (contracts that give the recipients the right to receive
shares as the units vest) to its employees and director(s) in addition to
stock options. Each restricted stock unit award generally vests over 4 years
with 25% on the one year anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting
quarterly thereafter. Any grants of restricted stock units will reduce shares
available for grant at a 2:1 ratio.

The 2005 Plan has
9,983,379 shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance, plus up
to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares that are or would have been returned to the
2001 Plan as a result of termination of outstanding options or repurchase of
shares granted under the 2001 Plan on or after March 28, 2005. As of December 31,
2006, 2,084,687 shares have been transferred to the 2005 Plan. As of December 31,
2006, 7,904,506 shares remain available for issuance under the 2005 Plan.

Executive Grants

In January 2001, the stockholders approved two
option grants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an
exercise price of $15.00 per share to each of the Company’s then Chief
Executive Officer and President. The options were granted outside of the 1997
Equity Incentive Plan and prior to the adoption of the 2001 Plan or the 2005
Plan. The remaining 500,000 shares were cancelled in May 2006. As of December 31,
2006, no options to purchase shares of common stock remained outstanding under
these grants.

their options on December 31, 2006. This amount changes based on the fair
market value of Align’s stock.

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $13.2 million, and $ 3.3

total unamortized compensation costs related to stock options. These costs are
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years. For the
year ended December 31, 2006, total recognized tax benefit from exercised
options was immaterial.

Restricted Stock
Units

Starting
in the first quarter of 2006, the Company began granting restricted stock units
that generally vest over 4 years with 25% vesting on the one year anniversary
of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. The fair value of
each award is based on the Company’s closing stock price on the date of grant.
As of December 31, 2006, the total fair value of vested restricted stock
awards was zero. A summary of the nonvested shares for the year ended December 31,

Stock-based compensation

Effective January 1,
2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(Revised 2004), “Share-based Payment” (“FAS 123R”) using the modified
prospective transition method, which requires the measurement and recognition
of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our
employees and directors and employee stock purchases related to the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan based on estimated fair values over the requisite service
period. In accordance with the modified prospective method, our financial
statements for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not
include the impact of FAS 123R Stock Options.

The expected term of stock options represents the
weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. Upon
the adoption of FAS 123R, the Company used a midpoint model to determine the
expected term of stock options based on the Company’s historical exercise
and  post vesting cancellation
experience, and the remaining contractual life of its outstanding options.

The increase in expected life assumption used in the
Black-Scholes option pricing for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2005, is the result of granting options
with shorter vesting in 2005.

The Company used a combination of historical
volatility and peer group volatility in deriving its expected volatility
assumption as allowed under FAS 123R and SAB 107. The Company’s historical
volatility from 2002 to 2006 was used in determining expected volatility. The
Company used peer group volatility instead of its own historical data for 2001,
as the Company had unusually high volatility in its stock price as the result
of its Initial Public Offering in 2001. The peer group volatility was derived
based on historical volatility of a comparable peer group consisting of
companies of similar size and operating in a similar industry.

The risk free interest rate is based on the implied
yield on a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the
expected term of the option.

The dividend yield
reflects that the Company has not paid any cash dividends since inception and does
not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Summary of
Stock-based Compensation Expense

Stock-based
compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
for the year ended December 31, 2006 is based on awards ultimately
expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. FAS 123R
requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. In the
Company’s pro forma information required under FAS 123 for periods prior to
fiscal 2006, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. The
following


table summarizes stock-based compensation expense
related to all of the Company’s stock-based awards and employee stock purchases
under FAS 123R for the year ended December 31, 2006:

In connection with the grant of stock options prior to
Align’s initial public offering (“IPO”) in 2001 and certain grants subsequent
to the IPO, the Company recorded deferred stock compensation and amortized
stock-based compensation expense over the option vesting period of four years
using the straight-line method. The Company had fully amortized the deferred
stock-based compensation balance as of December 31, 2004. Align recorded
$5.1 million in amortization of deferred stock-based compensation during
fiscal 2004. If the employee terminated employment, which resulted in the
cancellation of any unvested options, the Company reversed the unamortized
deferred stock-based compensation related to those options. Align reversed $0.1
million of unrecognized deferred compensation for terminated employees during
fiscal 2004.

For options granted to non-employees, the Company
recorded stock-based compensation expense of $45,000 and $0.4 million for the
fiscal years of 2005 and 2004, respectively.

During fiscal 2005 and 2004, the Company accelerated
the vesting of options to several employees in connection with related severance
packages. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44 “Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation” (“FIN 44”), the acceleration
charges were measured based on the intrinsic value method, which is the
difference between the market value of common stock at the acceleration date
and the exercise price of the option. Acceleration charges for December 31,
2005 and 2004 were $67,000 and $0.4 million, respectively.

Option Acceleration

On October 6, 2005,
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the acceleration
of the vesting for all unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than
$7.10. The fair market value of Align’s common stock on the date of
acceleration was $6.41 as quoted on the NASDAQ National Market. Options held by
non-employee directors were excluded from the vesting acceleration. As a result
of the acceleration, approximately 3.8 million options or 35% of the then total
outstanding options became immediately exercisable as of October 6, 2005.
The purpose of the acceleration was to eliminate


future
compensation expense the Company would otherwise recognize in its statement of
operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of FAS
123R.

Pro Forma
Information Under FAS 123 for Periods Prior to Fiscal 2006

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted
for stock-based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees” (“APB 25”) and related interpretations and complied with the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.”  Under the intrinsic method, the difference
between the market price on the date of grant and the exercise price is charged
to the results of operations over the vesting period. Accordingly, the Company
was not required to recognize compensation cost for stock options issued to its
employees or shares issued under the Purchase Plan because options were issued
at market price on the date of grant.

FAS
123R requires the Company to present pro forma information for the comparative
period prior to the adoption as if it had accounted for all of its stock
options under the fair value method of FAS 123. The following table illustrates
the pro forma information regarding the effect on net earnings and net earnings
per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 as if the Company
had accounted for the stock-based employee compensation under the fair value
method of accounting:

Note 11.   Employee
Benefit Plan

In January 1999, the
Company adopted a defined contribution retirement plan under Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers substantially all employees who
meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a
portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Company
contributions to the plan may be made at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. There have been no contributions by the Company since the inception
of the plan.

The Company has provided a full valuation allowance at

are unlikely to be realized.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $214.9 million for federal
purposes and $73.5 million for California state tax purposes. If not utilized,
these carryforwards will begin to expire beginning in 2017 for federal purposes
and 2007 for California purposes.

The Company has research credit carryforwards of
approximately $4.0 million for federal purposes and $5.4 million for California
state tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal credit carryforwards will

Basic net profit (loss) per share is computed using
the weighted average number of shares of common stock during the year less
unvested common shares subject to repurchase. Diluted net profit per share is
computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, adjusted
for the dilutive effect of potential common stock. Potential common stock,
computed using the treasury stock method, includes options and unvested shares
subject to repurchase

On March 7, 2007, the Company renegotiated and
amended its existing credit facility with Comerica Bank. The amendment, among
other things, reduced financial covenants to require only a quick ratio
covenant. Additionally, the amendment also increased the available borrowings
under the existing revolving line of credit from $20 million to $25 million
effective January 1, 2008. The amended credit facility matures on December 31,
2008 at which point all outstanding borrowing under this credit facility must
be repaid.

OTHER
INFORMATION

Amendment to Credit
Agreement

On March 7,
2007, we entered into an Amendment to Credit Agreement with Comerica Bank (the “Credit
Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of
December 16, 2005, as amended (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit
Amendment amends the Credit Facility to:

·

extend
the maturity date of the Credit Facility from December 16, 2007 to December 31,
2008;

·

automatically
increase the aggregate principal amount of the Credit Facility from $20 million
to $25 million on January 1, 2008;

·

change
the financial statement reports from a monthly obligation to quarterly;

·

amend
the financial covenants to delete all financial covenants other that the quick
ratio and amending such ratio from 1.75 to 1.00 (excluding deferred revenue) to
1.25 to 1.00 (excluding deferred revenue);

·

include
in the definition of “permitted transfers” transfers related to the Costa Rica
tax restructuring;


·

amend
the definition of “permitted indebtedness” by increasing the amount of
permitted indebtedness of a subsidiary to the Company from 5% to 10% and
including a carve out for Costa Rica tax restructuring; and

·

raise
the cross-default amount from $2 million to $5 million.

A copy of the Amendment is
attached hereto as Exhibit 10.8A.

Amendment to Form
of RSU Agreement

On March 8, 2007, Align and Thomas M. Prescott entered
into an amendment to each of the award agreements evidencing grants of
restricted stock units awarded to Mr. Prescott on February 24, 2006 and February 20, 2007. The amendment
served to make restricted stock unit acceleration terms in the original restrict
stock unit awards consistent with the option acceleration terms included in Mr. Prescott’s
amended and restated employment agreement dated as of April 19, 2005.
Specifically, the amendment deletes the term that accelerated the vesting of
the restricted stock units upon termination of Mr. Prescott’s employment for
cause or good reason and amends the term related to acceleration of vesting
upon a change of control to provide that all of Mr. Prescott’s restricted
stock units will immediately vest upon the occurrence of such an event. The
form of amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.14D and should be
reviewed for additional information.

Our Compensation Committee also adopted a form of
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.14C to
be used in connection with any future grants of restricted stock units awarded
to Mr. Prescott.

Amendment to 2005
Incentive Plan

On March 7,
2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Align Technology, Inc.
2005 Incentive Plan (the “Plan Amendment”). The Plan Amendment amends Section 15
of the 2005 Incentive Plan by:

·

reducing  the number of options to purchase shares of
common stock granted to a new outside director on the date such person first
becomes a member of the Board from 75,000 shares to 30,000 shares;

·

increasing
the annual equity awards automatically granted to each continuing director
(other than the Chairman of the Board) on the date of each annual meeting of
our stockholders from an option to purchase 8,000 shares to (A) an option
to purchase 10,000 shares

plus

(B) a
grant of 3,000 restricted stock units (the “Second Awards”); and

·

clarifying
that the Second Awards shall vest on the earlier of (i) the one year
anniversary of the date of grant and (ii) the date of the next annual
meeting of the Company’s stockholders following the date of grant; and

A copy of the Plan
Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.14.

This number reflects
securities available for future issuance under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan
and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In January 2001, all outstanding
options under the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan were subsumed under the 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan. Since that date no options have been granted under the 1997
Equity Incentive Plan. In May 2005, stockholder approval was obtained for
the 2005 Incentive Plan and the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan was terminated. Since
that date, no further options have been granted under the 2001 Stock Incentive
Plan. The 2005 Incentive Plan has 9,983,379 shares of common stock reserved for
issuance, plus up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares that are or would have
been returned to the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan as a result of termination of
outstanding options or repurchase of shares granted under the 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan after March 28, 2005. As of December 31, 2006
2,084,687 shares have been transferred to the 2005 Incentive Plan. As of December 31,
2006, the number of shares available for future issuance under the 2005
Incentive Plan was 7,904,504. Any grants of restricted stock units will reduce
shares available for grant at a 2:1 ratio. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan
provides that the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance
thereunder will automatically increase on the first trading day of January in
each calendar year by an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the total number
of shares of common stock outstanding on the last trading day in December of
the immediately preceding calendar year, with this annual increase not to
exceed 1,500,000 shares. As of December 31, 2006, the total number of
shares of our common stock available for future issuance under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan was 7,272,388.
