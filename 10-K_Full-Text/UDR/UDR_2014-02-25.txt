EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2013

of UDR, Inc. a Maryland corporation, and United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, of which UDR is the parent company and sole general partner. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company”, “UDR” or “UDR, Inc.” refer collectively to UDR, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, including the Operating Partnership. Unless the context otherwise requires, the references in this Report to the “Operating Partnership” or the “OP” refer to United Dominion Realty, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. “Common stock” refers to the common stock of UDR and “stockholders” means the holders of shares of UDR’s common stock and preferred stock.

This combined Form 10-K is being filed separately by UDR and the Operating Partnership.

There are a number of differences between our company and our operating partnership, which are reflected in our disclosure in this report. UDR is a real estate investment trust (a “REIT”), whose most significant asset is its ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. UDR also conducts business through other subsidiaries, including its taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), RE


, whose activities include development of land and land entitlement. UDR acts as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, holds interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures, owns and operates properties, issues securities from time to time and guarantees debt of certain of our subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of a substantial portion of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity securities. The Operating Partnership has guaranteed certain outstanding securities of UDR.

As of

December 31, 2013

, UDR owned

110,883

units (100%) of the general partnership interests of the Operating Partnership and

173,848,891

units (or approximately

94.9%

)

of the limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. UDR conducts a substantial amount of its business and holds a substantial amount of its assets through the Operating Partnership, and, by virtue of its ownership of the OP Units and being the Operating Partnership’s sole general partner, UDR has the ability to control all of the day-to-day operations of the Operating Partnership. Separate financial statements and accompanying notes, as well as separate discussions under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchasers of Equity Securities” and “Control and Procedures” are provided for each of UDR and the Operating Partnership.

Item 1. BUSINESS

General

UDR is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the United States. The high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. At

December 31, 2013

, our consolidated real estate portfolio included


communities located in


markets, with a total of

41,250

completed apartment homes, which are held through our subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we have an ownership interest in


communities containing

9,909

apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships. At

December 31, 2013

, the Company is developing

six

wholly-owned communities with

1,765

apartment homes,


of which have been completed, and one unconsolidated joint venture community with 447 apartment homes, none of which have been completed.

At

December 31, 2013

, the Operating Partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio included


communities located in


markets, with a total of

20,746

completed apartment homes. The Operating Partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the United States. During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, revenues of the Operating Partnership represented approximately

54%

of our total rental revenues.

UDR elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as the “Code”. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. In


, we declared total distributions of

$0.94

per common share and paid dividends of

$0.925

per common share.


UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. The Operating Partnership is the successor-in-interest to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. The Operating Partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a Delaware limited partnership. Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. Our website is located at

www.udr.com

.

As of

February 18, 2014

, we had 1,593 full-time associates and 88 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by UDR.

Reporting Segments

We report in two segments:

Same-Store Communities

and

Non-Mature Communities/Other

.

Our S

ame-Store Communities

segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2012

, and held as of

December 31, 2013

. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for sale at year end. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.

Our

Non-Mature Communities/Other

segment includes those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011,


or


, sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as real estate held for sale, consolidated joint venture properties, properties managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our operating segments, see Note 15,

Reportable Segments

, in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report and Note 12,

Reportable Segments

, in the Notes to the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Business Objectives

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:

•

own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders;

•

manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities;

•

empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively;

•

measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and

•

manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of earnings and dividends.


Highlights

•

In July 2013, the Company marked its 41st year as a REIT and paid its 164th consecutive quarterly dividend in October. The Company’s annualized declared 2013 dividend of $0.94 represented a 7% increase over the previous year.

•

We achieved Same-Store revenue growth of 4.9% and Same-Store net operating income (“NOI”) growth of 6.0%.


•

During the year ended December, 31, 2013, we invested approximately $279.6 million in wholly-owned development projects and $92.1 million in redevelopment projects, including completion of 904 development apartment homes and 837 redevelopment apartment homes in targeted core markets.

•

We expanded our relationship with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”):

•

Formed five 50%/50% partnerships in our Vitruvian Park® master plan development project consisting of three operating communities and approximately 28 acres of developable land in Addison, Texas. In connection with the formation of the five partnerships, we sold 50% of our interests in the three operating communities and the developable land to MetLife for approximately $141.3 million.

•

Expanded the UDR/MetLife II joint venture by increasing our ownership interests in two A-quality, high-rise communities located in Denver, Colorado and San Diego, California in exchange for our ownership interests in four non-core UDR/MetLife I joint venture communities plus an additional $15.6 million in cash.

•

Formed a 51%/49% joint venture with MetLife to develop a $318 million, 447-home high-rise located in the Rincon Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. In connection with the formation, we sold 49% of our interest to MetLife for approximately $29.9 million.

•

We issued $300 million of 3.70%, 7-year senior unsecured medium-term notes in September. Net proceeds were used to repay indebtedness on our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.

•

We amended and favorably re-priced our $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility and $350 million of unsecured term notes.

•

We sold our 95% interest in a recently developed joint venture community, the Lodge at Stoughton, located in Metro Boston, for $48.5 million, resulting in a gain (before tax) of approximately $8.3 million.

•

We entered into a participating debt financing arrangement with a third party that is developing a $108 million, 218-home, high-rise luxury community located in the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Metro Denver.

Other than the following, there were no significant changes to the Operating Partnership’s business during


(the above


highlights relate to UDR or other subsidiaries of UDR):

•

We exited the Sacramento market through the disposition of two communities for gross proceeds $81.1 million resulting in a gain of approximately $41.5 million.

Our Strategies and Vision

Our vision is to be the innovative multifamily public REIT of choice. Our strategic priorities are:

Capital Allocation

Acquisitions and Dispositions

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•

population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;

•

geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale;

•

construction quality, condition and design of the property;


•

current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;

•

potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•

ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment;

•

whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market;

•

terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;

•

occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity;

•

prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and

•

competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area.

We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include:

•

current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset;

•

potential increases in new construction in the market area;

•

areas with low job growth prospects;

•

markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and

•

operating efficiencies.

Development Activities

Our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. Demographic trends, economic drivers, and how multifamily fundamentals/valuations have trended over the long-term govern our review process on where to allocate development capital. At December 31, 2013, our development pipeline for six wholly-owned communities located in San Francisco, California; Huntington Beach, California; Mission Viejo, California; Boston, Massachusetts; College Park, Maryland; and Alexandria, Virginia totaled 1,765 homes, 422 of which have been completed, with a budget of $697.6 million in which we have a carrying value of $467.4 million.

Redevelopment Activities

Our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. During 2013, we continued to redevelop properties in targeted markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. At December 31, 2013, the Company is redeveloping 1,423 apartment homes, 1,008 of which have been completed, at two wholly-owned communities with 1,670 apartment homes located in New York, New York and Costa Mesa, California. The scope of the redevelopments at both projects changed in the fourth quarter. The budget for our Rivergate project in Manhattan expanded due to the identification of further


revenue generating opportunities, while we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde project in Orange County due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred $112.7 million in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings.

Joint Venture Activities

We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures.  Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (ii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.

The Operating Partnership is not a party to any of the joint venture activities described above.

Balance Sheet Management

We maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. We have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate.

Financing Activities

As part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities.

Operational Excellence, Cash Flow and Dividend Growth

Investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. Since its launch in January 2009, our residents have been utilizing our web-based resident internet portal on our website. Our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In July 2010, we completed the roll out of online leasing renewals throughout our portfolio. As a result of transforming our operations through technology, resident’s satisfaction improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. Web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes.

In 2013, UDR rolled out an online leasing platform that allows prospects to apply directly online.  As of December 31, 2013, over 40% of our leases have been processed using online leasing.  We also focused heavily on conversion optimization of our traffic through UDR.com, which resulted in a 14% increase from the prior year.

Portfolio Improvement

We are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. Portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 69.5% of our same-store net operating income (“NOI”) was generated by communities located in our core markets of: Seattle, Washington; San Francisco Bay Area, California; Los Angeles, California; Orange County, California; San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; New York, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; and Metropolitan D.C.

Operating Partnership Strategies and Vision

The Operating Partnership’s long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology. As a result, the Operating Partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in New York, New York; San Francisco Bay Area,


California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Metropolitan D.C. markets over the past years. Prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth, low single-family home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing, which are three key drivers to strong rental growth.

Markets and Competitive Conditions

During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, 69.5% of our consolidated same-store net operating income (“NOI”) was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets. At

December 31, 2013

, the Company held 74.5% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our core markets. During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, 77.8% of the Operating Partnership’s same-store NOI was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets. At

December 31, 2013

, the Operating Partnership held 81.1% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio in its core markets. We believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings.

Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. Competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:

•

a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise;

•

scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our Internet marketing efforts;

•

access to sources of capital;

•

geographic diversification with a presence in 21 markets across the country; and

•

significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert.

Moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside.

Communities

At

December 31, 2013

, our consolidated real estate portfolio included


communities with a total of

41,250

completed apartment homes, which included the Operating Partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of


communities with a total of

20,746

completed apartment homes. The overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents.

At

December 31, 2013

, the Company is developing

six

wholly-owned communities with

1,765

apartment homes,


of which have been completed. Of these six development communities, the Operating Partnership is developing one wholly-owned community totaling 332 homes, none of which have been completed at

December 31, 2013

. In addition, at December 31, 2013, the Company had two communities with 731 apartment homes which were completed but not yet stabilized.

At

December 31, 2013

, the Company is redeveloping 1,423 apartment homes, 1,008 of which have been completed, at

two

wholly-owned communities with

1,670

apartment homes. The scope of the redevelopments at both projects changed in the fourth quarter. The budget for our Rivergate project in Manhattan expanded due to the identification of further revenue generating opportunities, while we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde project in Orange County due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket. The Operating Partnership owns 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde

.


Same-Store Community Comparison

We believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same-store communities’ NOI, which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses. Our same-store community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year.

For the year ended

December 31, 2013

, our same-store NOI

increased

by

$23.9 million

or

6.0%

compared to the prior year. Our same-store community properties provided 83% of our total NOI for the year ended December 31, 2013. The

increase

in NOI for the

35,790

same-store apartment homes, or 87% of our portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, and increased occupancy, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.

For the year ended

December 31, 2013

, the Operating Partnership’s same-store NOI

increased

by

$13.3 million

or

5.9%

compared to the prior year.  Our same-store community properties provided 84% of our total NOI for the year ended December 31, 2013. The

increase

in NOI for the

18,616

same-store apartment homes, or 90% of the Operating Partnership’s portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, and increased occupancy, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.

Revenue growth in 2014 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.

Tax Matters

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

We may utilize our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), RE


, to engage in activities that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Our TRS generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. However, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the Operating Partnership are incurred at the entity level.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of 14 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

Environmental Matters

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of


the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

There are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the Company and the Operating Partnership. The following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this Report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. Forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law.

Risks Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Our Operations

Unfavorable Apartment Market and Economic Conditions Could Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels, Rental Revenues and the Value of Our Real Estate Assets.

Unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. Our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. Some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments and real estate taxes, generally do not decline when related rents decline. We would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to UDR’s stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. Factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others:

•

downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment;

•

declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable;

•

government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive;

•

local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes;

•

declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;

•

changes in market rental rates;

•

our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms;

•

the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations;

•

declines in household formation; and

•

rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs.

We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Apartment Units as Leases Expire.

When our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. Even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. If residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase.

Continued Economic Weakness Following the Economic Recession that the U.S. Economy Recently Experienced May Materially and Adversely Affect our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The U.S. economy continues to experience


some weakness following a severe recession, including relatively high levels of unemployment and weak consumer spending. In addition, while the Federal Reserve took policy actions to promote market liquidity and encourage economic growth following the recession, such actions are now being curtailed as signs of improvement in the economy have emerged, and the impact of these monetary policy actions on the economy is uncertain. If the economic recovery slows or stalls, or if the economy experiences another recession, we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. We are also exposed to risks relating to the housing market recovery that has accompanied the economic recovery, to the extent that when demand for single family homes increases, demand for apartments may decline, which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.

Substantial International, National and Local Government Spending and Increasing Deficits May Adversely Impact Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The values of, and the cash flows from, the properties we own are affected by developments in global, national and local economies. As a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions, federal, state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities. These increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending, tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events, which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risk of Inflation/Deflation.

Substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. The general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate higher than our rental rates. The predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction. Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties.

We Are Subject to Certain Risks Associated with Selling Apartment Communities, Which Could Limit Our Operational and Financial Flexibility.

We periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. Furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. These conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. We are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities:

•

a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the “Code,” so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and

•

federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.

Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease Apartment Homes or Increase or Maintain Rents.

Our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single-and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of Past or Future Acquisitions, and the Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel Successfully Could Create Inefficiencies.

We have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;

•

even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition;


•

even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs;

•

we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete;

•

when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability;

•

the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and

•

we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability.

Competition Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Acquire Properties.

In the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns.

Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our Profitability.

In the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. Development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. Our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks:

•

we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments;

•

we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations;

•

yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected;

•

if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited;

•

we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;

•

we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs;

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and

•

when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance.

In some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. We may experience similar cost increases in the future. Our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Bankruptcy or Defaults of Our Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Our Performance.

We have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. As a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result


in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Property Ownership Through Joint Ventures May Limit Our Ability to Act Exclusively in Our Interest.

We have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. We currently have 10 active joint ventures and partnerships, excluding our participating loan investment, with a total equity investment of $493.4 million. We could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. Moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. In some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. Also, our joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. Frequently, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners’ interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner’s interest in the joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process.

We are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our joint venture partner, including (i) a deadlock if we and our joint venture partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the joint venture without the consent of the other joint venture partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture.

We Could Incur Significant Insurance Costs and Some Potential Losses May Not Be Adequately Covered by Insurance.

We have a comprehensive insurance program with limits of liability customary within the multi-family industry covering our property and operating activities. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. In addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage.

If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. Material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. If one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to UDR’s stockholders.

As a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. Insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which are generally outside of our control. We insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. The financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted resulting in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. Their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. In addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our Growth.

We have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. Entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. These risks include, among others:

•

inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies;

•

inability to hire and retain key personnel;

•

lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and

•

inability to achieve budgeted financial results.

Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could Result in Substantial Costs.

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and


remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. In addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property.

In addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. Noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. Changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations.

As the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. For example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or ACM. Environmental, health and safety laws require that ACM be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements.

These requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if ACM would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. In addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to ACM or releases of ACM into the environment.

We cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our Properties May Contain or Develop Harmful Mold or Suffer from Other Indoor Air Quality Issues, Which Could Lead to Liability for Adverse Health Effects or Property Damage or Cost for Remediation.

When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.

Compliance or Failure to Comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or Other Safety Regulations and Requirements Could Result in Substantial Costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. From time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this Act. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.

Real Estate Tax and Other Laws.

Generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. These costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing


Amendments Act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders.

Risk of Damage from Catastrophic Weather and Natural Events and Potential Climate Change.

Certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. These adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations.

To the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas. Should the impact of such climate change be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Risk of Earthquake Damage.

Some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. As a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical.

Risk of Accidental Death Due to Fire, Natural Disasters or Other Hazards.

The accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Actual or Threatened Terrorist Attacks May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business and Operating Results and Could Decrease the Value of Our Assets.

Actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. Further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. In addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Mezzanine Loan Assets Involve Greater Risks of Loss than Senior Loans Secured by Income-producing Properties.

We may acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. Mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. In the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. As a result, we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal.

We May Experience a Decline in the Fair Value of Our Assets and Be Forced to Recognize Impairment Charges, Which Could Materially and Adversely Impact Our Financial Condition, Liquidity and Results of Operations and the Market Price of UDR

’

s Common Stock.

A decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under GAAP if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized


cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. If we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of UDR’s common stock.

Any Material Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on UDR

’

s Stock Price.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on UDR’s stock price.

Our Business and Operations Would Suffer in the Event of System Failures or Breaches in Data Security.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and keeping of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.

Our Success Depends on Our Senior Management.

Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. We may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We May be Adversely Affected by New Federal Laws and Regulations.

The United States Administration and Congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to health care, financial regulation reform, climate change, executive compensation and others. We believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. At this time, we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us.

Federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the recent economic downturn. These initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the United States at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the Great Depression. The federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on July 21, 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. The Dodd-Frank Act, including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the United States Congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable.

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. Because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. We intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and


administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.

We May be Adversely Affected by New State and Local Laws and Regulations.

We are subject to state and local laws, regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. We cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of new legislation might have on our business.

Derivatives Legislation Adopted by Congress Could Have an Adverse Impact on our Ability to Hedge Risks Associated with our Business.

The Dodd-Frank Act regulates derivative transactions, which include certain instruments used in our risk management activities. The Dodd-Frank Act contemplates that most swaps will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility. There are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk and REITs meeting certain criteria. While we may ultimately be eligible for such exceptions, we cannot ensure we will qualify for them. Although the Dodd-Frank Act includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives, the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until regulations have been adopted and fully implemented by both the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and market participants establish and operate registered clearing facilities under those regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act provisions regarding derivatives and the implementing regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available hedge counterparties to us.

Changes in the System for Establishing U.S. Accounting Standards May Materially and Adversely Affect Our Reported Results of Operations.

Accounting for public companies in the United States has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP is established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the SEC as authoritative for publicly held companies. The International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”) is a London-based independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). IFRS generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in Europe and in developed nations around the world.

IFRS differs in material respects from GAAP. Among other things, IFRS has historically relied more on “fair value” models of accounting for assets and liabilities than GAAP. “Fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities, often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to GAAP, which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation.

We are monitoring the SEC’s activity with respect to the proposed adoption of IFRS by United States public companies. It is unclear at this time how the SEC will propose that GAAP and IFRS be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted. In addition, switching to a new method of accounting and adopting IFRS would be a complex undertaking. We would potentially need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of IFRS. Since these are new endeavors, and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately to be adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain.

We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of IFRS on our financial position and results of operations. Such evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity regarding the specific IFRS standards that would potentially be adopted. Until there is more certainty with respect to the IFRS standards that could be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our conversion to IFRS could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financings

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and Create Refinancing Risk.

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy UDR’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. We are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. In addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to UDR’s stockholders.


Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt Service Payments and Distributions to Stockholders.

If our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to UDR’s stockholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities:

•

the national and local economies;

•

local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes;

•

tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located;

•

our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance;

•

rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities;

•

competition from other apartment communities;

•

changes in interest rates and the availability of financing;

•

changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and

•

changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing.

Expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.

Our Debt Level May Be Increased.

Our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.

Financing May Not Be Available and Could Be Dilutive.

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. We and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. If we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted.

Failure To Maintain Our Current Credit Ratings Could Adversely Affect Our Cost of Funds, Related Margins, Liquidity, and Access to Capital Markets.

Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Due to changes in market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets.

Disruptions in Financial Markets May Adversely Impact Availability and Cost of Credit and Have Other Adverse Effects on Us and the Market Price of UDR

’

s Stock.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. During the past several years, the United States stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing. The potential downgrade of the U.S.’s credit rating and the European debt crisis recently contributed to instability in global credit markets. Continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our business. Additionally, due to this uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. If we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties


on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. A prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. These events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of UDR’s common or preferred stock. The disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of UDR’s common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business.

Prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels. Tightening of credit in financial markets and high unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis. Disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy.

A Change in U.S. Government Policy Regarding Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Business.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate. We and other multifamily companies depend heavily on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans. In September 2008, the U.S. government assumed control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the U.S. that could involve the phase out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While we believe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets. Uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.

The Soundness of Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us.

We have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. In the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Changing Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow and the Market Price of Our Securities.

We currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2013, UDR had approximately

$404.7

million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 11.5% of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. As of December 31, 2013, the Operating Partnership had approximately

$169.1 million

of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately

18.1%

of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. An increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. The effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. In addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of UDR’s common and preferred stock and debt securities.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May Result in Material Charges.

From time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. If the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. In addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.


Risks Related to Tax Laws

We Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if UDR Failed to Qualify as a REIT.

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. Our qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. In addition, U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or adversely affect UDR’s stockholders.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to UDR’s stockholders in computing our taxable income. Also, unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a REIT. The additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to UDR’s stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to UDR’s stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

Dividends Paid By REITs Generally Do Not Qualify for Reduced Tax Rates.

In general, the maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual U.S. shareholders is 20%. Unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a REIT, our distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates.

UDR May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable REIT Subsidiaries, Which are Subject to Certain Tax Risks.

We have established several taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite UDR’s qualification as a REIT, its taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. In addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. While we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not adversely affect our REIT qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable REIT subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected.

REIT Distribution Requirements Limit Our Available Cash.

As a REIT, UDR is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to UDR’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code. However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code.

Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain Attributable to the Transaction.

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. If the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect UDR’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

We Could Face Possible State and Local Tax Audits and Adverse Changes in State and Local Tax Laws.

As discussed in the risk factors above, because UDR is organized and qualifies as a REIT it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but


it is subject to certain state and local taxes. From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to UDR’s stockholders. In the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. If such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

The Operating Partnership Intends to Qualify as a Partnership, But Cannot Guarantee That It Will Qualify.

The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the Operating Partnership admits additional limited partners other than UDR. If classified as a partnership, the Operating Partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability. However, the Operating Partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a “publicly traded partnership,” unless at least 90% of the Operating Partnership’s income was qualifying income as defined in the Code. A “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). Although the Operating Partnership’s partnership units are not traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption right, the Operating Partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the Operating Partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations. Qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. The income requirements applicable to REITs and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. The Operating Partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. If the Operating Partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax liabilities, and UDR would then fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired.

Qualifying as a REIT Involves Highly Technical and Complex Provisions of the Code.

Our qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the REIT income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. In addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Ownership of UDR’s Stock

Changes in Market Conditions and Volatility of Stock Prices Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of UDR

’

s Common Stock.

The stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), on which we list UDR’s common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of UDR’s common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in UDR’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition to the risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of UDR’s common stock, including:

•

general market and economic conditions;

•

actual or anticipated variations in UDR’s quarterly operating results or dividends or UDR’s payment of dividends in shares of UDR’s stock;

•

changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•

difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt;

•

decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations;

•

changes in market valuations of similar companies;

•

publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;


•

the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies);

•

general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of UDR’s stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;

•

a change in analyst ratings;

•

additions or departures of key management personnel;

•

adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;

•

speculation in the press or investment community;

•

terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which UDR’s securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending;

•

failure to qualify as a REIT;

•

strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;

•

failure to satisfy listing requirements of the NYSE;

•

governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and

•

the issuance of additional shares of UDR’s common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under UDR’s at-the-market equity distribution program.

Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of shares of UDR’s common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects.

We May Change the Dividend Policy for UDR

’

s Common Stock in the Future.

The decision to declare and pay dividends on UDR’s common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. Any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of UDR’s common stock.

Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in UDR

’

s Stockholders

’

Best Interests.

Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to various Maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our Company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in UDR’s stockholders’ best interests. The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of UDR’s stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote.

Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability of UDR

’

s Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company Restricts the Transferability of UDR

’

s Stock and May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to UDR

’

s Stockholders.

One of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the Code, during the last half of any taxable year. Our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to UDR’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other REIT ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten REIT status. These restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the


person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. Absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of UDR’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the Code for REITs, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. These provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for UDR’s stockholders or might otherwise be in UDR’s stockholders’ best interests.

PART II

Item 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

UDR, Inc.:

Common Stock

UDR, Inc.’s common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or “NYSE”, under the symbol “UDR” since May 7, 1990. The following tables set forth the quarterly high and low sale prices per common share reported on the NYSE for each quarter of the last two fiscal years. Distribution information for common stock reflects distributions declared per share for each calendar quarter and paid at the end of the following month.

On

February 18, 2014

, the closing sale price of our common stock was

$25.94

per share on the NYSE, and there were

4,581

holders of record of the

251,434,518

outstanding shares of our common stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax purposes, approximately 81% of the distributions for


represented ordinary income, 12% represented long-term capital gain, and 7% represented unrecaptured section 1250 gain.

UDR pays regular quarterly distributions to holders of its common stock. Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our actual funds from operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, and other factors.

Series E Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series E”) has no stated par value and a liquidation preference of

$16.61

per share. Subject to certain adjustments and conditions, each share of the Series E is convertible at any time and from time to time at the holder’s option into

1.083

shares of our common stock. The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for the election of directors or for any other purpose on which the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or any mandatory redemption. In connection with a special dividend (declared on November 5, 2008), the Company reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Series E additional shares of common stock to which a holder of the Series E would have received if the holder had converted the Series E immediately prior to the record date for this special dividend.

Distributions declared on the Series E for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and December 31, 2012 were

$1.33

per share or $0.3322 per quarter. The Series E is not listed on any exchange. At

December 31, 2013

, a total of

2,803,812

shares of the Series E were outstanding.

Series F Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue up to

20,000,000

shares of our Series F Preferred Stock (“Series F”). The Series F may be purchased by holders of our Operating Partnership Units, or OP Units, described below under “Operating Partnership Units,” at a purchase price of

$0.0001

per share. OP Unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and purchase one share of the Series F for each OP Unit held. At

December 31, 2013

, a total of

2,464,183

shares of the Series F were outstanding with an aggregate purchase value of

$246

. Holders of the Series F are entitled to one vote for each share of the Series F they hold, voting together with the holders of our common stock, on each matter submitted to a vote of security holders at a meeting of our stockholders. The Series F does not entitle its holders to any other rights, privileges or preferences.


Series G Preferred Stock

In May 2007, UDR issued

5,400,000

shares of the

6.75%

Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series G”).  On May 31, 2012, the Company completed the redemption of all outstanding shares of its Series G.  A total of

3,264,362

shares of Series G were redeemed at a redemption price of

$25

per share in cash, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date for a total cost of

$82.1 million

. As a result of this redemption, the write off of additional paid in capital of

$2.8 million

related to the issuance of Series G was recognized as a decrease to our net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders. During the year ended 2011, the Company repurchased

141,200

shares of Series G for more than the liquidation preference of

$25

per share, resulting in a loss of

$175,000

to our net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders.

Distributions declared on the Series G for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $0.57.

Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under which holders of our common stock may elect to automatically reinvest their distributions and make additional cash payments to acquire additional shares of our common stock. Stockholders who do not participate in the plan continue to receive distributions as and when declared. As of February 18, 2014, there were approximately 2,412 participants in the plan.

United Dominion Realty, L.P.:

Operating Partnership Units

There is no established public trading market for United Dominion Realty, L.P.’s Operating Partnership Units. From time to time we issue shares of our common stock in exchange for OP Units tendered to the Operating Partnership for redemption in accordance with the provisions of the Operating Partnership’s limited partnership agreement. At

December 31, 2013

, there were

183,278,698

OP Units outstanding in the Operating Partnership, of which

173,959,774

OP Units or

94.9%

were owned by UDR and

9,318,924

OP Units or

5.1%

were owned by limited partners. Under the terms of the Operating Partnership’s limited partnership agreement, the holders of OP Units have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the holder in exchange for a cash payment based on the market value of our common stock at the time of redemption. However, the Operating Partnership’s obligation to pay the cash amount is subject to the prior right of the Company to acquire such OP Units in exchange for either the cash amount or the number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of OP Units being redeemed. During


, we issued a total of

76,295

shares of common stock upon redemption of OP Units.

On December 13, 2013, we issued 4,450 shares of our common stock upon redemption of OP Units. Because these shares of common stock were issued to accredited investors in transactions not involving a public offering, the transaction is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in accordance with Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

We did not issue any other shares of our common stock upon redemption of OP Units during the three months ended December 31, 2013.

In November 2013, the Operating Partnership distributed the development property, Los Alisos, to the General Partner as a capital distribution. Upon the distribution of the property, the Operating Partnership redeemed 1,002,556 limited partnership units owned by UDR and affiliated entities.

Purchases of Equity Securities

In February 2006, UDR’s Board of Directors authorized a 10,000,000 share repurchase program. In January 2008, UDR’s Board of Directors authorized a new 15,000,000 share repurchase program. Under the two share repurchase programs, UDR may repurchase shares of our common stock in open market purchases, block purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. As reflected in the table below, no shares of common stock were repurchased under these programs during the quarter ended

December 31, 2013

.


(1)

This number reflects the amount of shares that were available for purchase under our 10,000,000 share repurchase program authorized in February 2006 and our 15,000,000 share repurchase program authorized in January 2008.

Comparison of Five-year Cumulative Total Returns

The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total returns for UDR common stock with the comparable cumulative return of the NAREIT Equity REIT Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index, the NAREIT Equity Apartment Index and the MSCI US REIT Index. The graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31 (of the initial year shown in the graph), in each of our common stock and the indices presented. Historical stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. The comparison assumes that all dividends are reinvested.

Item 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following tables set forth selected consolidated financial and other information of UDR, Inc. and of the Operating Partnership as of and for each of the years in the five-year period ended

December 31, 2013

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included elsewhere in this Report.


(a)

Reclassified to conform to current year presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as described in Note 4,

Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale

, in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

(b)

Funds from operations, or FFO, is defined as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP”), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s definition issued in April 2002. We consider FFO a useful metric for investors as we use FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance, and believe that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flows as a measure of our activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs.

Activities of our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), RE


,

include development and land entitlement. From time to time, we develop and subsequently sell a TRS property which results in a short-term use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional long-term investment in real estate for REITs. We believe that the inclusion of these TRS gains in FFO is consistent with the standards established by NAREIT as the short-term investment is incidental to our main business. TRS gains on sales, net of taxes, are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

Forward-Looking Statements

This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning property acquisitions and dispositions, development activity and capital expenditures, capital raising activities, rent growth, occupancy, and rental expense growth. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “likely,” “will,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among other things, unfavorable changes in the apartment


market, changing economic conditions, the impact of inflation/deflation on rental rates and property operating expenses, expectations concerning availability of capital and the stabilization of the capital markets, the impact of competition and competitive pricing, acquisitions, developments and redevelopments not achieving anticipated results, delays in completing developments, redevelopments and lease-ups on schedule, expectations on job growth, home affordability an demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing, expectations concerning development and redevelopment activities, expectations on occupancy levels, expectations concerning the joint ventures with third parties, expectations that automation will help grow net operating income, and expectations on annualized net operating income.

The following factors, among others, could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements:

•

general economic conditions;

•

unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions that could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates;

•

the failure of acquisitions to achieve anticipated results;

•

possible difficulty in selling apartment communities;

•

competitive factors that may limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents;

•

insufficient cash flow that could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk;

•

failure to generate sufficient revenue, which could impair our debt service payments and distributions to stockholders;

•

development and construction risks that may impact our profitability;

•

potential damage from natural disasters, including hurricanes and other weather-related events, which could result in substantial costs to us;

•

risks from extraordinary losses for which we may not have insurance or adequate reserves;

•

uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insurance retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage;

•

delays in completing developments and lease-ups on schedule;

•

our failure to succeed in new markets;

•

changing interest rates, which could increase interest costs and affect the market price of our securities;

•

potential liability for environmental contamination, which could result in substantial costs to us;

•

the imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code in any taxable year;

•

our internal control over financial reporting may not be considered effective which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, and in turn have an adverse effect on our stock price; and

•

changes in real estate laws, tax laws and other laws affecting our business.

A discussion of these and other factors affecting our business and prospects is set forth in Part II, Item 1A.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein and is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


of each of UDR, Inc. and United Domination Realty, L.P.

UDR, INC.:

Business Overview

We are a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities. We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. Our subsidiaries include an operating partnership, United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “UDR” refer collectively to UDR, Inc., its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures.

At

December 31, 2013

, our consolidated real estate portfolio included


communities in 10 States plus the District of Columbia totaling

41,250

apartment homes, and our total real estate portfolio, inclusive of our unconsolidated communities, included an additional


communities with

9,909

apartment homes.

At December 31, 2013, the Company is developing

six

wholly-owned communities with

1,765

apartment homes,


of which have been completed, and one unconsolidated joint venture community with 447 apartment homes, none of which have been completed.

At December 31, 2013, the Company is redeveloping 1,423 apartment homes, 1,008 of which have been completed, at

two

wholly-owned communities with

1,670

apartment homes. The scope of the redevelopments at both projects changed in the fourth quarter. The budget for our Rivergate project in Manhattan expanded due to the identification of further revenue generating opportunities, while we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde project in Orange County due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty. Estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, to the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Cost Capitalization

In conformity with GAAP, we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.

In addition, we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. As each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Company ceases capitalization on the related portion. The costs capitalized are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as

Total Real Estate Owned, Net of Accumulated Depreciation.


Amounts capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 were $40.5 million, $36.4 million, and $23.0 million, respectively.

Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

We may enter into various joint venture agreements and/or partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. We determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement, applying the applicable accounting guidance. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Throughout our financial statements, and in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100% ownership interest.

We continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. The amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. If we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. The aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property. Should the actual results differ from management’s judgment, the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs (defined as Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy) related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

Real Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components, such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases, based on the fair value of each component. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including independent appraisals, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As such, the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease-up period. We determine the fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up period, and the carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. The fair value of in-place leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period.

REIT Status

We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a REIT.  A REIT is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the Code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that a REIT must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to our stockholders. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four years. Based on the net earnings reported for the year ended December 31, 2013 in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, we would have incurred federal and state GAAP income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a REIT.


Summary of Real Estate Portfolio by Geographic Market

The following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

(a)

Monthly Income per Occupied Home represents total monthly revenues divided by the product of occupancy and the number of mature apartment homes.

(b)

The Company is currently developing

six

wholly-owned communities with

1,765

apartment homes,


of which have been completed.

We report in two segments:

Same-Store Communities

and

Non-Mature Communities/Other

.


Our

Same-Store Communities

segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to January 1, 2012 and held as of

December 31, 2013

. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not held for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.

Our

Non-Mature Communities/Other

segment represents those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011, 2012 or 2013, held for sale or sold properties, redevelopment properties, consolidated joint venture properties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows, sales of properties, borrowings under our credit agreements, and/or the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements. We routinely use our unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. During the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the repayment of financing on development activities, and potential property acquisitions, through secured and unsecured borrowings, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and/or the disposition of properties. We believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the Company in accordance with REIT requirements. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations, borrowings under credit agreements, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and dispositions of properties.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or “SEC” which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, warrants, subscription rights, purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets. Access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance.

In April 2012, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement, under which the Company could offer and sell up to 20 million shares of its common stock, from time to time, to or through its sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2013, no shares of common stock were sold under the April 2012 program. As of December 31, 2013, we had 19,929,000 shares of common stock available for sale under the April 2012 program.

Future Capital Needs

Future development and redevelopment expenditures may be funded through unsecured or secured credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities, sales of properties, joint ventures, and, to a lesser extent, from cash flows provided by property operations. Acquisition activity in strategic markets may be funded through joint ventures, by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties, through the issuance of equity or debt securities, the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured and/or unsecured debt.

During


, we have approximately

$48.0 million

of secured debt maturing, inclusive of principal amortization, and

$311.6 million

of unsecured debt maturing. In January 2014, we paid off $184 million of 5.13% medium-term notes due January 2014 with the borrowings under the Company’s $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility. We anticipate repaying the remaining debt with cash flow from our operations, proceeds from debt or equity offerings, proceeds from the dispositions of properties, or from borrowings under our credit agreements.

Statements of Cash Flow

The following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities, and net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended

Acquisitions

In December 2013, the Company consolidated its 95%/5% development joint ventures 13th and Market in San Diego, CA and Domain College Park in Metropolitan, D.C. The consolidation was due to the Company becoming the managing partner of each of the joint ventures. See further discussion in the Note 5,

Joint Ventures and Partnerships,

in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

December 31, 2012, the Company acquired the remaining 80% ownership interests in two apartment communities (633 homes) located in Austin, Texas for $11.7 million from its joint venture partner. In addition, the Company also acquired two parcels of land for development in San Francisco, California and Boston, Massachusetts for a total purchase price of $77.2 million. Refer to the below sections

and

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Partnerships

for further information on development activities.

Capital Expenditures

Total capital expenditures, which in aggregate include recurring capital expenditures and major renovations, of

$145.2 million

or

$3,537

per stabilized home were spent on all of our communities, excluding development and commercial properties, for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

as compared to

$157.3 million

or

$3,576

per stabilized home for the comparable period in prior year.

The decrease in total capital expenditures was primarily due to a decrease in major renovations of 11.6% or $12.1 million. Major renovations of

$92.1 million

or

$2,244

per home were spent for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

as compared to

$104.3 million

or

$2,370

per home for the comparable period in the prior year. Major renovations for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

were primarily attributable to the redevelopment of

two

wholly-owned communities (1,423 of 1,670 apartment homes being redeveloped, 1,008 of which have been completed) with a budget of

$173.3 million

of which we have

$134.3 million

of costs incurred at

December 31, 2013

. The scope of the redevelopments at both projects changed in the fourth quarter. The budget for our Rivergate project in Manhattan expanded due to the identification of further revenue generating opportunities, while we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde project in Orange County due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket.


The following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities, excluding real estate under developments and commercial properties, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:

(a) Average number of homes is calculated based on the number of stabilized homes outstanding at the end of each

month.

We will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital. Our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement. Recurring capital expenditures during


are projected to be approximately

$1,100

per home.

Real Estate Under Development and Redevelopment

At

December 31, 2013

, our development pipeline for

six

wholly-owned communities totaled

1,765

homes,


of which have been completed, with a budget of

$697.6 million

in which we have a carrying value of

$467.4 million

. During 2013, we incurred $279.6 million for development costs, an increase of $32.7 million from our


level of

$246.9 million

. The estimated completion dates for these communities will be through the second quarter of 2015.


The following wholly-owned projects were under development or recently completed as of

December 31, 2013

(dollars in thousands)

:

(a) This project is held by the Operating Partnership.

(b) Formerly known as The Calvert.

(c) These projects were recently completed but not yet stabilized.

(d) These projects were consolidated in December 2013 due to UDR becoming the managing partner.

During


, we continued to redevelop properties in targeted markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. At December 31, 2013, the Company is redeveloping 1,423 apartment homes, 1,008 of which have been completed, at two wholly-owned communities with 1,670 total apartment homes. The scope of the redevelopments at both projects changed in the fourth quarter. The budget for our Rivergate project in Manhattan expanded due to the identification of further revenue generating opportunities, while we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde project in Orange County due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket. During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, we incurred

$92.1 million

in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings, a decrease of $12.2 million from our


level of $104.3 million. The estimated completion dates for these communities will be through the third quarter of 2014.

At

December 31, 2013

, the following communities were in redevelopment

(dollars in thousands)

:

(a) The community will have 739 homes upon completion.

(b) Formerly known as Pine Brook Village I & II and Villa Venetia. These communities were combined in 2013.

(c) This project is held by the Operating Partnership.

Consolidated Joint Ventures


In December 2013, the Company consolidated its 95%/5% development joint ventures 13

th

and Market in San Diego, CA and Domain College Park in Metropolitan, D.C. The consolidation was due to the Company becoming the managing partner of each of the joint ventures pursuant to amendments to the LLC Agreements. In connection with the amendments, our partner received equity distributions reducing its capital account balances to zero, the Company replaced our partner as the managing partner, and our partner no longer has the ability to substantively participate in the decision-making process, with only protective rights remaining. We accounted for the consolidations as asset acquisitions since the joint ventures were under development and not complete at the time of consolidation resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increasing our real estate owned by $129.4 million and our debt owed by $63.6 million. In addition, pursuant to the amendments, the Company paid a non-refundable deposit to our partner in January 2014 of $2.0 million for each joint venture, or $4.0 million in total, for the right to exercise options in 2014 to acquire our partner’s upside participation in the joint ventures. The non-refundable deposits will be applied towards the future purchase price, which will be equivalent to our partner’s right to receive certain upside participation from the developments.

In May 2012, the Company formed a joint venture with an unaffiliated third party to acquire Pier 4 (land for future development) in Boston, Massachusetts. At closing, UDR owned a 98.0% interest in the joint venture. The Company’s total investment of $26.6 million consisted of our initial investment and the acquisition of its partner’s 2.0% ownership interest in the joint venture in 2012.

In September 2012, the Company formed a joint venture with an unaffiliated third party to acquire 3032 Wilshire (land for future development) in Santa Monica, California. At closing and at December 31, 2013, UDR owned a controlling interest of 95% in the joint venture for an initial investment of $10.3 million.

In October 2012, the Company formed a joint venture with an unaffiliated third party to acquire 2919 Wilshire (land for future development) in Santa Monica, California. At closing and at December 31, 2013, UDR owned a controlling interest of 95% in the joint venture for an initial investment of $7.0 million.

In 2011, the Company invested in a joint venture with an unaffiliated third party to acquire and redevelop Beach Walk, an existing commercial property, into a 173 apartment home community in Huntington Beach, California. At closing, the Company contributed $9.0 million and owned a 90% controlling interest in the investment. Under the terms of the operating agreement, our partner was required to achieve certain criteria as it relates to the entitlement process. If the criteria were met on or before 730 days after the site plan application was deemed complete by the City of Huntington Beach, the Company was obligated to contribute an additional $3.0 million to the joint venture for distribution to our partner. At the acquisition date, the Company accrued and capitalized $3.0 million related to the contingent consideration, which represented the difference between fair value of the property of $9.8 million on the formation date and the estimated fair value of the underlying property upon completion of the entitlement process of $12.8 million. The Company estimated the fair value based on Level 3 inputs utilized in a third party valuation. In 2012, the Company paid the joint venture partner a total of $4.1 million for its 10% noncontrolling interest and settlement of the contingent consideration.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Partnerships

The Company recognizes earnings or losses from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships consisting of our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the joint ventures and partnerships.


The following table summarizes the Company’s investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships, net which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as of

December 31, 2013

and


(dollars in thousands)

:

(*)    The number of apartment homes for the communities under development presented in the table above is based on the projected number of total homes. The number of apartment homes completed as of December 31, 2013 for one development community at UDR/MetLife 399 Fremont was zero.

(a) In June 2013 and within UDR/MetLife I, the Company exchanged with MetLife its approximately

10%

ownership interest in

four

operating communities and paid MetLife an additional

$15.6 million

in cash for an increased ownership interest of approximately 35% in

two

high-rise operating communities, bringing UDR's ownership interest in the

two

high-rise operating communities to

50%

each. The

two

high-rise operating communities are located in Denver, Colorado and San Diego, California and were subsequently contributed to UDR/MetLife II. The four operating communities in which UDR exchanged its ownership interest are located in Metropolitan D.C.; San Francisco, California; Dallas, Texas; and Charlotte, North Carolina. UDR continues to fee manage the four operating communities in which UDR exchanged its ownership interests.


In November 2012, the Company exchanged its

12%

ownership interest in

four

operating communities and

3.1%

ownership in

two

land parcels in UDR/MetLife I, and paid MetLife

$10.0 million

in cash for an additional

41%

ownership interest in The Olivian, a high-rise building located in downtown Seattle, bringing UDR’s ownership interest in The Olivian to

50%

.  The community was contributed to UDR/MetLife II.  The properties and land parcels, in which UDR exchanged its ownership interest, are located in Houston, Texas; Tampa, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Chicago, Illinois.  UDR  continued to fee manage the

four

operating communities.

In January 2012, the Company formed a new real estate joint venture, UDR/MetLife II, with MetLife, in which each party owned a

50%

interest. The


communities in the joint venture included

seven

from UDR/MetLife I, while the remaining

five

operating communities were newly acquired by UDR/MetLife II. The newly acquired communities, collectively known as Columbus Square, were recently developed, high-rise apartment buildings located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and were purchased for

$637.5 million

. The Company serves as the general partner with significant participating rights held by our partner. The Company earns property management, asset management and financing fees. Our initial investment was

$327.1 million

, which consisted of

$293.5 million

of cash paid and

$33.6 million

of our equity in the

seven

communities transferred from UDR/MetLife I.

(b) In June 2013, the Company sold a

50%

interest in

five

partnerships (the “UDR/MetLife Vitruvian Park

®

Partnerships”) to MetLife for approximately

$141.3 million

. The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately

$436,000

which the Company has deferred until the terms of the construction completion guarantee have been met. Under the terms of the UDR/MetLife Vitruvian Park

®

Partnerships, the Company serves as the general partner with significant participating rights held by our partner, and earns fees for property management, asset management, and financing transactions. The UDR/MetLife Vitruvian Park

®

Partnerships are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our initial investment was approximately

$80.2 million

, which consisted of approximately

$140.0 million

(


% of our net book value of the real estate at the time of the transaction) reduced by our share of the net proceeds received upon encumbering the assets of approximately

$58.7 million

and other operating adjustments.

(c) In January 2012, the Company formed a joint venture with an unaffiliated third party to acquire 399 Fremont (land for future development) in the Rincon Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. At closing, UDR owned a noncontrolling interest of 92.5% in the joint venture. The Company’s total investment was $55.5 million, which consisted of its initial investment of $37.3 million and an option to exercise its right to acquire its partner’s 7.5% ownership interest in the joint venture. In October 2012, the Company exercised its option and paid $13.5 million. In January 2013, the Company subsequently acquired its partner’s 7.5% ownership interest for $4.7 million. In December 2013, the Company sold a 49% interest to MetLife in the fully-entitled 399 Fremont land parcel for approximately $29.9 million. In conjunction with the sale, the Company formed a new unconsolidated real estate joint venture with MetLife, UDR/MetLife 399 Fremont, to develop a $318 million, 447-home, luxury high-rise tower on the site. Construction commenced in the first quarter 2014. As the Company recently acquired the 399 Fremont land parcel, the sale price was equivalent to the cost basis resulting in no gain or loss on the transaction. Under the terms of the partnership, the Company serves as the general partner with significant participating rights held by our partner, and has the ability to earn fees for development management, property management, asset management, and financing transactions. The UDR/MetLife 399 Fremont Partnership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our initial investment was approximately $31.1 million.

(d) UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party, which formed a joint venture for the investment of up to

$450 million

in multifamily properties located in key, high barrier to entry markets. The partners will contribute equity of

$180 million

of which the Company’s maximum equity will be

30%

or

$54 million

when fully invested.

(e) During the

year ended

December 31, 2012

, the Company acquired the remaining

80%

ownership interests in

two

apartment communities (


homes) in Austin, Texas for

$11.7 million

from the joint venture. The Company’s investment in the joint venture at

December 31, 2013

and


was net of deferred profits on the sale of depreciable properties to the joint venture of

$24.0 million

and

$28.5 million

, respectively.

(f) In December 2013, the Company sold its 95% interest in the Lodge at Stoughton, a recently developed unconsolidated joint venture community located in the greater Boston area, for approximately $48.5 million, based on our 95% ownership, which resulted in a gain (before tax) of approximately $8.3 million. In conjunction with the sale, the Company provided the buyer with a $40.8 million three-month bridge loan at LIBOR plus a spread of 350 basis points with two three-month extension options at increased rates.


(g) In December 2013, the Company consolidated its 95%/5% development joint ventures 13

th

and Market in San Diego, CA and Domain College Park in Metropolitan, D.C. The consolidation was due to the Company becoming the managing partner of each of the joint ventures. For additional information, see the “Consolidated Joint Ventures” section above.

(h) In October 2013, the Company entered into a participating debt financing arrangement with a third party that is developing a $108 million, 218-home, high-rise luxury community located adjacent to the Cherry Creek mall in Denver, Colorado. Per the terms of the agreement, UDR will finance up to 85%, or approximately $92.0 million, of the development cost at an interest rate of 6.5% per annum on the outstanding debt balance. In addition, the Company has the option to purchase the community upon completion of construction and has a 50% participating interest in the profit upon the acquisition of the community or sale to a third party. The Company will account for the arrangement consistent with an investment in real estate under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2013, our loan receivable balance was $14.3 million which was included in

Investment In and Advances To Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also we recognized $156,000 of interest income included in

Income/(Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Disposition of Investments

In


, UDR sold

two

apartment communities in the Sacramento market, consisting of


apartment homes for gross proceeds of $81.1 million. UDR recognized gains of

$41.9 million

, which are included in

Income/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

on the UDR Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Proceeds were used primarily to fund development and redevelopment activity and reduce debt.

In 2012, UDR sold 21 apartment communities, which had 6,507 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $609.4 million. UDR recognized gains (before tax) of $260.4 million, which are included in

Income/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

on the UDR Consolidated Statements of Operations. Proceeds were used primarily to fund development and redevelopment activity and reduce debt.

In 2011, UDR sold 18 apartment communities (4,488 homes), which included six apartment home communities (1,418 homes) sold in conjunction with an asset exchange in April 2011, for gross proceeds of $593.4 million. UDR recognized gains (before tax) of $138.5 million, which are included in

Income/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

on the UDR Consolidated Statements of Operations. Proceeds were used primarily to acquire apartment home communities and reduce debt.

We plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital to target locations in core markets we believe will provide the best investment returns.

Financing Activities

For the years ended

December 31, 2013

, 2012 and 2011, our net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities was

$(198.6) million

,

$(116.0) million

and

$806.3 million

, respectively.

The following significant financing activities occurred during the

year ended

December 31, 2013

:

•

issued $300 million of 3.70% senior unsecured medium-term notes due October 2020. Interest is payable semiannually beginning in April 2014. We used the net proceeds to repay the borrowings outstanding on our $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Operating Partnership;

•

repaid $46.6 million of secured debt. The $46.6 million of secured debt included $42.2 million of mortgage payments and the repayment of $4.4 million of credit facilities;

•

•

amended and re-priced its $100 million and $250 million unsecured term notes due in January 2016. The notes were re-priced from LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 125 basis points, and the maturity dates were extended to June 2018.

The following significant financing activities occurred during the

year ended

December 31, 2012

:

•

repaid

$491.9 million

of secured debt. The

$491.9 million

of secured debt includes

$157.2 million

•

repaid

$445.0 million

of unsecured debt, which includes

$100 million

of 5.00% Medium Term Notes due January 2012, and net payments of

$345.0 million

were applied toward borrowings under the Company’s $900 million revolving credit facility;

•

issued $400 million in 4.625% Medium Term Notes due January 2022 with a discount of $3.6 million;

•

in September 2011, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement in connection with filing a new registration statement on Form S-3. The new equity distribution agreement replaced the March 2011 agreement, and no material changes were made to the equity distribution agreement. In April 2012, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement, under which the Company could offer and sell up to 20 million shares of its common stock, from time to time, to or through its sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we sold 8,640,969 shares of common stock through these programs (8,569,969 shares remaining under the September 2011 program and 71,000 shares under the April 2012 program) for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $222.1 million at a weighted average price per share of $25.18. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting related expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately $4.5 million, were approximately $217.6 million, and were used to fund development and redevelopment activities, for working capital and for general corporate purposes.  During the year ended December 31, 2013, no shares of common stock were sold under the April 2012 program. As of December 31, 2013, we had 19,929,000 shares of common stock available for sale under the April 2012 program;

•

completed the redemption of all outstanding shares of its 6.75% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. A total of 3,264,362 shares of the Series G Preferred Stock was redeemed at a redemption price of $25 per share in cash, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date for a total cost of $82.1 million; and

•

closed a public offering of 19,000,000 shares of its common stock, in addition to 2,850,000 shares sold as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option in full at the closing, at a price of $25.70 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately $561.5 million and net proceeds of approximately $538.8 million after underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

Credit Facilities

As of

December 31, 2013

, we have secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of

$838.1 million

with

$838.1 million

outstanding. The Fannie Mae credit facilities are for terms of seven to ten years and bear interest at floating and fixed rates. We have

$626.7 million

of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of

4.99%

and the remaining balance of

$211.4 million

on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of

1.61%

at

December 31, 2013

. In June 2013, the Company refinanced $186 million of a Fannie Mae credit facility that carried an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 284 basis points and was scheduled to mature in 2019. The new loans include a $90 million, 7-year fixed-rate loan that carries an interest rate of 3.95% and a $96 million, 10-year variable-rate loan that carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 190 basis points. Three of the Company's communities were released from the facility and added to the Company's unencumbered asset pool in connection with the refinancing.

In June 2013, the Company amended its $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The amendment extended the maturity date from October 2015 to December 2017, includes a six month extension option, and contains an accordion feature that allows the Company to increase the facility to $1.45 billion. Based on the Company's current credit rating, the credit facility carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 110 basis points and a facility fee of 20 basis points. As of

December 31, 2013

, we had

no

outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, leaving

$900 million

of unused capacity (excluding

$2.2 million

of letters of credit at

December 31, 2013

).

The Fannie Mae credit facilities and the bank unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced. We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial


instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets. Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. We had

$404.7

million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of

December 31, 2013

. If market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, our interest expense would increase by $5.5 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These analysis do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.

The Company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. See Note 13,

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

, in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional discussion of derivate instruments.

Funds from Operations, Funds from Operations as Adjusted, and Adjusted Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations

Funds from operations (“FFO”) is defined as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s (“NAREIT”) definition issued in April 2002. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of a REIT’s operating performance. In the computation of diluted FFO, OP Units, unvested restricted stock, stock options, and the shares of Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive; therefore, they are included in the diluted share count.

Activities of taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), RE

3,

include development and land entitlement. From time to time, we develop and subsequently sell a TRS property which results in a short-term use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional long-term investment in real estate for REITs. We believe that the inclusion of these TRS gains in FFO is consistent with the standards established by NAREIT as the short-term investment is incidental to our main business. TRS gains on sales, net of taxes, are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation.

We consider FFO a useful metric for investors as we use FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance, and believe that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs.

Funds from Operations as Adjusted

FFO as Adjusted is defined as FFO excluding the impact of acquisition-related costs and other non-comparable items including, but not limited to, prepayment costs/benefits associated with early debt retirement, gains on sales of marketable securities and TRS property, deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases, storm-related expenses and recoveries, severance costs and legal costs. Management believes that FFO as Adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other REITs.

FFO as Adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. We believe that net income attributable to UDR, Inc. is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO as Adjusted. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures and, accordingly, our FFO as Adjusted may not always be comparable to FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures calculated by other REITs. FFO as Adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity.


Adjusted Funds from Operations

Adjusted FFO, or “AFFO”, is a non-GAAP financial measure that management uses as a supplemental measure of our performance. AFFO is defined as FFO as Adjusted less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities. Therefore, Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company’s operational performance than FFO or FFO as Adjusted.

AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. We believe that net income attributable to UDR, Inc. is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not always be comparable to AFFO calculated by other REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

Results of Operations

The following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, and includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented.

Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders


-vs-


Net income

attributable to common stockholders was

$41.1 million

(

$0.16

per diluted share) for the year ended

December 31, 2013

as compared to

net income

of

$203.4 million

(

$0.85

per diluted share) for the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended

December 31, 2013

resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

a decrease in net gains of $218.5 million on the sale of depreciable property related to the disposition of

two

communities in 2013 as compared to 21 communities in 2012; and

•

a decrease of $12.8 million in tax benefit primarily due to the reversal of our tax valuation allowance during 2012.

This was partially offset by:

•

an increase in total property NOI primarily due to higher occupancy and higher revenue per occupied home partially offset by the disposition of 21 communities in 2012;


•

hurricane-related recoveries in 2013 resulting from the effects of Hurricane Sandy on three of our New York, New York communities in 2012 (see Note 16,

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges

, in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more details);

•

a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012 and intangible assets related to in place leases acquired in 2011 and 2012 becoming fully amortized in 2012, which was partially offset by the depreciation from developed and redeveloped units placed in service in 2012 and 2013;

•

a decrease in loss from unconsolidated entities primarily due to an $8.3 million gain ($5.3 million net of tax expense) on the sale of our 95% interest in the Lodge at Stoughton; and

•

a decrease in interest expense due to lower average debt balances, lower average interest rates, and higher capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities.


-vs-


Net income attributable to common stockholders was $203.4 million ($0.85 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to net income of $10.5 million ($0.05 per diluted share) for the comparable period in the prior year. The increase in net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

an increase in total property NOI primarily due to higher occupancy and higher revenue per occupied home and the acquisition of operating communities partially offset by a higher level of dispositions in 2012;

•

an increase in net gains of $126.3 million on the sale of depreciable property related to the disposition of 21 communities in 2012 as compared to 18 communities in 2011;

•

an increase in tax benefit of $28.7 million primarily due to the reversal of our tax valuation allowance in 2012;

•

a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012 and 2011, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense due to the acquisition of operating communities in 2012 and 2011 and depreciation from developed and redeveloped units placed in service in 2011 and 2012; and

•

a decrease in interest expense due to early debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2012, and the write off of $4.0 million of deferred financing costs related to prepayment of debt in 2011.

This was partially offset by:

•

hurricane-related charges in 2012 resulting from the effects of Hurricane Sandy on three of our New York, New York communities in 2012 (see Note 16,

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges

, in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more details).

Apartment Community Operations

Our net income results are primarily from net operating income (“NOI”) generated from the operation of our apartment communities. The Company defines NOI, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt.  Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing.  Excluded from NOI is property management expense which is calculated as 2.75% of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent.


The following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property NOI (which includes discontinued operations) for each of the periods presented

(dollars in thousands):

(a)

Same-store consists of 35,790 apartment homes.

(b)

Same-store consists of 33,823 apartment homes.

(c)

Excludes depreciation, amortization, and property management expenses.

The following table is our reconciliation of total property NOI to

Same -Store Communities


-vs-


Our same-store community properties (those acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2012

and held on

December 31, 2013

) consisted of

35,790

apartment homes and provided

83%

of our total NOI for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

.

NOI for our same-store community properties

increased

6.0%

or

$23.9 million

for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

compared to the same period in


. The

increase

in property NOI was attributable to a 4.9% or $28.7 million increase in property rental income, which was partially offset by a 2.6% or $4.8 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 4.0% or $22.7 million increase in rental rates and a 7.7% or $3.6 million increase in reimbursement and fee income. Physical occupancy increased 0.2% to 96.0% and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 4.7% to $1,488.

The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 6.7% or $3.9 million increase in real estate tax and a 4.6% or $2.0 million increase in personnel costs, which was partially offset by a 4.2% or $1.3 million decrease in repair and maintenance expense.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income)

increased

to

69.2%

for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

as compared to

68.5%

for the comparable period in


.


-vs-


Our same store community properties (those acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to January 1, 2011 and held on December 31, 2012) consisted of 33,823 apartment homes and provided 70% of our total NOI for the year ended December 31, 2012.

NOI for our same-store community properties increased 6.6% or $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. The increase in property NOI was attributable to a 5.3% or $26.2 million increase in property rental income partially offset by a 2.8% or $4.5 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 4.6% or $22.1 million increase in rental rates and a 7.2% or $3.0 million increase in reimbursement and fee income. Physical occupancy increased 0.1% to 95.7% and total monthly income per occupied home increased 5.2% to $1,331.

The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 9.0% or $4.4 million increase in real estate tax and a 4.5% or $1.2 million increase in repairs and maintenance costs, which was partially offset by a 3.4% or $1.4 million decrease in personnel expense.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income) increased to 67.9% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 67.1% for the comparable period in 2011.

Non-Mature Communities/Other


-vs-


The remaining

$89.5 million

or

17%

of our total NOI for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

was generated from our non-mature communities/other. UDR’s non-mature communities/other consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, which includes communities developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold or held for sale properties, and non-apartment components of mixed use properties. NOI from non-mature communities/other

decreased

by

13.6%

or

$14.1 million

for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

compared to the same period in


. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in NOI of

73.5%

or

$22.0 million

from communities sold in 2012, partially offset by an increase in NOI of $5.2 million from development communities completed in 2012 and 2013, an increase in NOI of

15.5%

or

$2.6 million

from communities acquired in 2011 and 2012, and an increase in NOI of

7.1%

or

$3.0 million

from communities redeveloped in 2012 and 2013.



-vs-


The remaining

$153.5 million

and

$155.7 million

of our total NOI for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, was generated from our non-mature communities/other. NOI from non-mature communities

decreased

by

1.4%

or

$2.2 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2012

compared to the same period in


. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in NOI of

70.6%

or

$47.5 million

from communities sold in 2012 and 2011, partially offset by an increase in NOI of

93.8%

or

$29.4 million

from communities acquired in 2011 and 2012 and an increase in NOI of

31.3%

or

$11.3 million

from redeveloped communities completed in 2012 and 2011. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2012, a $2.3 million increase to NOI was recognized to reflect the establishment of a receivable from former residents previously written off at move-out.

Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the

year ended

December 31, 2013

, real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations

decreased

2.5%

or

$8.9 million

as compared to the comparable period in 2012. The

decrease

in depreciation and amortization for the year ended

December 31, 2013

was primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012 and intangible assets related to in place leases acquired in 2011 and 2012 becoming fully amortized in 2012. The decrease was partially offset by the depreciation from developed and redeveloped units placed in service in 2012 and 2013.

For the

year ended

December 31, 2012

, real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 5.4% or $19.9 million as compared to the comparable periods in


. The decrease in depreciation and amortization for the

year ended

December 31, 2012

was primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense due to the acquisition of operating communities in 2012 and 2011 and depreciation from developed and redeveloped units placed in service in 2011 and 2012.

General and Administrative

For the

year ended

December 31, 2013

, general and administrative expense

decreased

3.5% or $1.6 million from the comparable period in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to acquisition costs incurred in 2012.

For the

year ended

December 31, 2012

, general and administrative expense decreased 7.3% or $3.5 million from the comparable period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower acquisition costs of $2.5 million in 2012, which was attributable to less acquisition activity in 2012 as compared to 2011.

Interest Expense

For the

year ended

December 31, 2013

, interest expense

decreased

by

9.2%

or

$12.7 million

as compared to the comparable period in


. The

decrease

in interest expense was primarily due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates and higher capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities.

For the year ended

December 31, 2012

, interest expense decreased 11.2% or $17.6 million as compared to 2011. This decrease in interest expense was primarily due to early debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2012, and the write off of $4.0 million of deferred financing cost related to the prepayment of debt in 2011.

Tax Benefit, Net

UDR elected for RE


to be treated as a TRS. Income taxes for RE


are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date.


The Company recognized an income tax benefit from RE


of $8.3 million and $21.1 million and an income tax expense of $7.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Included in 2012 is an income tax benefit of $43.7 million from RE


, which resulted from the reversal of a net deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Prior to 2012, RE


had a history of losses and, as a result, had historically recognized a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets.  Each quarter, the Company evaluates the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. In the first quarter of 2012, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, including any remaining net operating losses, will be realized.  In making this determination, the Company analyzed, among other things, its recent history of earnings, forecasts of future earnings from sales of depreciable property, and its cumulative earnings for the last twelve quarters.

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges, Net

In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, affecting

three

of the Company’s operating communities (

1,706

apartment homes) located in New York City. The properties suffered some physical damage, and were closed to residents for a period following the hurricane. The Company has insurance policies that provide coverage for property damage and business interruption, subject to applicable retention.

Based on the claims filed and management’s estimates, the Company recognized a

$9.0 million

impairment charge for the damaged assets’ net book value and incurred

$10.4 million

of repair and cleanup costs during the year ended December 31, 2012. The impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred were reduced as of

December 31, 2012

by

$14.5 million

of estimated insurance recovery, and were classified in

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges, Ne

t on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended

December 31, 2013

,

no

material adjustments to the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred were recognized. With the exception of one of the properties that is under redevelopment at

December 31, 2013

, the rehabilitation of the remaining two properties was substantially completed as of December 31, 2013.

As of December 31, 2013, the Company had settled the Hurricane Sandy claims and received insurance proceeds in excess of the

$14.5 million

estimated insurance recovery receivable related to the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred. As a result, the Company recognized a Hurricane-related recovery of approximately

$4.8 million

and a casualty gain of approximately

$654,000

for the year ended December 31, 2013. Both the recovery and casualty gain were classified in

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges, Ne

t on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Based on the claims filed and management’s estimates, the Company recognized

$4.4 million

of business interruption losses for the year ended December 31, 2012, of which

$3.6 million

were related to rent concession rebates provided to residents during the period the properties were uninhabitable and were classified in

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges, Ne

t on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and

$767,000

were related to rent that was not contractually receivable and were classified as a reduction to

Rental income

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  As noted below, the Company recovered from the insurance carrier approximately $4.2 million of the $4.4 million of 2012 business interruption losses. The Company estimates that it incurred an additional

$3.4 million

of business interruption losses for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

. As noted below, the Company recovered from the insurance carrier approximately $2.6 million of the $3.4 million of 2013 business interruption losses.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company received approximately

$6.8 million

of insurance proceeds for recovery of business interruption losses. Of the

$6.8 million

of insurance proceeds received in 2013,

$4.2 million

related to recovery of business interruption losses incurred in 2012 and the remaining

$2.6 million

related to recovery of business interruption losses incurred in 2013. The

$6.8 million

of recovery was classified in

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges, Ne

t on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as of

December 31, 2013

.

Income/(Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities

For the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, we recognized losses from unconsolidated entities of $415,000, $8.6 million, and $6.4 million, respectively. These losses relate to our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships and are included in

Income/(Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities

on the UDR Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this Report. The decrease in loss in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to an $8.3 million gain ($5.3 million net of tax expense) on the sale of our 95% interest in the Lodge at Stoughton.

Net Gain/(Loss) on the Sale of Depreciable Properties

For the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


, we recognized gains (before tax) of

$41.9 million

,

$260.4 million

, and

$138.5 million

, respectively. These gains are included in

Income/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax


on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of UDR included in this Report. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, the majority of our leases are for a term of fourteen months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2013

(dollars in thousands):

(a)

Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments are based on each debt instrument’s respective year-end interest rate at

December 31, 2013

.

(b)

Any unfunded costs at

December 31, 2013

are shown in the year of estimated completion.

(c)

Represents remainder of unfunded $92.0 million participating debt financing arrangement.

(d)

For purposes of our ground lease contracts, the Company uses the minimum lease payment, if stated in the agreement. For ground lease agreements where there is a reset provision based on the communities appraised value or consumer price index but does not included a specified minimum lease payment, the Company uses the current rent over the remainder of the lease term.

During


, we incurred gross interest costs of $155.5 million, of which

$29.4 million

was capitalized.


UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.:

Business Overview

United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or “UDR, L.P.”), is a Delaware limited partnership formed in February 2004 and organized pursuant to the provisions of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (as amended from time to time, or any successor to such statute, the “Act”). The Operating Partnership is the successor-in-interest to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations on November 4, 1995. Our sole general partner is UDR, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“UDR” or the “General Partner”), which conducts a substantial amount of its business and holds a substantial amount of its assets through the Operating Partnership. At

December 31, 2013

, the Operating Partnership’s real estate portfolio included


communities located in

nine

states and the District of Columbia with a total of

20,746

apartment homes.

As of

December 31, 2013

, UDR owned

110,883

units of our general limited partnership interests and

173,848,891

units of our limited partnership interests (the “OP Units”), or approximately

94.9%

of our outstanding OP Units. By virtue of its ownership of our OP Units and being our sole general partner, UDR has the ability to control all of the day-to-day operations of the Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Report to the Operating Partnership or “we,” “us” or “our” refer to UDR, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our General Partner together with its consolidated subsidiaries (including us) and the General Partner’s consolidated joint ventures as “UDR” or the “General Partner.”

UDR is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities. The General Partner was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation and changed its state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland in September 2003. At

December 31, 2013

, the General Partner’s consolidated real estate portfolio included


communities located in


states and the District of Columbia with a total of

41,250

apartment homes. In addition, the General Partner had an ownership interest in


communities with

9,909

completed apartment homes through unconsolidated operating communities.

At December 31, 2013, the Operating Partnership is developing one wholly-owned community with 332 apartment homes, none of which have been completed.

At December 31, 2013, the Operating Partnership is redeveloping 748 apartment homes, 629 of which have been completed, at one wholly-owned community with 964 apartment homes. The scope of the redevelopment project changed in the fourth quarter. We tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde project in Orange County due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty. Estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, to the Notes to the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Cost Capitalization

In conformity with GAAP, we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.

In addition, we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. As each home in a capital


project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Operating Partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion. The costs capitalized are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as

Total Real Estate Owned, Net of Accumulated Depreciation.

Amounts capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, were $8.4 million, $5.8 million, and $4.0 million, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

Real Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components, such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases, based on the fair value of each component. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including independent appraisals, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As such, the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease-up period. We determine the fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up period, and the carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. The fair value of in-place leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period.


Summary of Real Estate Portfolio by Geographic Market

The following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

(a)

Monthly Income per Occupied Home represents total revenues divided by the product of occupancy and the number of mature apartment homes.

(b)

As of December 31, 2013, the Operating Partnership was developing one wholly-owned community with 332 apartment homes, none of which have been completed.

We report in two segments:

Same-Store Communities

and

Non-Mature Communities/Other

.

Our

Same-Store Communities

segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2012

and held as of

December 31, 2013

. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and


the communities are not held for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.

Our

Non-Mature Communities/Other

segment represents those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011, 2012 or 2013, sold properties, redevelopment properties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale of properties, and the issuance of debt. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. The Operating Partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the General Partner’s credit agreements. The General Partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. During the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the General Partner’s credit agreements. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties. We believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations, and borrowings allocated to us under the General Partner’s credit agreements.

Future Capital Needs

Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt, sales of properties, borrowings allocated to us under our General Partner’s credit agreements, and to a lesser extent, from cash flows provided by operating activities.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the Operating Partnership had approximately

$8.9 million

of principal payments on secured debt maturing in


. We anticipate that we will repay that debt with operating cash flows or proceeds from borrowings allocated to us under our General Partner’s credit agreements. The repayment of debt will be recorded as an offset to the

Payable/(Receivable) Due To/(From) General Partner

Statements of Cash Flows

The following discussion explains the changes in net cash

provided by

operating activities, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities, and net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


.

Operating Activities

For the

year ended

December 31, 2013

, net cash flow

provided by

operating activities was

$208.3 million

compared to

$201.1 million

for the comparable period in


. The

increase in

net cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved income from continuing operations, offset by changes in operating assets and operating liabilities.

For the year ended

December 31, 2012

, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $201.1 million compared to $156.1 million for the comparable period in


. The increase in net cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio and changes in operating assets and operating liabilities.

Investing Activities

For the

year ended

December 31, 2013

, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was

$(64.0) million

compared to

$4.3 million

for the comparable period in


. The change was primarily due to the increase in development and redevelopment activities and a decrease in dispositions. Changes in the level of investment activities from period to period reflect our strategy as it relates to dispositions, development, redevelopment, and capital expenditures.


For the year ended

December 31, 2012

, net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was

$4.3 million

compared to

$(227.0) million

for the comparable period in


. Changes in the level of investment activities from period to period reflect our strategy as it relates to acquisitions, dispositions, development, redevelopment, and capital expenditures.

Acquisitions

The Operating Partnership did not have any acquisitions during the year ended

December 31, 2013

and 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Operating Partnership acquired four communities with 1,833 apartment homes for $761.2 million.

Real Estate Under Development and Redevelopment

At

December 31, 2013

, the Operating Partnership was developing one wholly-owned community that totaled 332 homes, none of which have been completed, with a budget of $132.0 million, in which we had a carrying value of $80.1 million. The estimated completion date for this community will be through the third quarter of 2014.

At

December 31, 2013

, the Operating Partnership was redeveloping 748 apartment homes, 629 of which have been completed, at one wholly-owned community with 964 apartment homes. The scope of the redevelopment project changed in the fourth quarter. We tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 Seventy Five Mesa Verde project in Orange County due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket. The estimated completion date for this community will be through the second quarter of 2014.

The following wholly-owned projects were under development and redevelopment as of

December 31, 2013

(dollars in thousands)

:

(a) Formerly known as The Calvert.

(b) Formerly known as Pine Brook Village I & II and Villa Venetia. These communities were combined in 2013.

(c) Of the 964 apartment homes, 748 are scheduled for redevelopment.

Disposition of Investments

In 2013, the Operating Partnership sold

two

apartment communities in the Sacramento market, consisting of


apartment homes for gross proceeds of $81.1 million. The Operating Partnership recognized a gain of

$41.5 million

, which is included in

Income/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations

on the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this Report. Proceeds were used primarily to fund development and redevelopment activity and reduce debt.

Also in 2013, the Operating Partnership distributed the development property Los Alisos to the General Partner as a capital distribution. Upon the distribution of the property, the Operating Partnership redeemed

1,002,556

limited partnership units owned by UDR and affiliated entities and reduced its receivable from the General Partner by

$53.7 million

, resulting in a net capital reduction of

$77.0 million

.

In 2012, the Operating Partnership sold four communities with 1,314 apartment homes for a gain of $51.1 million.

In 2011, the Operating Partnership sold eight communities with 2,024 apartment homes, which included four communities with 984 homes sold in conjunction with an asset exchange, for a gain of $60.1 million.

Financing Activities

For the

year ended

December 31, 2013

, our net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities was

$(145.3) million

compared to

$(203.3) million

for the comparable period of


. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was


primarily due to a decrease in payments on secured debt, a decrease in advances from the General Partner, and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of secured debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, our net cash provided/(used in) by financing activities was $(203.3) million compared to net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities of $70.7 million for 2011.  The change in cash provided by/(used in) financing activities was primarily due to an increase in payments on secured debt and a decrease in advances from the General Partner, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of secured debt.

Credit Facilities

As of

December 31, 2013

, the General Partner had secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of

$838.1 million

with

$838.1 million

outstanding. The Fannie Mae credit facilities are for terms of seven to

ten years

and bear interest at floating and fixed rates. At

December 31, 2013

,

$626.7 million

of the funded balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of

4.99%

and the remaining balance of $211.4 million on these facilities was at a weighted average variable rate of

1.61%

. In 2013, the General Partner reallocated an additional

$13.7 million

of the Fannie Mae credit facilities to the Operating Partnership. At

December 31, 2013

, there was a total of

$521.1 million

of these credit facilities allocated to the Operating Partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt.

The Operating Partnership is a guarantor on the General Partner’s unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of

$900 million

,

$250 million

of term notes due

June 2018

,

$100 million

of term notes due

June 2018

,

$300 million

of medium-term notes due

June 2018

,

$300 million

of medium-term notes due

October 2020

, and

$400 million

of medium-term notes due

January 2022

.  As of

December 31, 2013

, there was no outstanding borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility. As of

December 31, 2012

, the outstanding balance under the unsecured revolving credit facility was

$76.0 million

.

The credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced. We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets. Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. We had

$169.1 million

in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of

December 31, 2013

. If market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by


basis points, our interest expense would increase by

$1.7 million

based on the balance at

December 31, 2013

.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.

The General Partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments allocated to the Operating Partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. See Note 8,

Derivatives and Hedging Activity

, in the Notes to the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional discussion of derivative instruments.

Results of Operations

The following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


, and includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented.

Net Income(Loss) Attributable to OP Unitholders


-vs-


Net income/(loss) attributable to OP unitholders was

$73.4 million

(

$0.40

per OP Unit) for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

as compared to

$44.0 million

(

$0.24

per OP Unit) for the comparable period in the prior year. The

increase

in net income


attributable to OP unitholders resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

an increase in total property NOI primarily due to higher occupancy and higher revenue per occupied home, partially offset by a decrease in NOI due to the disposition of four communities in 2012;

•

a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012, partially offset by the depreciation from developed or redeveloped units placed in service in 2012 and 2013;

•

hurricane-related recoveries in 2013 resulting from the effects of Hurricane Sandy on two of our New York, New York communities in 2012 (see Note 13,

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges

, in the Notes to the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more details); and

•

a decrease in interest expense due to lower average debt balances, lower average interest rates, and higher capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities.

This was partially offset by:

•

a decrease in net gains of $9.6 million on the sale of depreciable properties related to the disposition of two communities in 2013 as compared to four communities in 2012.


-vs-


Net income/(loss) attributable to OP unitholders was $44.0 million ($0.24 per OP Unit) for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $30.2 million ($0.17 per OP Unit) for the comparable period in the prior year. The increase in net income attributable to OP unitholders resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

an increase in total property NOI primarily due to higher revenue per occupied home and the acquisition of four communities in 2011; and

•

a decrease in interest expense due to early debt extinguishment and an increase in capitalized interest in 2012.

This was partially offset by:

•

a decrease in net gains of $9.0 million on the sale of depreciable property related to the disposition of four communities in 2012 as compared to eight communities in 2011; and

•

hurricane-related charges in 2012 resulting from the effects of Hurricane Sandy on three of our New York, New York communities in 2012 (see Note 13,

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges

, in the Notes to the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more details).

Apartment Community Operations

Our net income results primarily from net operating income (“NOI”) generated from the operation of our apartment communities. The Operating Partnership defines NOI, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as rental income less direct property rental expenses.  Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt.  Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing.  Excluded from NOI is property management expense which is calculated as 2.75% of property revenue to cover regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent.


The following table summarizes the operating performance of our total portfolio (which includes discontinued operations) for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


(dollars in thousands)

:

(a)

Same-store consists of 18,616 apartment homes.

(b)

Same-store consists of 17,880 apartment homes.

(c)

Excludes depreciation, amortization, and property management expenses.

Same-Store Communities


-vs-


Our same-store community properties (those acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2012

and held on

December 31, 2013

) consisted of

18,616

apartment homes and provided

84%

of our total NOI for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.


NOI for our same-store community properties

increased

5.9%

or

$13.3 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

compared to the same period in 2012. The

increase

in property NOI was primarily attributable to a

5.1%

or

$16.6 million

increase

in property rental income, which was partially offset by a

3.3%

or

$3.3 million

increase

in operating expenses. The

increase

in revenues was primarily driven by a

4.3%

or

$13.7 million

increase

in rental rates and a

6.8%

or

$1.8 million

increase

in reimbursement and fee income.  Physical occupancy increased 0.2% to

95.8%

and total monthly income per occupied home

increased

by 4.8% to

$1,609

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

compared to the same period in


.

The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a

7.0%

or

$2.3 million

increase in real estate tax and a

5.2%

or

$1.2 million

increase in personnel costs, which was partially offset by a

3.1%

or

$502,000

decrease in repairs and maintenance costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income) increased to

70.0%

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

as compared to

69.5%

for the comparable period in


.


-vs-


Our same-store community properties (those acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to January 1, 2011 and held on

December 31, 2012

) consisted of 17,880 apartment homes and provided 72% of our total NOI for the year ended

December 31, 2012

.

NOI for our same-store community properties increased 6.5% or $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. The increase in property NOI was primarily attributable to a 5.5% or $15.3 million increase in property rental income, partially offset by a 3.2% or $2.9 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 5.2% or $14.0 million increase in rental rates and a 7.7% or $1.9 million increase in reimbursement and fee income.  Physical occupancy remained the same at 95.4% and total monthly income per occupied home increased 5.5% to $1,439 for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.

The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 7.2% or $2.1 million increase in real estate tax and a 6.5% or $906,000 increase in repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by a 2.2% or $474,000 decrease in personnel costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income) increased to 68.8% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 68.1% for the comparable period in 2011.

Non-Mature Communities/Other


-vs-


The remaining

$46.3 million

or

16%

of our total NOI during the year ended

December 31, 2013

was generated from our non-mature communities/other. The Operating Partnership’s non-mature communities/other consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, which includes communities developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold or held for sale properties, and non-apartment components of mixed use properties. NOI from non-mature communities/other decreased

13.7%

or

$(7.3) million

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

compared to the same period in


. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in NOI of

45.8%

or

$4.7 million

from properties sold during


and


,  a decrease in NOI of

24.3%

or

$2.2 million

from commercial/other properties, and a decrease of

6.2%

or

$1.2 million

from redevelopment properties.


-vs-


The remaining

$78.9 million

or 28% of our NOI during the year ended

December 31, 2012

was generated from our non-mature communities/other. NOI from non-mature communities/other increased 6.5% or $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in NOI of 76.4% or $17.2 million from communities acquired in 2011 and an increase of 14.4% or $3.2 million from redevelopment properties, including communities completed in 2012. The increase in NOI was partially offset by a decrease in NOI of 77.9% or $15.9 million from properties sold during 2012 and 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2012, a $1.2 million increase to NOI was recognized to reflect the establishment of a receivable from former residents previously written off at move out.


Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended

December 31, 2013

, real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations

decreased

by

7.0%

or

$13.7 million

as compared to the comparable period in


. The decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended

December 31, 2013

was primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations

decreased

by

1.5%

or

$2.9 million

as compared to the comparable period in 2011. The decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily the result of acquisitions in 2011 and dispositions of assets in 2011 and 2012. As part of the Operating Partnership’s acquisition activity, a portion of the purchase price was attributable to the fair value of intangible assets, which are typically amortized over a period of less than one year.

Hurricane-Related Recoveries/(Charges), Net

In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, affecting

two

of the Operating Partnership’s operating communities (

1,001

apartment homes) located in New York City. The properties suffered some physical damage, and were closed to residents for a period following the hurricane. The Operating Partnership has insurance policies that provide coverage for property damage and business interruption, subject to applicable retention.

Based on the claims filed and management’s estimates, the Operating Partnership recognized a

$7.1 million

impairment charge for the damaged assets’ net book value and incurred

$7.0 million

of repair and cleanup costs during the year ended December 31, 2012. The impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred were reduced as of December 31, 2012 by

$10.8 million

of estimated insurance recovery, and were classified in

Hurricane Related (Recoveries)/Charges, Net

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the

year ended

December 31, 2013

,

no

material adjustments to the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred were recognized. The rehabilitation of these

two

properties was substantially completed as of December 31, 2013.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the Operating Partnership had settled the Hurricane Sandy claims and received insurance proceeds in excess of the

$10.8 million

estimated insurance recovery receivable related to the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred. As a result, the Company recognized a Hurricane-related recovery of approximately

$3.3 million

and a casualty gain of approximately

$582,000

for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

. Both the recovery and casualty gain were classified in

Hurricane Related (Recoveries)/Charges, Net

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Based on the claims filed and management’s estimates, the Operating Partnership recognized

$2.2 million

of business interruption losses for the year ended December 31, 2012, of which

$1.8 million

were related to rent concession rebates provided to residents during the period the properties were uninhabitable and were classified in

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges, Net

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and

$400,000

were related to rent that was not contractually receivable and were classified as a reduction to

Rental Income

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company estimates that it incurred an additional

$2.1 million

of business interruption losses for the

year ended

December 31, 2013

. As noted, the Company settled the Hurricane Sandy claims as of

December 31, 2013

.

During the

year ended

December 31, 2013

, the Operating Partnership received approximately

$4.2 million

of insurance proceeds for recovery of business interruption losses. Of the

$4.2 million

of insurance proceeds received during the

year ended

December 31, 2013

,

$2.1 million

related to recovery of business interruption losses incurred in 2012 and the remaining

$2.1 million

related to recovery of business interruption losses incurred in 2013. The

$4.2 million

of recovery was included in

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges, Net

on the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this Report.

Interest Expense

For the year ended

December 31, 2013

, interest expense

decreased

by

20.3%

or

$9.2 million

as compared to the same period in


, which was primarily due to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates, and higher capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, interest expense

decreased

by 15.7% or $8.4 million as compared to the same period in 2011, which was primarily due to lower debt balances from the pay off of certain fixed rate mortgage notes payable and lower average borrowings on secured credit facilities and an increase in capitalized interest due to increased development and redevelopment activity.


Net Gain/(Loss) on the Sale of Depreciable Properties

For the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


, we recognized gains on sale of depreciable property of $41.5 million, $51.1 million, and $60.1 million, respectively. These gains are included in

Income/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations

on the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this Report. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold.

Net (Income)/Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

For the year ended December 31, 2013, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $4.6 million as compared to $352,000 for the comparable period in 2012. The increase of $4.2 million was primarily due to the Operating Partnership correcting an error in the General Partner’s ownership interest in one of the consolidated subsidiaries resulting in a cumulative adjustment recorded in 2013 of $3.3 million. Management believes the impact of the cumulative adjustment in 2013 is immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended

December 31, 2013

.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2013

(

dollars in thousands

):

(a)

Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments are based on each debt instruments respective year-end interest rate at

December 31, 2013

.

(b)

Any unfunded costs at

December 31, 2013

are shown in the year of estimated completion.

(c)

For purposes of our ground lease contracts, the Operating Partnership uses the minimum lease payment, if stated in the agreement. For ground lease agreements where there is a reset provision based on the communities appraised value or consumer price index but does not include a specified minimum lease payment, the Operating Partnership uses the current rent over the remainder of the lease term.

Item 9A.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the Operating Partnership are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. As a result, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such disclosure controls and procedures will meet their objectives.

As of

December 31, 2013

, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, which is the sole General Partner of the Operating Partnership of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the Operating Partnership. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the Operating Partnership are effective at the reasonable assurance level described above.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act for the Company and the Operating Partnership. Under the supervision and with the participation of the management, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, which is the sole General Partner of the Operating Partnership, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (1992 Framework) (COSO). Based on such evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s and the Operating Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2013

.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Report, has audited UDR, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

. The report of Ernst & Young LLP, which expresses an unqualified opinion on UDR, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

, is included under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” of UDR, Inc. contained in this Report. Further, an attestation report of the registered public accounting firm of United Dominion Realty, L.P. will not be required as long as United Dominion Realty, L.P. is a non-accelerated filer.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have not been any changes in either the Company’s or the Operating Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth fiscal quarter to which this report relates that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of either the Company or the Operating Partnership.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of UDR, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UDR, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of UDR, Inc. at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), UDR, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) and our report dated

February 25, 2014

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of UDR, Inc.

We have audited UDR, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (the COSO criteria). UDR, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, UDR, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of UDR, Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 and our report dated

February 25, 2014

, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

DECEMBER 31, 2013

1. CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Organization and Formation

UDR, Inc. (“UDR,” the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages apartment communities generally in high barrier-to-entry markets located in the United States. The high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive single-family home prices and significant employment growth potential. At

December 31, 2013

, our consolidated apartment portfolio consisted of


consolidated communities located in


markets consisting of

41,250

apartment homes. In addition, the Company has an ownership interest in

9,909

apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of UDR include its wholly-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries (see the “Consolidated Joint Ventures” section of Note 5,

Joint Ventures and Partnerships

, for further discussion). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UDR and its subsidiaries, including United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or the “OP”). As of

December 31, 2013

and


, there were

183,278,698

and

184,281,253

units, respectively, in the Operating Partnership outstanding, of which

173,959,774

units or

94.9%

and

174,886,035

or

94.9%

, respectively, were owned by UDR and

9,318,924

units or

5.1%

and

9,395,218

or

5.1%

, respectively, were owned by limited partners. The consolidated financial statements of UDR include the noncontrolling interests of the unitholders in the Operating Partnership.

The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date its financial statements were issued. No significant recognized or non-recognized subsequent events were noted other than those mentioned in Note 3,

Real Estate Owned

, and Note 6

, Secured and Unsecured Debt

.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-10,

Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.

The objective of this update is to provide enhanced disclosures that will enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position. This included the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with an entity’s recognized assets and recognized liabilities within the scope of this update. The amendments require enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either 1) offset on the balance sheet in accordance with the “Offsetting Guidance” in ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45 (collectively, the offsetting guidance) or 2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, regardless of whether they are offset in accordance with the “Offsetting Guidance”. The amendments, which were adopted by the Company on January 1, 2013, impacted the Company’s disclosures related to its derivative activities. (See Note 13,

Derivatives and Hedging Activity

.) The new guidance did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In February 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02

, Other Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)

to require preparers to report, in one place, information about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). For significant items reclassified out of AOCI to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period, reporting (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes thereto) is required about the effect of the reclassifications on the respective line items in the statement where net income is presented. For items that are not reclassified to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period, a cross reference to other existing disclosures is required in the notes. The amendments, which were adopted by the Company on January 1, 2013, did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the required disclosures in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income/(Loss) or in the notes thereto for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.

DECEMBER 31, 2013

Real Estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and other costs incurred during their development, acquisition and redevelopment.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition and/or improvement of real estate assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the expenditures qualify as a betterment or the life of the related asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life expectancy.

UDR purchases real estate investment properties and records the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair value. The primary, although not only, identifiable intangible asset associated with our portfolio is the value of existing lease agreements. When recording the acquisition of a community, we first assign fair value to the estimated intangible value of the existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the land, building and fixtures assuming the community is vacant. The Company estimates the intangible value of the lease agreements by determining the lost revenue associated with a hypothetical lease-up. Depreciation on the building is based on the expected useful life of the asset and the in-place leases are amortized over their remaining average contractual life. Property acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

Quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant, UDR will assess our real estate properties for indicators of impairment. In determining whether the Company has indicators of impairment in our real estate assets, we assess whether the long-lived asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s undiscounted future cash flows, which is representative of projected net operating income (“NOI”) plus the residual value of the community. Our future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. If such indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties classified as real estate held for sale generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months. Real estate held for sale is carried at the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less the cost to sell, determined on an asset-by-asset basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for sale properties are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to held for sale properties are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for sale.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which are

35 to 55 years

for buildings,

10 to 35 years

for major improvements, and

3 to 10 years

for furniture, fixtures, equipment, and other assets. As of

December 31, 2013

and


, the amount of our net intangible assets, which are reflected in

Other Assets

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets

,

was

$9.0 million

and

$11.9 million

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2013

and


, the amount of our net intangible liabilities, which are reflected in

Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Other Liabilities

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was

$4.4 million

and

$5.2 million

. The balances are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective intangible.

Predevelopment, development, and redevelopment projects and related costs are capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as

Total Real Estate Owned, Net of Accumulated Depreciation

. The Company capitalizes costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. These costs, excluding the direct costs of development and redevelopment and capitalized interest, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 were

$11.1 million

,

$10.0 million

and

$10.0 million

, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, total interest capitalized was

$29.4 million

,

$26.4 million

, and

$13.0 million

, respectively. As each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Company ceases capitalization on the related portion and depreciation commences over the estimated useful life.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short-term, highly liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and security deposits.

Revenue and Real Estate Sales Gain Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents and tenants in accordance with GAAP. Rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis and recognized when earned. The Company recognizes interest income, management and other fees and incentives when earned, and the amounts are fixed and determinable.

For sale transactions meeting the requirements for full accrual profit recognition, we remove the related assets and liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes. For sale transactions that do not meet the full accrual sale criteria due to our continuing involvement, we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement and account for the transaction under an alternate method of accounting. Unless certain limited criteria are met, non-monetary transactions, including property exchanges, are accounted for at fair value.

Sales to entities in which we retain or otherwise own an interest are accounted for as partial sales. If all other requirements for recognizing profit under the full accrual method have been satisfied and no other forms of continuing involvement are present, we recognize profit proportionate to the outside interest in the buyer and defer the gain on the interest we retain. The Company recognizes any deferred gain when the property is sold to a third party. In transactions accounted for by us as partial sales, we determine if the buyer of the majority equity interest in the venture was provided a preference as to cash flows in either an operating or a capital waterfall. If a cash flow preference has been provided, we recognize profit only to the extent that proceeds from the sale of the majority equity interest exceed costs related to the entire property.

Notes Receivable

The following table summarizes our notes receivable, net as of

December 31, 2013

and 2012 (

dollars in thousands

):

(a) In conjunction with the sale of its

.  Interest payments are due monthly and the note is due

June 2022

. The discount is amortized using the effective interest method.

During the years ended

December 31, 2013

, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized

$4.1 million

,

$2.7 million

and

$646,000

of interest income, net of accretion, from these notes receivable, of which

$765,000

,

$281,000

and

$0

, respectively, were related party interest income. Interest income is included in

Interest and Other Income/(Expense), Net

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Marketable Securities

During the

year ended

December 31, 2011, the Company sold marketable securities for

$3.5 million

, resulting in a realized gain of

$3.1 million

, which is included in

Interest and Other Income/(Expense), Net

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of securities sold was based on the specific identification method. Unrealized gains of

$3.5 million

were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings during the

year ended

December 31, 2011. The marketable securities, which represented common stock in a publicly held company, were classified as “available-for-sale,” and were carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income/(loss).

Investment in Joint Ventures and Partnerships

We use the equity method to account for investments in joint ventures and partnerships that qualify as variable interest entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and entities that we do not control or where we do not own a majority of the economic interest but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Throughout these financial statements we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100% ownership interest. The Company also uses the equity method when we function as the managing partner and our venture partner has substantive participating rights or where we can be replaced by our venture partner as managing partner without cause. For a joint venture or partnership accounted for under the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses is reflected as income/loss when earned/incurred and distributions are credited against our investment in the joint venture or partnership as received.

In determining whether a joint venture or partnership is a variable interest entity, the Company considers: the form of our ownership interest and legal structure; the size of our investment; the financing structure of the entity, including necessity of subordinated debt; estimates of future cash flows; ours and our partner’s ability to participate in the decision making related to acquisitions, disposition, budgeting and financing of the entity; obligation to absorb losses and preferential returns; nature of our partner’s primary operations; and the degree, if any, of disproportionality between the economic and voting interests of the entity. As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company did not determine any of our joint ventures or partnerships to be variable interest entities.

We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for events or changes in circumstances that indicate there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, the fair value of the property of the joint venture, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. The amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. If we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. The aforementioned factors are taken into consideration as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our equity method investments. Should the actual results differ from management’s judgment, the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

UDR, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability and measured quarterly at their fair value. The changes in fair value for cash flow hedges that are deemed effective are reflected in other comprehensive income/(loss) and for non-designated derivative financial instruments in earnings. The ineffective component of cash flow hedges, if any, is recorded in earnings.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the Operating Partnership

Interests in the Operating Partnership held by limited partners are represented by Operating Partnership units (“OP Units”). The income is allocated to holders of OP Units based upon net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of OP Units outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units outstanding during the period. Capital contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to noncontrolling interests in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement.

Limited partners have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount as defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership (the “Operating Partnership Agreement”), provided that such OP Units have been outstanding for at least one year. UDR, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of Common Stock of the Company for each OP Unit), as defined in the Operating Partnership Agreement. Accordingly, the Company records the OP Units outside of permanent equity and reports the OP Units at their redemption value using the Company’s stock price at each balance sheet date.

Income Taxes

Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations for the operating properties, no provision for federal income taxes has been provided for at UDR. Historically, the Company has generally incurred only state and local excise and franchise taxes. UDR has elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”), primarily those engaged in development activities.

Income taxes for our TRS, RE


, are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date. The Company’s deferred tax assets are generally the result of differing depreciable lives on capitalized assets and timing of expense recognition for certain accrued liabilities. As of

December 31, 2013

, UDR recorded a net income tax receivable of

$1.3 million

and a net deferred tax asset of

$32.3 million

(net of a valuation allowance of

$1.3 million

), which are classified in

Other Assets

on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Prior to 2012, RE


had a history of losses and, as a result, historically recognized a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets.  Each quarter, the Company evaluates the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. In 2012, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, including any remaining net operating loss carry forward, would be realized.  In making this determination, the Company analyzed, among other things, its recent history of earnings from sales of depreciable property, forecasts of future earnings and its cumulative earnings for the last twelve quarters. The reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an income tax benefit of

$44.4 million

during the

year ended

December 31, 2012

,

$21.5 million

of which is reported in continuing operations and included within

Tax Benefit, Net

in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and

$22.9 million

of which is included within

Income/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

GAAP defines a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition.

The Company recognizes its tax positions and evaluates them using a two-step process. First, UDR determines whether a tax position is more likely than

not (greater than 50 percent probability)

to be sustained upon examination, including resolution

F -  15

UDR, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

UDR had

no

material unrecognized tax benefit, accrued interest or penalties at

December 31, 2013

. UDR and its subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of various state and local jurisdictions. The tax years

2010 through 2012

remain open to examination by tax jurisdictions to which we are subject. When applicable, UDR recognizes interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Discontinued Operations

Under GAAP, the results of operations for those properties sold during the year or classified as held for sale at the end of the current year are classified as discontinued operations in the current and prior periods. Further, to meet the discontinued operations criteria, the Company will not have any significant continuing involvement in the ownership or operation of the property after the sale or disposition. Once a property is classified as held for sale, depreciation is no longer recorded. However, if the Company determines that the property no longer meets the criteria for held for sale, the Company will recapture any unrecorded depreciation on the property. The assets and liabilities, if any, of properties classified as held for sale are presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value less the costs to sell the assets. (See Note 4,

Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale,

for further discussion).

Stock-Based Employee Compensation Plans

The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the award’s fair value on the grant date and recognizes the cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value for stock options issued by the Company is calculated utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton formula. For performance based awards, the Company remeasures the fair value each balance sheet date with adjustments made on a cumulative basis until the award is settled and the final compensation is known. The fair value for market based awards issued by the Company is calculated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation. For further discussion, see Note 9,

Employee Benefit Plans.

Advertising Costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item

General and

Administrative

. During the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


, total advertising expense was

$5.7 million

,

$6.2 million

, and

$5.4 million

, respectively.

Cost of Raising Capital

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of equity securities are deducted from stockholders’ equity. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance or renewal of debt are recorded based on the terms of the debt issuance or renewal. Accordingly, if the terms of the renewed or modified debt instrument are deemed to be substantially different (i.e. a 10 percent or greater difference in the cash flows between instruments), all unamortized financing costs associated with the extinguished debt are charged to earnings in the current period and certain costs of new debt issuances are capitalized and amortized over the term of the debt. When the cash flows are not substantially different, the lender costs associated with the renewal or modification are capitalized and amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt instrument and other related costs are expensed. The balance of any unamortized financing costs associated with retired debt is expensed upon retirement. Deferred financing costs for new debt instruments include fees and costs incurred by the Company to obtain financing. Deferred financing costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over a period not to exceed the term of the related debt.

Preferred Share Redemption and Repurchases

During the

year ended

December 31, 2012, the Company completed the redemption of all outstanding shares of its

6.75%

Use of Estimates

The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid could differ from those estimates.

Market Concentration Risk

The Company is subject to increased exposure from economic and other competitive factors specific to markets where the Company holds a significant percentage of the carrying value of its real estate portfolio. At

4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

The results of operations for properties sold during the year or designated as held for sale at the end of the year are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Properties classified as real estate held for sale generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months. The presentation of discontinued operations does not have an impact on net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders, and results in the reclassification of the operating results of all properties sold or classified as held for sale through

December 31, 2013

, within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the

years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

5. JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS

UDR has entered into joint ventures and partnerships with unrelated third parties to acquire real estate assets that are either consolidated and included in

Real Estate Owned

on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and are included in

Investment in and Advances to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, Net

on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company consolidates an entity in which we own

less than 100%

but control the joint venture or partnership as well as any variable interest entity where we are the primary beneficiary. In addition, the Company consolidates any joint venture or partnership in which we are the general partner or managing partner and the third party does not have the ability to substantively participate in the decision-making process nor the ability to remove us as general partner or managing partner without cause.

UDR’s joint ventures and partnerships are funded with a combination of debt and equity. Our losses are limited to our investment and except as noted below, the Company does not guarantee any debt, capital payout or other obligations associated with our joint ventures and partnerships.

Consolidated Joint Ventures

In December 2013, the Company consolidated its

95%

/

5%

development joint ventures 13

th

and Market in San Diego, CA and Domain College Park in Metropolitan, D.C. The consolidation was due to the Company becoming the managing partner of each of the joint ventures pursuant to amendments to the LLC Agreements. In connection with the amendments, our partner received equity distributions reducing its capital account balances to

zero

, the Company replaced our partner as the managing partner, and our partner no longer has the ability to substantively participate in the decision-making process, with only protective rights remaining. We accounted for the consolidations as asset acquisitions since the joint ventures were under development and not complete at the time of consolidation resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increasing our real estate owned by

$129.4 million

and our debt owed by

$63.6 million

. In addition pursuant to the amendments, the Company paid a non-refundable deposit to our partner in January 2014 of

$2.0 million

for each joint venture, or

$4.0 million

in total, for the right to exercise options in 2014 to acquire our partner’s upside participation in the joint ventures. The non-refundable deposits will be applied towards the future purchase price, which will be equivalent to our partner’s right to receive certain upside participation from the developments.

In May 2012, the Company formed a joint venture with an unaffiliated third party to acquire Pier 4 (land for future development) in Boston, Massachusetts. At closing, UDR owned a

98.0%

interest in the joint venture. The Company’s total investment of

apartment home community in Huntington Beach, California. At closing, the Company contributed

$9.0 million

and owned a

controlling interest in the investment. Under the terms of the operating agreement, our partner was required to achieve certain criteria as it relates to the entitlement process. If the criteria were met on or before 730 days after the site plan application was deemed complete by the City of Huntington Beach, the Company was obligated to contribute an additional

$3.0 million

to the joint venture for distribution to our partner. At the acquisition date, the Company accrued and capitalized

$3.0 million

related to the contingent consideration, which represented the difference between fair value of the property of

$9.8 million

on the formation date and the estimated fair value of the underlying property upon completion of the entitlement process of

$12.8 million

. The Company estimated the fair value based on Level 3 inputs utilized in a third party valuation. In 2012, the Company paid the joint venture partner a total of

$4.1 million

for its

10%

noncontrolling interest and settlement of the contingent consideration.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Partnerships

The Company recognizes earnings or losses from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships consisting of our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the joint ventures and partnerships.

Our secured debt instruments generally feature either monthly interest and principal or monthly interest-only payments with balloon payments due at maturity. For purposes of classification of the above table, variable rate debt with a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is deemed as fixed rate debt due to the Company having effectively established a fixed interest rate for the underlying debt instrument. As of

December 31, 2013

, secured debt encumbered

$2.3 billion

or

28.2%

of UDR’s total real estate owned based upon gross book value (

$5.9 billion

or

71.8%

of UDR’s real estate owned based on gross book value is unencumbered).

(a) At

December 31, 2013

, fixed rate mortgage notes payable are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest and mature at various dates from

December 2014

through

May 2019

and carry interest rates ranging from

3.43%

to

5.94%

.

The Company will from time to time acquire properties subject to fixed rate debt instruments. In those situations, management will record the secured debt at its estimated fair value and amortize any difference between the fair value and par to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument. During the

years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

, the Company had

$5.1 million

,

$4.9 million

, and

$3.5 million

of amortization expense on the fair market adjustment of debt assumed in acquisition of properties, respectively, which was included in

Interest Expense

4.99%

and the remaining balance of

$211.4 million

on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable interest rate of

1.61%

.

On June 28, 2013, the Company refinanced

$186 million

; and

•

Converted

76,291

OP Units into Company common stock.

Distributions are subject to the approval of the Board of Directors and are dependent upon our strategy, financial condition and operating results. UDR’s common distributions for the

years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

totaled

$0.94

,

$0.88

December 31, 2013

, the Internal Revenues Service (“IRS”) allowed REITs to distribute up to

90%

of total distributions in common shares with the residual distributed in cash as a means of enhancing liquidity.

Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series E”) has no stated par value and a liquidation preference of

$16.61

per share. Subject to certain adjustments and conditions, each share of the Series E is convertible at any time and from time to time at the holder’s option into one share of our common stock prior to a “Special Dividend” declared in 2008 (

$1.083

shares after the Special Dividend). The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for the election of directors or for any other purpose on which the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or any mandatory redemption.

Distributions declared on the Series E for the

years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

were

$1.33

per share. The Series E is not listed on any exchange. At

December 31, 2013

2,803,812

shares of the Series E were outstanding.

UDR is authorized to issue up to

20,000,000

shares of the Series F Preferred Stock (“Series F”). The Series F may be purchased by holders of UDR’s operating partnership units, or OP Units, at a purchase price of

$0.0001

per share. OP Unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and purchase one share of UDR’s Series F for each OP Unit held. At

Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

UDR’s Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows common and preferred stockholders the opportunity to purchase, through the reinvestment of cash dividends, additional shares of UDR’s common stock. From inception through December 31, 2008, shareholders have elected to utilize the Stock Purchase Plan to reinvest their distribution for the equivalent of

9,957,233

shares of Company common stock. Shares in the amount of

10,963,730

were reserved for issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan as of

December 31, 2013

. During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, UDR acquired all shares issued through the open market.

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

In May 2001, the stockholders of UDR approved the long term incentive plan (“LTIP”), which supersedes the 1985 Stock Option Plan. The LTIP authorizes the granting of awards which may take the form of options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards, and any other right or interest relating to common stock or cash incentive awards to Company directors, employees and outside trustees to promote the success of the Company by linking individual’s compensation via grants of share based payment. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the stockholders of UDR voted to amend and restate the LTIP to increase the number of shares reserved from

4,000,000

shares to

16,000,000

shares on an unadjusted basis for issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards under the LTIP, which all can be for incentive stock option grants. The LTIP generally provides, among other things, that options are granted at exercise prices not lower than the market value of the shares on the date of grant and that options granted must be exercised within


years. As of

December 31, 2013

, there were

7,928,182

common shares available for issuance under the LTIP.

The LTIP contains change of control provisions allowing for the immediate vesting of an award upon certain events such as a merger where UDR is not the surviving entity. Upon the death or disability of an award recipient all outstanding instruments will vest and all restrictions will lapse. Unless otherwise specified in the agreement, upon the retirement of an award recipient, all outstanding instruments will vest and all restrictions will lapse. The LTIP specifies that in the event of a capital transaction, which includes but is not limited to stock dividends, stock splits, extraordinary cash dividends and spin-offs, the number of shares available for grant in totality or to a single individual is to be adjusted proportionately. The LTIP specifies that when a capital transaction occurs that would dilute the holder of the stock award, prior grants are to be adjusted such that the recipient is no worse as a result of the capital transaction.

A summary of UDR’s stock option and restricted stock activities during the year ended

December 31, 2013

is as follows:

As of December 31, 2013, the Company had issued

3,632,305

Restricted Stock Awards

Restricted stock awards are granted to Company employees, officers, and directors. The restricted stock awards are valued based upon the closing sales price of UDR common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recorded under the straight-line method over the vesting period, which is generally

three

to

four

years. Restricted stock awards earn dividends payable in cash. Some of the restricted stock grants are based on the Company’s performance and are subject to adjustment during the initial one year performance period. For the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and


, we recognized

$3.6 million

,

$3.7 million

$4.2 million

of compensation expense related to the amortization of restricted stock awards, respectively.  The total remaining compensation cost on unvested restricted stock awards was

$3.4 million

and has a weighted average remaining contractual life of

1.5 years

as of

December 31, 2013

.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation

In February 2013, certain officers of the Company were awarded a restricted stock grant under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Program (“2013 LTI”). Fifty percent of the 2013 LTI award is based upon FFO and fifty percent is based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) as measured relative to comparable apartment REITs. The actual amount that vests was determined in February 2014 based upon the actual achievement of the metrics. Each award vests pro rata over three years commencing with the establishment of the award and continuing for two years following determination of the amount of the award at the end of the annual performance period. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon FFO was valued based upon the closing sales price of UDR common stock on the date of grant. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon TSR was valued at

$21.97

per share on the grant date as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a volatility factor of

15.8%

.  Compensation expense is recorded under the accelerated method over the vesting period. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized

$5.9 million

of compensation expense related to the amortization of 2013 LTI awards. The total remaining compensation cost on unvested 2013 LTI awards was

$5.3 million

and has a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately

2 years

as of December 31, 2013.

During 2010, certain officers of the Company were awarded a restricted stock grant under the 2010-2012 Long-Term Incentive Program (“2010-2012 LTI”). The actual amount of the awards that vested in 2012 was determined based upon the Company’s achievement of the specified performance metrics during the three-year performance period. The grants were valued on the grant date based upon the market price of UDR common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense was recorded pro rata over the three-year performance period. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we recognized

$4.9 million

and

$4.5 million

of compensation expense related to the amortization of the awards, respectively.

Profit Sharing Plan

Our profit sharing plan (the “Plan”) is a defined contribution plan covering all eligible full-time employees. Under the Plan, UDR makes discretionary profit sharing and matching contributions to the Plan as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

For income tax purposes, distributions paid to common stockholders may consist of ordinary income, qualified dividends, capital gains, unrecaptured section 1250 gains, return of capital, or a combination thereof. Distributions that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits constitute a return of capital rather than taxable income and reduce the stockholder’s basis in their common shares. To the extent that a distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder’s basis in the common shares, it generally will be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder’s common shares. Taxable distributions paid per common share were taxable as follows for the years ended

GAAP defines a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of income tax positions presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the tax position and all relevant facts, but without considering time values. GAAP also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition.

The Company evaluates our tax position using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than

not (greater than 50 percent probability)

to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company will then determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal, state and local income tax examination by tax authorities for years prior to 2009. The tax years 2009 through 2012 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.

11. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the Operating Partnership

Interests in the Operating Partnership held by limited partners are represented by OP Units. The income is allocated to holders of OP Units based upon net income attributable to common stockholders and the weighted average number of OP Units outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units outstanding during the period. Capital contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to noncontrolling interests in accordance with the terms of the individual partnership agreements.

Limited partners have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount as defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership (the “Operating Partnership Agreement”), provided that such OP Units have been outstanding for at least one year. UDR, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of common stock of the Company for each OP Unit), as defined in the Operating Partnership Agreement. Accordingly, the Company records the OP Units outside of permanent equity and reports the OP Units at their redemption value using the Company’s stock price at each balance sheet date.

12. FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are described below:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value

The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate options are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities.

The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of

December 31, 2013

and


, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In conjunction with the FASB’s fair value measurement guidance, the Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership have a redemption feature and are marked to their redemption value. The redemption value is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the redemption date, and therefore, is calculated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the balance sheet date. Since the valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership are classified as Level 2.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

At

December 31, 2013

, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaids, real estate taxes payable, accrued interest payable, security deposits and prepaid rent, distributions payable and accounts payable approximated their carrying values because of the short term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair values of other financial instruments were determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize on the disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

We estimate the fair value of our notes receivable and debt instruments by discounting the remaining cash flows of the debt instrument at a discount rate equal to the replacement market credit spread plus the corresponding treasury yields. Factors considered in determining a replacement market credit spread include general market conditions, borrower specific credit spreads, time remaining to maturity, loan-to-value ratios and collateral quality, where applicable (Level 3).

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value. Our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based upon Level 3 inputs such as industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, net is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. Based on the significance of the unobservable inputs, we classify these fair value measurements within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company did not incur any other-than-temporary decrease in the value of its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures during the

years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012

, respectively.

After determining an other-than-temporary decrease in the value of an equity method investment has occurred, we estimate the fair value of our investment by estimating the proceeds we would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation of the investment at the date of measurement. Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the investment giving consideration to the terms of the joint venture agreement and the estimated discounted future cash flows to be generated from the underlying joint venture assets. The inputs and assumptions utilized to estimate the future cash flows of the underlying assets are based upon the Company’s evaluation of the economy, market trends, operating results, and other factors, including judgments regarding costs to complete any construction activities, lease up and occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation rates, capitalization rates utilized to estimate the projected cash flows at the disposition, and discount rates.

13. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s investments and borrowings.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up front premium.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss), Net

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the

years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the

years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

, the Company recorded

less than a  $1,000

loss from ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to reset date and index mismatches between the derivative and the hedged item, and the fair value of interest rate swaps that were not zero at inception of the hedging relationship. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company reclassified a

$58,000

loss from Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) to earnings due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring, which was the result of the sale of an operating apartment community.

Amounts reported in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss), Net

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. Through

December 31, 2014

, the Company estimates that an additional

$4.4 million

will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features

The Company has agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations; or (2) the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the Company’s default on the indebtedness.

Certain of the Company’s agreements with its derivative counterparties contain provisions where if there is a change in the Company’s financial condition that materially changes the Company’s creditworthiness in an adverse manner, the Company may be required to fully collateralize its obligations under the derivative instrument. At December 31, 2013 and 2012,

no

cash collateral was posted or required to be posted by the Company or by a counterparty.

The Company also has an agreement with a derivative counterparty that incorporates the loan and financial covenant provisions of the Company’s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with these covenant provisions would result in the Company being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement.

The Company has certain agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, in the event of default by the Company or the counterparty, the right of setoff may be exercised. Any amount payable to one party by the other party may be reduced by its setoff against any amounts payable by the other party. Events that give rise to default by either party may include, but are not limited to, the failure to pay or deliver payment under the derivative contract, the failure to

comply with or perform under the derivative agreement, bankruptcy, a merger without assumption of the derivative agreement, or in a merger, a surviving entity's creditworthiness is materially weaker than the original party to the derivative agreement.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was

Litigation and Legal Matters

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company cannot determine the ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and claims at this time. The Company believes that such liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

15. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

GAAP guidance requires that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker to decide how to allocate resources and for purposes of assessing such segments’ performance. UDR’s chief operating decision maker is comprised of several members of its executive management team who use several generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance of the business for our reportable operating segments.

UDR owns and operates multifamily apartment communities that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment homes to a diverse base of tenants. The primary financial measures for UDR’s apartment communities are rental income and net operating income (“NOI”). Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. NOI is defined as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing.  Excluded from NOI is property management expense which is calculated as

2.75%

of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations, and land rent. UDR’s chief operating decision maker utilizes NOI as the key measure of segment profit or loss.

UDR’s

two

reportable segments are

Same-Store Communities

and

Non-Mature Communities/Other

:

•

Same-Store Communities

represent those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2012

and held as of

December 31, 2013

. A comparison of operating results from the prior year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not held for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves

90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months

.

•

Non-Mature Communities/Other

represent those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011, 2012, or 2013, sold properties, redevelopment properties, consolidated joint venture properties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.

Management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities on a same-store community and non-mature community/other basis, as well as individually and geographically. This is consistent with the aggregation criteria under GAAP as each of our apartment communities generally has similar economic characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore, the Company’s reportable segments have been aggregated by geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to the chief operating decision maker.

All revenues are from external customers and

no

single tenant or related group of tenants contributed 10% or more of UDR’s total revenues during the

years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Partners

United Dominion Realty, L.P.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the “Partnership”) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), changes in capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United Dominion Realty, L.P. at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein.

1. CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

United Dominion Realty, L.P. (“UDR, L.P.,” the “Operating Partnership,” “we” or “our”) is a Delaware limited partnership, that owns, acquires, renovates, redevelops, manages, and disposes of multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier to entry markets located in the United States. The high barrier to entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive single-family home prices and significant employment growth potential. UDR, L.P. is a subsidiary of UDR, Inc. (“UDR” or the “General Partner”), a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, through which UDR conducts a significant portion of its business. During the

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-10,

Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.

The objective of this update is to provide enhanced disclosures that will enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position. This included the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with an entity’s recognized assets and recognized liabilities within the scope of this update. The amendments require enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either 1) offset on the balance sheet in accordance with the “Offsetting Guidance” in ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45 (collectively, the offsetting guidance) or 2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, regardless of whether they are offset in accordance with the “Offsetting Guidance”. The amendments, which were adopted by the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2013, impacted the Operating Partnership’s disclosures related to its derivative activities. (See Note 8,

Derivatives and Hedging Activity

.) The new guidance did not have any impact on the Operating Partnership’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In February 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02

, Other Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)

to require preparers to report, in one place, information about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). For significant items reclassified out of AOCI to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period, reporting (either on the

F -  59

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes thereto) is required about the effect of the reclassifications on the respective line items in the statement where net income is presented. For items that are not reclassified to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period, a cross reference to other existing disclosures is required in the notes. The amendments, which were adopted by the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2013, did not have any impact on the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the required disclosures in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income/(Loss) or in the notes thereto for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.

Real Estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and other costs incurred during their development, acquisition and redevelopment.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition and/or improvement of real estate assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the expenditures qualify as a betterment or the life of the related asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life expectancy.

The Operating Partnership purchases real estate investment properties and records the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair value. The primary, although not only, identifiable intangible asset associated with our portfolio is the value of existing lease agreements. When recording the acquisition of a community, we first assign fair value to the estimated intangible value of the existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the land, building and fixtures assuming the community is vacant. The Operating Partnership estimates the intangible value of the lease agreements by determining the lost revenue associated with a hypothetical lease-up. Depreciation on the building is based on the expected useful life of the asset and the in-place leases are amortized over their remaining average contractual life. Property acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

Quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant, the Operating Partnership will assess our real estate properties for indicators of impairment. In determining whether the Operating Partnership has indicators of impairment in our real estate assets, we assess whether the long-lived asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s undiscounted future cash flows, which is representative of projected net operating income (“NOI”) plus the residual value of the community. Our future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. If such indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties classified as real estate held for sale generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months. Real estate held for sale is carried at the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less the cost to sell, determined on an asset-by-asset basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for sale properties are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to held for sale properties are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for sale.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which are

35 to 55 years

for buildings,

10 to 35 years

for major improvements, and

3 to 10 years

for furniture, fixtures, equipment, and other assets. As of

December 31, 2013

and


, the amount of our net intangible assets which are reflected in

Other Asset

s was

$7.6 million

and

$9.3 million

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2013

and


, the amount of our net intangible liabilities which are reflected in

Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Other Liabilities

was

$3.5 million

and

$3.9 million

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balances are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective intangible.

Predevelopment, development, and redevelopment projects and related costs are capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as

Total Real Estate Owned, Net of Accumulated Depreciation

. The Operating Partnership capitalizes costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to

F -  60

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. These costs, excluding the direct costs of development and redevelopment and capitalized interest, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 were

$2.5 million

,

$2.1 million

, and

$2.2 million

, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, total interest capitalized was

$5.9 million

,

$3.7 million

,

$1.8 million

, respectively. As each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Company ceases capitalization on the related portion and depreciation commences over the estimated useful life.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short-term, highly liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The majority of the Operating Partnership’s cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and security deposits.

Revenue and Real Estate Sales Gain Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents and tenants in accordance with GAAP. Rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis and recognized when earned. The Operating Partnership recognizes interest income, management and other fees and incentives when earned, fixed and determinable.

For sale transactions meeting the requirements for full accrual profit recognition, we remove the related assets and liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes. For sale transactions that do not meet the full accrual sale criteria due to our continuing involvement, we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement and account for the transaction under an alternate method of accounting. Unless certain limited criteria are met, non-monetary transactions, including property exchanges, are accounted for at fair value.

Sales to entities in which we or our General Partner retain or otherwise own an interest are accounted for as partial sales. If all other requirements for recognizing profit under the full accrual method have been satisfied and no other forms of continuing involvement are present, we recognize profit proportionate to the outside interest in the buyer and defer the gain on the interest we or our General Partner retain. The Operating Partnership recognizes any deferred gain when the property is sold to a third party. In transactions accounted by us as partial sales, we determine if the buyer of the majority equity interest in the venture was provided a preference as to cash flows in either an operating or a capital waterfall. If a cash flow preference has been provided, we recognize profit only to the extent that proceeds from the sale of the majority equity interest exceed costs related to the entire property.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The General Partner utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. Derivative financial instruments associated with the Operating Partnership’s allocation of the General Partner’s debt are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability and measured quarterly at their fair value. The changes in fair value for the General Partner’s cash flow hedges allocated to the Operating Partnership that are deemed effective are reflected in other comprehensive income and for non-designated derivative financial instruments in earnings. The ineffective component of cash flow hedges, if any, is recorded in earnings.

Noncontrolling Interests

The noncontrolling interests represent the General Partner’s interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries and are presented in the capital section of the consolidated balance sheets since these interests are not convertible or redeemable into any other ownership interests of the Operating Partnership.

F -  61

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Operating Partnership corrected an error in the General Partner’s ownership interest in one of the consolidated subsidiaries. The correction increased the General Partner’s ownership interest resulting in a cumulative adjustment increasing

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

by

$3.3 million

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations with a corresponding increase to

Noncontrolling Interests

on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes the impact of the cumulative adjustment in 2013 is immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole.

Income Taxes

The taxable income or loss of the Operating Partnership is reported on the tax returns of the partners. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements for federal or state income taxes on income that is passed through to the partners. However, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the Operating Partnership are recorded at the entity level. The Operating Partnership’s tax returns are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. Net income for financial reporting purposes differs from the net income for income tax reporting purposes primarily due to temporary differences, principally real estate depreciation and the tax deferral of certain gains on property sales. The differences in depreciation result from differences in the book and tax basis of certain real estate assets and the differences in the methods of depreciation and lives of the real estate assets.

The Operating Partnership follows the accounting guidance within GAAP, with respect to how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the financial statements. The guidance requires the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Operating Partnership’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Management of the Operating Partnership is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. The Operating Partnership has no examinations in progress and none are expected at this time.

Management of the Operating Partnership has reviewed all open tax years (2010 through 2012) and major jurisdictions, and concluded there is

no

tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in future tax returns.

Discontinued Operations

Under GAAP, the results of operations for those properties sold during the year or classified as held for sale at the end of the current year are classified as discontinued operations in the current and prior periods. Further, to meet the discontinued operations criteria, the Operating Partnership or related parties will not have any significant continuing involvement in the ownership or operation of the property after the sale or disposition. Once a property is classified as held for sale, depreciation is no longer recorded. However, if the Operating Partnership determines that the property no longer meets the criteria for held for sale, the Operating Partnership will recapture any unrecorded depreciation on the property. The assets and liabilities, if any, of properties classified as held for sale are presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value less the costs to sell the assets. (See Note 4,

Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale,

for further discussion).

Allocation of General and Administrative Expenses

The Operating Partnership is charged directly for general and administrative expenses it incurs. The Operating Partnership is also charged with other general and administrative expenses that have been allocated by the General Partner to each of its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, based on each subsidiary’s pro-rata portion of UDR’s total apartment homes. (See Note 6,

Use of Estimates

The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid could differ from those estimates.

4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

The results of operations for properties sold during the year or designated as held for sale at the end of the year are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Properties classified as real estate held for sale generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months. The presentation of discontinued operations does not have an impact on net income/(loss) attributable to OP unitholders, and results in the reclassification of the operating results of all properties sold or classified as held for sale through

5. DEBT

Our secured debt instruments generally feature either monthly interest and principal or monthly interest-only payments with balloon payments due at maturity. For purposes of classification in the following table, variable rate debt with a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is deemed as fixed rate debt due to the Operating Partnership having effectively established the fixed interest rate for the underlying debt instrument. Secured debt consists of the following as of

7. FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are described below:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

The estimated fair values of the Operating Partnership’s financial instruments either recorded or disclosed on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2013

and


are summarized as follows

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

There were no transfers into or out of each of the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value

The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate options are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities.

The Operating Partnership incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Operating Partnership has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

Although the Operating Partnership has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of

December 31, 2013

and

December 31, 2012

, the Operating Partnership has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Operating Partnership has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In conjunction with the FASB’s fair value measurement guidance, the Operating Partnership made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

At

December 31, 2013

, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaids, real estate taxes payable, accrued interest payable, security deposits and prepaid rent, distributions payable and accounts payable approximated their carrying values because of the short term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair values of other financial instruments were determined by the Operating Partnership using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Operating Partnership would realize on the disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The General Partner estimates the fair value of our debt instruments by discounting the remaining cash flows of the debt instrument at a discount rate equal to the replacement market credit spread plus the corresponding treasury yields. Factors considered in determining a replacement market credit spread include general market conditions, borrower specific credit spreads, time remaining to maturity, loan-to-value ratios and collateral quality (Level 3).

The Operating Partnership records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. Cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect management’s best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value. The General Partner’s estimates of fair value represent management’s estimates based upon Level 3 inputs such as industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

8. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Operating Partnership is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The General Partner principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management

F -  69

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

of its core business activities. The General Partner manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the General Partner enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The General Partner’s and the Operating Partnership’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the General Partner’s known or expected cash payments principally related to the General Partner’s borrowings.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The General Partner’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the General Partner primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the General Partner making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up front premium.

A portion of the General Partner’s interest rate derivatives have been allocated to the Operating Partnership based on the General Partner’s underlying debt instruments allocated to the Operating Partnership. (See Note 5,

Debt.

)

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, Net

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the

years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the

years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

, the Operating Partnership recorded

less than $1,000

of ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to reset date and index mismatches between the derivative and the hedged item.

Amounts reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, Net related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the General Partner’s variable-rate debt that is allocated to the Operating Partnership. During the next twelve months through

December 31, 2014

, we estimate that an additional

$2.2 million

will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the Operating Partnership had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (

dollars in thousands

):

Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company’s exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of GAAP. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings and resulted in losses of

$9,000

,

$9,000

, and

$204,000

for the

years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features

The General Partner has agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if the General Partner defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the General Partner could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations; or (2) the General Partner could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the General Partner’s default on the indebtedness.

Certain of the General Partner’s agreements with its derivative counterparties contain provisions where if there is a change in the General Partner’s financial condition that materially changes the General Partner’s creditworthiness in an adverse manner, the General Partner may be required to fully collateralize its obligations under the derivative instrument. At December 31, 2013 and 2012,

no

cash collateral was posted or required to be posted by the General Partner or by a counterparty.

The General Partner also has an agreement with a derivative counterparty that incorporates the loan and financial covenant provisions of the General Partner’s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with these covenant provisions would result in the General Partner being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position that were allocated to the Operating Partnership, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was

$2.9 million

. If the General Partner had breached any of these provisions at

9. CAPITAL STRUCTURE

General Partnership Units

The General Partner has complete discretion to manage and control the operations and business of the Operating Partnership, which includes but is not limited to the acquisition and disposition of real property, construction of buildings and making capital improvements, and the borrowing of funds from outside lenders or UDR and its subsidiaries to finance such activities. The General Partner can generally authorize, issue, sell, redeem or purchase any OP Unit or securities of the Operating Partnership without the approval of the limited partners. The General Partner can also approve, with regard to the issuances of OP Units, the class or one or more series of classes, with designations, preferences, participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties including rights, powers and duties senior to limited partnership interests without approval of any limited partners except holders of Class A Partnership Units. There were

OP Units outstanding were held by non-affiliated partners at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively, of which

1,751,671

were Class A Limited Partnership Units.

Subject to the Operating Partnership Agreement, the limited partners have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the Operating Partnership Agreement), provided that such OP Units have been outstanding for at least

one

year. UDR, as general partner of the Operating Partnership, may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of common stock of UDR for each OP Unit), as defined in the Operating Partnership Agreement.

The non-affiliated limited partners’ capital is adjusted to redemption value at the end of each reporting period with the corresponding offset against UDR’s limited partner capital account based on the redemption rights noted above. The aggregate value upon redemption of the then-outstanding OP Units held by limited partners was

$217.6 million

and

$223.4 million

as of

December 31, 2013

and

December 31, 2012

, respectively, based on the value of UDR’s common stock at each period end. A limited partner has no right to receive any distributions from the Operating Partnership on or after the date of redemption of its OP Units.

Class A Limited Partnership Units

Class A Partnership Units have a cumulative, annual, non-compounded preferred return, which is equal to

8%

based on a value of

$16.61

per Class A Partnership Unit.

Holders of the Class A Partnership Units exclusively possess certain voting rights. The Operating Partnership may not do the following without approval of the holders of the Class A Partnership Units: (i) increase the authorized or issued amount of Class A Partnership Units, (ii) reclassify any other partnership interest into Class A Partnership Units, (iii) create, authorize or issue any obligations or security convertible into or the right to purchase any Class Partnership units, without the approval of the holders of the Class A Partnership Units, (iv) enter into a merger or acquisition, or (v) amend or modify the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership in a manner that adversely affects the relative rights, preferences or privileges of the Class A Partnership Units.

1,002,556

limited partnership units owned by UDR and affiliated entities, resulting in a capital reduction of

$23.3 million

.

Allocation of Profits and Losses

Profit of the Operating Partnership is allocated in the following order: (i) to the General Partner and the Limited Partners in proportion to and up to the amount of cash distributions made during the year, and (ii) to the General Partner and Limited Partners in accordance with their percentage interests. Losses and depreciation and amortization expenses, non-recourse liabilities are allocated to the General Partner and Limited Partners in accordance with their percentage interests. Losses allocated to the Limited Partners are capped to the extent that such an allocation would not cause a deficit in the Limited Partners capital account. Such losses are, therefore, allocated to the General Partner. If any Partner’s capital balance were to fall into a deficit any income and gains are allocated to each Partner sufficient to eliminate its negative capital balance.

10. INCOME/(LOSS) PER OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNIT

Basic income/(loss) per OP Unit is computed by dividing net income/(loss) attributable to general and limited partner unitholders by the weighted average number of general and limited partner units (including redeemable OP Units) outstanding during the year. Diluted income/(loss) per OP Unit reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue OP Units were exercised or converted into OP Units or resulted in the issuance of OP Units and then shared in the income/(loss) of the Operating Partnership. For the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


, and

no

dilutive instruments, and therefore, diluted income/(loss) per OP Unit and basic income/(loss) per OP Unit are the same. See Note 9,

Contingencies

Litigation and Legal Matters

The Operating Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Operating Partnership cannot determine the ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and claims at this time. The General Partner believes that such liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on the Operating Partnership’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

12. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

GAAP guidance requires that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker to decide how to allocate resources and for purposes of assessing such segments’ performance. The Operating Partnership has the same chief operating decision maker as that of its parent, the General Partner. The chief operating decision maker consists of several members of UDR’s executive management team who use several generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance of the business for our reportable operating segments.

The Operating Partnership owns and operates multifamily apartment communities throughout the United States that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment homes to a diverse base of tenants. The primary financial measures of the Operating Partnership’s apartment communities are rental income and net operating income (“NOI”), and are included in the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of UDR’s performance on a consolidated basis. Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. NOI is defined as total revenues less direct property operating expenses. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense, which is calculated as

2.75%

of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent. The chief operating decision maker of the General Partner utilizes NOI as the key measure of segment profit or loss.

The Operating Partnership’s

two

reportable segments are

Same-Store Communities

and

Non-Mature/Other

communities:

•

Same-Store Communities

represent those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2012

and held as of

December 31, 2013

. A comparison of operating results from the prior year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not held for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy

once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months

.

•

Non-Mature Communities/Other

represent those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011, 2012, or 2013, sold properties, redevelopment properties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.

Management of the General Partner evaluates the performance of each of the Operating Partnership's apartment communities on a same-store community and non-mature community/other basis, as well as individually and geographically. This is consistent with the aggregation criteria of Topic 280 as each of the apartment communities generally has similar economic characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore, the Operating Partnership’s reportable segments have been aggregated by geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to the chief operating decision maker.

$1.8 million

were related to rent concession rebates provided to residents during the period the properties were uninhabitable and were classified in

Hurricane-Related (Recoveries)/Charges, Net

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and

$400,000

UDR, INC., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”, which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the Principal Amount of THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($300,000,000), on the Stated Maturity Date specified above (or any Redemption Date or Repayment Date, each as defined on the reverse hereof, or any earlier date of acceleration of maturity) (each such date being hereinafter referred to as the “Maturity Date” with respect to the principal repayable on such date) and to pay interest thereon (and on any overdue principal, premium and/or interest to the extent legally enforceable) at the Interest Rate per annum specified above, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment.  The Company will pay interest in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, if any, specified above (each, an “Interest Payment Date”), commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date specified above, and on the Maturity Date;

provided

,

however

, that if the Original Issue Date occurs between a Record Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest payment will commence on the Interest Payment Date immediately following the next succeeding Record Date to the registered holder (the “Holder”) of this Note on the next succeeding Record Date.  Interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”) as primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Holder and to the Trustee and their successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at the Maturity Date, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under the Indenture whether for principal of or interest on the Notes (and premium and Make-Whole Amount, if applicable) and all other monetary obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes (all such obligations guaranteed hereby by the Operating Partnership being the “Guarantee”).  The Holder of this Note may enforce its rights under the Guarantee directly against the Operating Partnership without first making a demand or taking action against the Company or any other person or entity.  The Operating Partnership may, without the consent of the Holder of this Note, assume all of the Company’s rights and obligations under this Note and, upon such assumption, the Company will be released from its liabilities under the Indenture and this Note.

Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or duly provided for) to, but excluding, the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, an “Interest Period”).  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions described herein, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes, as defined on the reverse hereof) is registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day, as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (the “Record Date”);

provided

,

however

, that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be payable to the person to whom the principal hereof and premium, if any, hereon shall be payable.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date (“Defaulted Interest”) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the close of business on any Record Date and, instead, shall be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a special record date (the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided for in the Indenture.

Payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note due on the Maturity Date will be made in immediately available funds upon presentation and surrender of this Note (and, with respect to any applicable repayment of this Note, upon delivery of instructions as contemplated on the reverse hereof) at the office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, currently the corporate trust office of the Trustee located at 40 Broad Street, 5th Floor, New York, New York 10004, or at such other paying agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, as the Company may determine;

provided

,

however

, that if the Specified Currency (as defined below) is other than United States dollars and such payment is to be made in the Specified Currency in accordance with the provisions set forth below, such payment will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account with a bank designated by the Holder hereof at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, provided that such bank has appropriate facilities therefor and that this Note is presented and surrendered and, if applicable, instructions are delivered at the aforementioned office or agency maintained by the Company in time for the Trustee to make such payment in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures.  Payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date

will be made at the aforementioned office or agency maintained by the Company or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register maintained by the Trustee;

provided

,

however

, that a Holder of U.S.$10,000,000 (or, if the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) will be entitled to receive interest payments on such Interest Payment Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds if such Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 calendar days prior to such Interest Payment Date.  Any such wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by such Holder.

If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day.

As used herein, “Business Day” means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York; provided, however, that if the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, such day must also not be a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the

Principal Financial Center (as defined below)  of the country issuing the Specified Currency (or, if the Specified Currency is Euro, such day must also be a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open).  “Principal Financial Center” means the capital city of the country issuing the Specified Currency, except that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, South African rands and Swiss francs, the “Principal Financial Center” shall be The City of New York, Sydney, Toronto, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.

The Company is obligated to make payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note in the currency in which this Note is denominated above (or, if such currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in the country issuing such currency or, if such currency is Euro, in the member states of the European Union that have adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty on European Union, then the currency which is at the time of such payment legal tender in the related country or in the adopting member states of the European Union, as the case may be) (the “Specified Currency”).  If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, except as otherwise provided below, any such amounts so payable by the Company will be converted by the Exchange Rate Agent specified above into United States dollars for payment to the Holder of this Note.

Any United States dollar amount to be received by the Holder of this Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent) selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for United States dollars for settlement on such payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of Notes scheduled to receive United States dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder of this Note by deductions from such payments.  If three such bid quotations are not available, payments on this Note will be made in the Specified Currency.

If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal,

premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency by submitting a written request for such payment to the Trustee at its corporate trust office in The City of New York on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.  Such written request may be mailed or hand delivered or sent by cable, telex or other form of facsimile transmission.  The Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of all future payments in the Specified Currency in respect of such principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, and need not file a separate election for each payment.  Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice delivered to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.

If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars and the Holder of this Note shall have duly made an election to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency, but the Specified Currency is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Note by making such payment in United States dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the second Business Day prior to such payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate.  The “Market Exchange Rate” for the Specified Currency other than United States dollars means the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for the Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Any payment made in United States dollars under such circumstances shall not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture).

All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.

The Company agrees to indemnify the Holder of any Note against any loss incurred by such Holder as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against the Company for any amount due hereunder and such judgment or order requiring payment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than the Specified Currency, and as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the Specified Currency amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order, and (ii) the rate of exchange at which such Holder, on the date of payment of such judgment or order, is able to purchase the Specified Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by such Holder, as the case may be.  The foregoing indemnity constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the Company and continues in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid.  The term “rate of exchange” includes any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, the relevant currency.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof and, if so specified on the face hereof, in an Addendum hereto, which further provisions shall have the same force and effect as if set forth on the face hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or “Other/Additional Provisions” apply to this Note as specified above, this Note shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such “Other/Additional Provisions”.

Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, UDR, Inc. has caused this Note to be duly executed by one of its duly authorized officers.

UDR, INC.

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES A

DUE NINE MONTHS OR MORE FROM DATE OF ISSUE, FULLY AND

UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

(Fixed Rate)

This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities (the “Debt Securities”) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1995, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time (the “Indenture”), between the Company (successor by merger to UDR, Inc., a Virginia corporation) and U.S.  Bank National Association, successor trustee to Wachovia Bank, National Association, (formerly known as First Union National Bank of Virginia) as trustee (the “Trustee”, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is one of the series of Debt Securities designated as “Medium-Term Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue, Fully and Unconditionally Guaranteed by United Dominion Realty, L.P.” (the “Notes”).  All terms used but not defined in this Note or in an Addendum hereto shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture or on the face hereof, as the case may be.

United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”) as primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Holder and to the Trustee and their successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at the Maturity Date, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under the Indenture whether for principal of or interest on the Notes (and premium and Make-Whole Amount, if applicable) and all other monetary obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes (all such obligations guaranteed hereby by the Operating Partnership being the “Guarantee”).  The Holder of this Note may enforce its rights under the Guarantee directly against the Operating Partnership without first making a demand or taking action against the Company or any other person or entity.  The Operating Partnership may, without the consent of the Holder of this Note, assume all of the Company’s rights and obligations under this Note and, upon such assumption, the Company will be released from its liabilities under the Indenture and this Note.

This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S. $1,000 and integral multiples thereof or other Authorized Denomination specified on the face hereof.

This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the following two paragraphs, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date.

This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company on any date on or after the Initial Redemption Date, if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (the “Redemption Date”), on written notice given to the Holder hereof (in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture) not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date.  The “Redemption Price” shall be an amount equal to the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof) multiplied by the unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed.  The Initial Redemption Percentage, if any, shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be redeemed.  In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name  of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.

This Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (the “Repayment Date”).  For this Note to be repaid, the Trustee must receive at its corporate trust office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Repayment Date, such Note and instructions to such effect forwarded by the Holder hereof.  Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof shall be irrevocable.  In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.

If this Note is specified on the face hereof to be a Discount Note, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to the sum of (1) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) and, in the event of any redemption of this Note (if applicable), multiplied by the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if applicable) and (2) any unpaid interest accrued thereon to the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be.  The difference between the Issue Price and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as the “Discount”.

For purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be accrued so as to cause the yield on the Note to be constant.  The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period) and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated.  If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the “Initial Period”) is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued.  If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence.

The covenants set forth in Section 1004(a) and Section 1007 of the Indenture shall not apply to this Note, and the following covenants shall instead apply to this Note in place of the covenants set forth in Section 1004(a) and Section 1007 of the Indenture:

“The Trust will, and will cause the Subsidiaries to, have at all times Total Unencumbered Assets of not less than 150% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the Trust’s outstanding Unsecured Debt and the outstanding Unsecured Debt of the Subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP.

The Trust will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, incur any Debt if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such additional Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Debt  of the Trust and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis determined in accordance with GAAP is greater than 65% of the sum of (without duplication) (i) the Trust’s Total Assets as  of the end of the calendar quarter covered in the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, most recently filed with the Commission (or, if such filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act, with the Trustee) prior to the incurrence of such additional Debt and (ii) the purchase price of any real estate assets or mortgages receivable acquired, and the amount of any securities offering proceeds received (to the extent such proceeds were not used to acquire real estate assets or mortgages receivable or used to reduce Debt), by the Trust or any Subsidiary since the end of such calendar quarter, including those proceeds obtained in connection with the incurrence of such additional Debt.

‘Total Unencumbered Assets’ means the sum of, without duplication, those Undepreciated Real Estate Assets which are not subject to a lien securing Debt and all other assets, excluding accounts receivable and intangibles, of the Trust and the Subsidiaries not subject to a lien securing Debt, all determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP; provided, however, that all investments by the Trust and the Subsidiaries in unconsolidated joint ventures, unconsolidated limited partnerships, unconsolidated limited liability

companies and other unconsolidated entities shall be excluded from Total Unencumbered Assets to the extent that such investments would have otherwise been included.”

If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may, and in certain cases shall, be accelerated in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Notes or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification  of the rights and obligations  of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Securities at the time outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of all such Debt Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions  of the Indenture.  Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, in certain instances, to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and other Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange heretofore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note at the times, places and rate or formula, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal hereof and any premium or interest hereon are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes having the same terms and provisions, of Authorized Denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued by the Company to the designated transferee or transferees.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different Authorized Denominations but otherwise having the same terms and provisions, as requested by the Holder hereof surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary, except as required by law.

THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA.

“Comparable Treasury Issue” means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term from the redemption date to the maturity date of this Note that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Note.

United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”) as primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Holder and to the Trustee and their successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at the Maturity Date, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under the Indenture whether for principal of or interest on the Notes (and premium and Make-Whole Amount, if applicable) and all other monetary obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes (all such obligations guaranteed hereby by the Operating Partnership being the “Guarantee”).  The Holder of this Note may enforce its rights under the Guarantee directly against the Operating Partnership without first making a demand or taking action against the Company or any other person or entity.  The Operating Partnership may, without the consent of the Holder of this Note, assume all of the Company’s rights and obligations under this Note and, upon such assumption, the Company will be released from its liabilities under the Indenture and this Note.

Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or duly provided for) to, but excluding, the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, an “Interest Period”).  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions described herein, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes, as defined on the reverse hereof) is registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day, as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (the “Record Date”);

provided

,

however

, that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be payable to the person to whom the principal hereof and premium, if any, hereon shall be payable.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date (“Defaulted Interest”) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the close of business on any Record Date and, instead, shall be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a special record date (the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided for in the Indenture.

Payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note due on the Maturity Date will be made in immediately available funds upon presentation and surrender of this Note (and, with respect to any applicable repayment of this Note, upon delivery of instructions as contemplated on the reverse hereof) at the office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, currently the corporate trust office of the Trustee located at 40 Broad Street, 5th Floor, New York, New York 10004, or at such other paying agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, as the Company may determine;

provided

,

however

, that if the Specified Currency (as defined below) is other than United States dollars and such payment is to be made in the Specified Currency in accordance with the provisions set forth below, such payment will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account with a bank designated by the Holder hereof at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, provided that such bank has appropriate facilities therefor and that this Note is presented and surrendered and, if applicable, instructions are delivered at the aforementioned office or agency maintained by the Company in time for the Trustee to make such payment in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures.  Payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date

will be made at the aforementioned office or agency maintained by the Company or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register maintained by the Trustee;

provided

,

however

, that a Holder of U.S.$10,000,000 (or, if the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) will be entitled to receive interest payments on such Interest Payment Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds if such Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 calendar days prior to such Interest Payment Date.  Any such wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by such Holder.

If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day.

As used herein, “Business Day” means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York;

provided

,

however

, that if the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, such day must also not be a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the

Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing the Specified Currency (or, if the Specified Currency is Euro, such day must also be a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open).  “Principal Financial Center” means the capital city of the country issuing the Specified Currency, except that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, South African rands and Swiss francs, the “Principal Financial Center” shall be The City of New York, Sydney, Toronto, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.

The Company is obligated to make payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note in the currency in which this Note is denominated above (or, if such currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in the country issuing such currency or, if such currency is Euro, in the member states of the European Union that have adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty on European Union, then the currency which is at the time of such payment legal tender in the related country or in the adopting member states of the European Union, as the case may be) (the “Specified Currency”).  If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, except as otherwise provided below, any such amounts so payable by the Company will be converted by the Exchange Rate Agent specified above into United States dollars for payment to the Holder of this Note.

Any United States dollar amount to be received by the Holder of this Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent) selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for United States dollars for settlement on such payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of Notes scheduled to receive United States dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder of this Note by deductions from such payments.  If three such bid quotations are not available, payments on this Note will be made in the Specified Currency.

If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal,

premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency by submitting a written request for such payment to the Trustee at its corporate trust office in The City of New York on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.  Such written request may be mailed or hand delivered or sent by cable, telex or other form of facsimile transmission.  The Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of all future payments in the Specified Currency in respect of such principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, and need not file a separate election for each payment.  Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice delivered to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.

If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars and the Holder of this Note shall have duly made an election to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency, but the Specified Currency is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Note by making such payment in United States dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the second Business Day prior to such payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate.  The “Market Exchange Rate” for the Specified Currency other than United States dollars means the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for the Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Any payment made in United States dollars under such circumstances shall not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture).

All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.

The Company agrees to indemnify the Holder of any Note against any loss incurred by such Holder as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against the Company for any amount due hereunder and such judgment or order requiring payment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than the Specified Currency, and as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the Specified Currency amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order, and (ii) the rate of exchange at which such Holder, on the date of payment of such judgment or order, is able to purchase the Specified Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by such Holder, as the case may be.  The foregoing indemnity constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the Company and continues in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid.  The term “rate of exchange” includes any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, the relevant currency.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof and, if so specified on the face hereof, in an Addendum hereto, which further provisions shall have the same force and effect as if set forth on the face hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or “Other/Additional Provisions” apply to this Note as specified above, this Note shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such “Other/Additional Provisions”.

Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, UDR, Inc.  has caused this Note to be duly executed by one of its duly authorized officers.

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES A

DUE NINE MONTHS OR MORE FROM DATE OF ISSUE, FULLY AND

UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

(Fixed Rate)

This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities (the “Debt Securities”) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1995, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time (the “Indenture”), between the Company (successor by merger to UDR, Inc., a Virginia corporation) and U.S.  Bank National Association, successor trustee to Wachovia Bank, National Association, (formerly known as First Union National Bank of Virginia) as trustee (the “Trustee”, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is one of the series of Debt Securities designated as “Medium-Term Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue, Fully and Unconditionally Guaranteed by United Dominion Realty, L.P.” (the “Notes”).  All terms used but not defined in this Note or in an Addendum hereto shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture or on the face hereof, as the case may be.

United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”) as primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Holder and to the Trustee and their successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at the Maturity Date, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under the Indenture whether for principal of or interest on the Notes (and premium and Make-Whole Amount, if applicable) and all other monetary obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes (all such obligations guaranteed hereby by the Operating Partnership being the “Guarantee”).  The Holder of this Note may enforce its rights under the Guarantee directly against the Operating Partnership without first making a demand or taking action against the Company or any other person or entity.  The Operating Partnership may, without the consent of the Holder of this Note, assume all of the Company’s rights and obligations under this Note and, upon such assumption, the Company will be released from its liabilities under the Indenture and this Note.

This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S. $1,000 and integral multiples thereof or other Authorized Denomination specified on the face hereof.

This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the following two paragraphs, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date.

This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company on any date on or after the Initial Redemption Date, if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (the “Redemption Date”), on written notice given to the Holder hereof (in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture) not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date.  The “Redemption Price” shall be an amount equal to the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof) multiplied by the unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed.  The Initial Redemption Percentage, if any, shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be redeemed.  In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.

This Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (the “Repayment Date”).  For this Note to be repaid, the Trustee must receive at its corporate trust office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Repayment Date, such Note and instructions to such effect forwarded by the Holder hereof.  Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof shall be irrevocable.  In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.

If this Note is specified on the face hereof to be a Discount Note, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to the sum of (1) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) and, in the event of any redemption of this Note (if applicable), multiplied by the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if applicable) and (2) any unpaid interest accrued thereon to the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be.  The difference between the Issue Price and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as the “Discount”.

For purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be accrued so as to cause the yield on the Note to be constant.  The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period) and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated.  If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the “Initial Period”) is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued.  If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence.

The covenants set forth in Section 1004(a) and Section 1007 of the Indenture shall not apply to this Note, and the following covenants shall instead apply to this Note in place of the covenants set forth in Section 1004(a) and Section 1007 of the Indenture:

“The Trust will, and will cause the Subsidiaries to, have at all times Total Unencumbered Assets of not less than 150% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the Trust’s outstanding Unsecured Debt and the outstanding Unsecured Debt of the Subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP.

The Trust will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, incur any Debt if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such additional Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Debt of the Trust and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis determined in accordance with GAAP is greater than 65% of the sum of (without duplication) (i) the Trust’s Total Assets as of the end of the calendar quarter covered in the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, most recently filed with the Commission (or, if such filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act, with the Trustee) prior to the incurrence of such additional Debt and (ii) the purchase price of any real estate assets or mortgages receivable acquired, and the amount of any securities offering proceeds received (to the extent such proceeds were not used to acquire real estate assets or mortgages receivable or used to reduce Debt), by the Trust or any Subsidiary since the end of such calendar quarter, including those proceeds obtained in connection with the incurrence of such additional Debt.

‘Total Unencumbered Assets’ means the sum of, without duplication, those Undepreciated Real Estate Assets which are not subject to a lien securing Debt and all other assets, excluding accounts receivable and intangibles, of the Trust and the Subsidiaries not subject to a lien securing Debt, all determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP; provided, however, that all investments by the Trust and the Subsidiaries in unconsolidated joint ventures, unconsolidated limited partnerships, unconsolidated limited liability

companies and other unconsolidated entities shall be excluded from Total Unencumbered Assets to the extent that such investments would have otherwise been included.”

If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may, and in certain cases shall, be accelerated in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Notes or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Securities at the time outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of all such Debt Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture.  Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, in certain instances, to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and other Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange heretofore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note at the times, places and rate or formula, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal hereof and any premium or interest hereon are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes having the same terms and provisions, of Authorized Denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued by the Company to the designated transferee or transferees.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different Authorized Denominations but otherwise having the same terms and provisions, as requested by the Holder hereof surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary, except as required by law.

THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA.

Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date (“Defaulted Interest”) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the close of business on any Record Date and, instead, shall be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a special record date (the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided for in the Indenture.

Payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note due on the Maturity Date will be made in immediately available funds upon presentation and surrender of this Note (and, with respect to any applicable repayment of this Note, upon delivery of instructions as contemplated on the reverse hereof) at the office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, currently the corporate trust office of the Trustee located at 40 Broad Street, 5th Floor, New York, New York 10004, or at such other paying agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, as the Company may determine;

provided

,

however

, that if the Specified Currency (as defined below) is other than United States dollars and such payment is to be made in the Specified Currency in accordance with the provisions set forth below, such payment will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account with a bank designated by the Holder hereof at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, provided that such bank has appropriate facilities therefor and that this Note is presented and surrendered and, if applicable, instructions are delivered at the aforementioned office or agency maintained by the Company in time for the Trustee to make such payment in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures.  Payment of interest due on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date

will be made at the aforementioned office or agency maintained by the Company or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register maintained by the Trustee;

provided

,

however

, that a Holder of U.S.$10,000,000 (or, if the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) will be entitled to receive interest payments on such Interest Payment Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds if such Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 calendar days prior to such Interest Payment Date.  Any such wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by such Holder.

If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day.

As used herein, “Business Day” means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York;

provided

,

however

, that if the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, such day must also not be a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the

Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing the Specified Currency (or, if the Specified Currency is Euro, such day must also be a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open).  “Principal Financial Center” means the capital city of the country issuing the Specified Currency, except that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, South African rands and Swiss francs, the “Principal Financial Center” shall be The City of New York, Sydney, Toronto, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.

The Company is obligated to make payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note in the currency in which this Note is denominated above (or, if such currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in the country issuing such currency or, if such currency is Euro, in the member states of the European Union that have adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty on European Union, then the currency which is at the time of such payment legal tender in the related country or in the adopting member states of the European Union, as the case may be) (the “Specified Currency”).  If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, except as otherwise provided below, any such amounts so payable by the Company will be converted by the Exchange Rate Agent specified above into United States dollars for payment to the Holder of this Note.

Any United States dollar amount to be received by the Holder of this Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent) selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for United States dollars for settlement on such payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of Notes scheduled to receive United States dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder of this Note by deductions from such payments.  If three such bid quotations are not available, payments on this Note will be made in the Specified Currency.

If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal,

premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency by submitting a written request for such payment to the Trustee at its corporate trust office in The City of New York on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.  Such written request may be mailed or hand delivered or sent by cable, telex or other form of facsimile transmission.  The Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of all future payments in the Specified Currency in respect of such principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, and need not file a separate election for each payment.  Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice delivered to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.

If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars and the Holder of this Note shall have duly made an election to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency, but the Specified Currency is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Note by making such payment in United States dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the second Business Day prior to such payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate.  The “Market Exchange Rate” for the Specified Currency other than United States dollars means the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for the Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Any payment made in United States dollars under such circumstances shall not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture).

All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.

The Company agrees to indemnify the Holder of any Note against any loss incurred by such Holder as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against the Company for any amount due hereunder and such judgment or order requiring payment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than the Specified Currency, and as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the Specified Currency amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order, and (ii) the rate of exchange at which such Holder, on the date of payment of such judgment or order, is able to purchase the Specified Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by such Holder, as the case may be.  The foregoing indemnity constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the Company and continues in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid.  The term “rate of exchange” includes any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, the relevant currency.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof and, if so specified on the face hereof, in an Addendum hereto, which further provisions shall have the same force and effect as if set forth on the face hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or “Other/Additional Provisions” apply to this Note as specified above, this Note shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such “Other/Additional Provisions”.

Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, UDR, Inc.  has caused this Note to be duly executed by one of its duly authorized officers.

UDR, INC.

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES A

DUE NINE MONTHS OR MORE FROM DATE OF ISSUE, FULLY AND

UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

(Fixed Rate)

This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities (the “Debt Securities”) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1995, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time (the “Indenture”), between the Company (successor by merger to UDR, Inc., a Virginia corporation) and U.S.  Bank National Association, successor trustee to Wachovia Bank, National Association, (formerly known as First Union National Bank of Virginia) as trustee (the “Trustee”, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is one of the series of Debt Securities designated as “Medium-Term Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue, Fully and Unconditionally Guaranteed by United Dominion Realty, L.P.” (the “Notes”).  All terms used but not defined in this Note or in an Addendum hereto shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture or on the face hereof, as the case may be.

United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”) as primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Holder and to the Trustee and their successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at the Maturity Date, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under the Indenture whether for principal of or interest on the Notes (and premium and Make-Whole Amount, if applicable) and all other monetary obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes (all such obligations guaranteed hereby by the Operating Partnership being the “Guarantee”).  The Holder of this Note may enforce its rights under the Guarantee directly against the Operating Partnership without first making a demand or taking action against the Company or any other person or entity.  The Operating Partnership may, without the consent of the Holder of this Note, assume all of the Company’s rights and obligations under this Note and, upon such assumption, the Company will be released from its liabilities under the Indenture and this Note.

This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S. $1,000 and integral multiples thereof or other Authorized Denomination specified on the face hereof.

This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the following two paragraphs, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date.

This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company on any date on or after the Initial Redemption Date, if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (the “Redemption Date”), on written notice given to the Holder hereof (in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture) not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date.  The “Redemption Price” shall be an amount equal to the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof) multiplied by the unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed.  The Initial Redemption Percentage, if any, shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be redeemed.  In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.

This Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (the “Repayment Date”).  For this Note to be repaid, the Trustee must receive at its corporate trust office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Repayment Date, such Note and instructions to such effect forwarded by the Holder hereof.  Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof shall be irrevocable.  In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.

If this Note is specified on the face hereof to be a Discount Note, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to the sum of (1) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) and, in the event of any redemption of this Note (if applicable), multiplied by the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if applicable) and (2) any unpaid interest accrued thereon to the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be.  The difference between the Issue Price and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as the “Discount”.

For purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be accrued so as to cause the yield on the Note to be constant.  The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period) and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated.  If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the “Initial Period”) is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued.  If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence.

The covenants set forth in Section 1004(a) and Section 1007 of the Indenture shall not apply to this Note, and the following covenants shall instead apply to this Note in place of the covenants set forth in Section 1004(a) and Section 1007 of the Indenture:

“The Trust will, and will cause the Subsidiaries to, have at all times Total Unencumbered Assets of not less than 150% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the Trust’s outstanding Unsecured Debt and the outstanding Unsecured Debt of the Subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP.

The Trust will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, incur any Debt if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such additional Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Debt of the Trust and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis determined in accordance with GAAP is greater than 65% of the sum of (without duplication) (i) the Trust’s Total Assets as of the end of the calendar quarter covered in the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, most recently filed with the Commission (or, if such filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act, with the Trustee) prior to the incurrence of such additional Debt and (ii) the purchase price of any real estate assets or mortgages receivable acquired, and the amount of any securities offering proceeds received (to the extent such proceeds were not used to acquire real estate assets or mortgages receivable or used to reduce Debt), by the Trust or any Subsidiary since the end of such calendar quarter, including those proceeds obtained in connection with the incurrence of such additional Debt.

‘Total Unencumbered Assets’ means the sum of, without duplication, those Undepreciated Real Estate Assets which are not subject to a lien securing Debt and all other assets, excluding accounts receivable and intangibles, of the Trust and the Subsidiaries not subject to a lien securing Debt, all determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP; provided, however, that all investments by the Trust and the Subsidiaries in unconsolidated joint ventures, unconsolidated limited partnerships, unconsolidated limited liability

companies and other unconsolidated entities shall be excluded from Total Unencumbered Assets to the extent that such investments would have otherwise been included.”

If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may, and in certain cases shall, be accelerated in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Notes or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Securities at the time outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of all such Debt Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions  of the Indenture.  Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, in certain instances, to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and other Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange heretofore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note at the times, places and rate or formula, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal hereof and any premium or interest hereon are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes having the same terms and provisions, of Authorized Denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued by the Company to the designated transferee or transferees.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different Authorized Denominations but otherwise having the same terms and provisions, as requested by the Holder hereof surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary, except as required by law.

THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA.

The Company may redeem all or part of this Note at any time at its option at a redemption price equal the greater of (1) the principal amount of this Note being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date or (2) the Make-Whole Amount for the principal amount of this Note being redeemed.  If this Note is redeemed on or after 90 days prior to the maturity date, the redemption price will equal the principal amount of this Note being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

“Make-Whole Amount” means, as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed, together with the scheduled payments of interest (exclusive of interest to the redemption date) from the redemption date to the maturity date of this Note being redeemed, in each case discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of this Note being redeemed to the redemption date.

“Adjusted Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date, the sum of (x) either (1) the yield for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue, under the heading that represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recent published statistical release designated “H.15 (519)” or any successor publication that is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and that establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption “Treasury Constant Maturities” (provided, if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term of this Note, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounded to the nearest month) or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date, in each case calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date, and (y) 0.45%.

“Comparable Treasury Issue” means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term from the redemption date to the maturity date of this Note that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Note.

“Comparable Treasury Price” means, with respect to any redemption date, (x) the average of three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations so obtained or (y) if fewer than five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations are so obtained, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations so obtained.

Exhibit 10.22

March 1, 2013

To: UDR, Inc. Bank Group

Re:

Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of October 25, 2011 (the “Credit Agreement”) among UDR, Inc. (“UDR”), the Lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the “Administrative Agent”).

UDR has requested that Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent, approve Fitch, Inc. as a Rating Agency under the Credit Agreement. Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent, is supportive of this request.

In addition, UDR has asked the Lenders to amend the first paragraph of the definition of “Applicable Margin” so that it reads as follows:

“Applicable Margin”

means the percentage rate set forth in the table below corresponding to the level (each a “Level”) into which the Borrower's Credit Rating then falls. As of the Agreement Date, the Applicable Margin is determined based on Level 31 Any change in the Borrower's Credit Rating which would cause it to move to a different Level shall be effective as of the first day of the first calendar month immediately following receipt by the Administrative Agent of written notice delivered by the Borrower in accordance with Section 8.4.(k) that the Borrower's Credit Rating has changed; provided, however, if the Borrower has not delivered the notice required by such Section but the Administrative Agent becomes aware that the Borrower's Credit Rating has changed, then the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, adjust the Level effective as of the first day of the first calendar month following the date the Administrative Agent becomes aware that the Borrower's Credit Rating has changed. During any period for which the Borrower has received three Credit Ratings which are not equivalent, the Applicable Margin will be determined by (a) the highest Credit Rating if they differ by only one Level and (b) the average of the two highest Credit Ratings if they differ by two or more Levels (unless the average is not a recognized Level, in which case the Applicable Margin will be based on the Level corresponding to the second highest Credit Rating). During any period for which the Borrower has received only two Credit Ratings and such Credit Ratings are not equivalent, the Applicable Margin will be determined by (i) the highest Credit Rating if they differ by only one Level and (ii) the median of the two Credit Ratings if they differ by two or more Levels (unless the median is not a recognized Level, in which case the Applicable Margin will be based on the Credit Rating one Level below the Level corresponding to the higher Credit Rating). During any period for which the Borrower has received a Credit Rating from only one Rating Agency, the Applicable Margin shall be determined based on such Credit Rating so long as such Credit Rating is from either S&P or Moody's. During any period that the Borrower has (x) not received a Credit Rating from any Rating Agency or (x) received a Credit Rating from only one Rating Agency that is neither S&P or Moody's, the Applicable Margin shall be determined based on Levels. The provisions of this definition shall be subject to Section 2.5.(c).

Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent and Lender, is supportive of UDR's request to amend the definition of “Applicable Margin” as set forth above and recommends each Lender agree to the requested amendment.  To signify agreement to the requested amendment, a Lender should complete and execute the signature block on the following page of this letter agreement and send a pdf of the executed letter agreement by e-mail to Paul Cushing (paul.cushing@alston.com) by no later than s:oo pm EST on Wednesday, March 13, 2013.

If you have any questions of a business nature, please contact Amit Khimji at (704) 410-1150, or if you have questions of a legal nature please contact Paul Cushing at (404) 881-7578 at Alston & Bird.

Exhibit 10.24

March 4, 2013

To:

UDR, Inc. Bank Group

Re:

Amendment to Term Loan Agreement dated as of December 29, 2010 (the “Loan Agreement”) among UDR, Inc. (“UDR”), the Lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the “Administrative Agent”).

UDR has requested that Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent, approve Fitch, Inc. as a Rating Agency under the Credit Agreement. Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent, is supportive of this request.

In addition, UDR has asked the Lenders to amend the first paragraph of the definition of “Applicable Margin” so that it reads as follows:

“Applicable Margin”

means the percentage per annum determined, at any time, based on the range into which the Borrower's Credit Rating then falls, in accordance with the levels in the table set forth below (each a “Level”). Any change in the Borrower's Credit Rating which would cause it to move to a different Level shall be effective as of the first day of the first calendar month immediately following receipt by the Agent of written notice delivered by the Borrower in accordance with Section 8-4.(m) that the Borrower's Credit Rating has changed; provided, however, if the Borrower has not delivered the notice required by such Section but the Agent becomes aware that the Borrower's Credit Rating has changed, then the Agent may, in its sole discretion, adjust the Level effective as of the first day of the first calendar month following the date the Agent becomes aware that the Borrower's Credit Rating has changed. During any period for which the Borrower has received three Credit Ratings which are not equivalent, the Applicable Margin be determined by (a) the highest Credit Rating if they differ by only one Level and (b) the average of the two highest Credit Ratings if they differ by two or more Levels (unless the average is not a recognized Level, in which case the Applicable Margin will be based on the Level corresponding to the second highest Credit Rating). During any period for which the Borrower has received only two Credit Ratings and such Credit Ratings are not equivalent, the Applicable Margin will be determined by (i) the highest Credit Rating if they differ by only one Level and (ii) the median of the two Credit Ratings if they differ by two or more Levels (unless the median is not a recognized Level, in which case the Applicable Margin will be based on the Credit Rating one Level below the Level corresponding to the higher Credit Rating). During any period for which the Borrower has received a Credit Rating from only one Rating Agency, the Applicable Margin shall be determined based on such Credit Rating so long as such Credit Rating is from either S&P or Moody's. During any period that the Borrower has (x) not received a Credit Rating from any Rating Agency or (y) received a Credit Rating from only one Rating Agency that is neither S&P or Moody's, the Applicable Margin shall be determined based on Level 4.

Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent and Lender, is supportive of UDR's request to amend the definition of “Applicable Margin” as set forth above and recommends each Lender agree to the requested amendment. To signify agreement to the requested amendment, a Lender should complete and execute the signature block on the following page of this letter agreement and send a pdf of the executed letter agreement by e-mail to Paul Cushing (paul.cushing@alston.com) by no later than s:oo pm EST on Wednesday, March 13, 2013

If you have any questions of a business nature, please contact Amit Khimji at (704) 410-1150, or if you have questions of a legal nature please contact Paul Cushing at (404) 881-7578 at Alston & Bird.
