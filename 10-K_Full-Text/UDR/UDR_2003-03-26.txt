PART I

Item 1.    BUSINESS

General

United Dominion
Realty Trust, Inc. is a self-administered equity real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages middle-market apartment communities nationwide. At December 31, 2002, our apartment portfolio included 260
communities located in 57 markets, with a total of 74,480 completed apartment homes. In addition, we had 616 apartment homes under development.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must
continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate, our income be derived primarily from real estate, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other
than our net capital gain) to our shareholders. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income to the extent we distribute such income to our shareholders. In 2002, we declared total
distributions of $1.11 per share to our shareholders, which represents our 26th year of consecutive dividend increases to our shareholders.

We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. Our corporate headquarters is located at 400 East Cary Street, Richmond, Virginia. Our
principal executive offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado. As of March 1, 2003, we had 1,734 full-time employees and 175 part-time employees.

Our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships, United
Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage Communities, L.P. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the company,” or “United Dominion” refer collectively
to United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

2002 Accomplishments

•

We provided a total shareholder return of 22%, which is above the total shareholder return attained by the Morgan Stanley REIT Index, the NAREIT Equity Index, and
the NAREIT Equity Apartment Index.

•

We increased our dividend for the 26th consecutive year.

•

We generated growth of funds from operations, or FFO, of 10.1% per diluted share and growth of adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, of 12.3% per diluted share
over 2001.

•

We lowered the weighted average rate on our debt from 6.6% at January 1, 2002 to 5.9% at December 31, 2002.

•

We increased the size of our unencumbered pool of assets to $2.4 billion.

•

We issued $200 million of seven-year 6.50% senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds of $198.5 million to reduce outstanding debt on our revolving credit
facility.

•

We refinanced $294 million of mortgage debt that had a weighted average interest rate of 8.0%.

•

We repurchased $138 million of outstanding debt securities with a weighted average interest rate of 8.3%.

•

We completed the sale of 3.0 million shares of our common stock at a price of $14.91 per share and used the net proceeds of $42.3 million to acquire apartment
communities.

•

We acquired 3,041 apartment homes in nine communities and one parcel of land for approximately $267 million and invested an additional $69 million to acquire
the interests held by development and investment partners in four existing communities with a total of 1,570 apartment homes.



•

We completed the disposition of 25 apartment communities with 6,990 apartment homes, one commercial property, and one parcel of land for an aggregate sales price of
approximately $319 million, exiting markets that no longer met our investment criteria.

•

We formed a new development joint venture which is expected to develop $210 million of new apartment homes over the next three to five years.

•

We launched process improvement programs in purchasing, pricing, lease standardization, revenue assurance, and payables processing to reduce costs and improve
resident services.

Business Objectives and
Operating Strategies

Our principal business
objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our shareholders with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:

•

own and operate middle-market apartments across a national platform, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our shareholders,

•

manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, and building apartment communities,

•

empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively,

•

measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets, and

•

manage the capital structure to ensure predictability of earnings and dividends.

In 2001, management established a long-term strategy that resulted in certain fundamental conclusions and
initial steps towards achieving our goals. We believe that we must distinguish ourselves within the industry to maintain a leadership position over the long-term. We believe an increased focus on being an excellent operator of apartment homes will
be a compelling and successful business model to differentiate United Dominion in the eyes of residents, associates, and investors. With this strategy, we believe that we can become the best in the multifamily industry based upon the following key
principles:

•

Operational Excellence

.    Operational excellence is a way of doing business with consistent, standard systems and business processes
throughout our organization, to provide customers, residents, and associates similar experiences regardless of location. Through operational excellence, we believe that we can enhance our existing portfolio and new properties we seek to acquire,
deliver superior service to our residents, and provide greater returns to our investors.

•

Middle-Market

.    We will focus our efforts on owning and managing apartments that provide housing for customers who cannot typically
afford an entry-level home, or customers who choose apartment living over other alternatives. We will primarily serve the price-sensitive, value-for-money customers, in the broad middle-market segments of the population.

•

Portfolio Management

.    We intend to continue to own and operate middle-market apartment homes across a geographically diverse platform.
We believe that enhancing our presence in 25 to 30 core markets will enable us to capitalize on operating efficiencies. As local market cycles create opportunities, we intend to exit current markets where long-term growth is below the national
average (the “non-core markets”), and redeploy capital within our core markets.

We believe that over the long-term, the fundamental principles of operational excellence, middle-market focus, and proactive portfolio
management will better position us to serve our residents, increase profitability, provide rewarding careers to our associates, and capitalize on changes in the marketplace.

Acquisitions and Mergers

Acquisitions.

During the past five years, we have increased our property portfolio by nearly 36,000
apartment homes by acquiring other REITs, private portfolios, and individual communities as part of our strategy



to enhance our geographic diversification. During the past four years, our dispositions have exceeded acquisitions, with acquisitions mostly
utilizing disposition proceeds to complete Section 1031 tax-deferred exchanges. During 2002, using the proceeds from our disposition program and our equity offering, we acquired nine communities with 3,041 apartment homes and one parcel of land at a
total cost of approximately $267 million, including the assumption of debt and the use of tax-free exchange funds. In addition, we invested an additional $69 million to acquire the interests held by development and investment partners in four
existing communities with a total of 1,570 apartment homes.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•

population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth, and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property
is located,

•

geographic location and type of community, including proximity to our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale,

•

construction quality, condition, and design of the community,

•

current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow,

•

potential for capital appreciation of the property,

•

ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through upgrades and repositioning,

•

terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases,

•

occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity,

•

prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property, and

•

competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area.

Mergers.

The apartment sector of
the real estate industry has undergone modest but steady consolidation over the past decade. Some apartment REITs and privately owned portfolios may seek to be acquired by large, well capitalized REITs that have superior access to the capital
markets. In 1998, we participated in this consolidation process by completing the following mergers:

•

On March 27, 1998, we acquired ASR Investments Corporation in a statutory merger. ASR was a publicly traded multifamily REIT that owned 39 communities with 7,550
apartment homes located in Arizona, Texas, New Mexico and the state of Washington. The merger furthered our investment in Southwestern markets, provided an initial presence in the Pacific Northwest and added communities in Houston and Phoenix.

•

On December 7, 1998, we acquired American Apartment Communities II, Inc., or AAC, in a statutory merger. In connection with this acquisition, we acquired 53
communities with 14,001 apartment homes located primarily in California, the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest, and Florida. The merger enabled us to enter new major markets, many of which are strong growth markets. Through the merger, we entered
Portland, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Jose, Monterey, Los Angeles, Denver, Indianapolis, and Detroit. In addition, AAC added communities to our portfolios in Columbus, Tampa, South Florida and Seattle.

including acquisitions through mergers, during the past five years (

Dispositions

We regularly monitor and adjust our assets
to increase portfolio profitability. During 2002, we sold nearly 7,000 of our slower growing, non-core apartment homes while exiting some markets in an effort to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. Proceeds from the disposition
program were used to acquire replacement communities, fund development projects, and to a lesser extent, to reduce outstanding debt balances.

Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include:

•

current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset,

•

potential increases in new construction in the market area,

•

areas where the economy is not expected to grow substantially, and

•

markets where we do not intend to establish long-term concentration.

At December 31, 2002, there were two apartment communities, two parcels of land, and one commercial property
classified as real estate held for disposition. In addition, we were actively marketing 17 apartment communities for sale in non-core markets. We are in the market for replacement properties that will correspond with our expected sales activity to
prevent dilution to earnings.

Development and Upgrading
Activities

During 2002, we continued to
reposition properties in targeted markets where there was an opportunity to add value and achieve greater than inflationary increases in rents over the long term. In 2002, we spent  $31.7 million to finish 462 apartment homes in two additional
phases to two existing communities. In addition, revenue enhancing capital expenditures, including water sub-metering, the initial installation of microwaves or washer-dryers, and extensive interior upgrades totaled $9.4 million or $124 per home for
the year ended December 31, 2002.

In September
2002, we signed a development joint venture agreement with AEGON USA Realty Advisors, Inc. in which we serve as the managing member. The joint venture is expected to develop approximately eight to ten garden style apartment communities over the next
three to five years, with a total development cost of up to $210 million. The joint venture will obtain bank construction financing for 65% to 80% of total costs. The joint venture will provide equity contributions for the balance of the costs with
AEGON providing 80% and United Dominion providing 20%. We will serve as the developer, general contractor, and property manager for the joint venture, and will guarantee those project development costs, excluding financing costs (including fees and
interest), which exceed the defined project cost budgeted amounts for each respective project, as they come to fruition. As of December 31, 2002, the joint venture had not commenced operations.

We will continue to seek out development opportunities in our
core markets and seek to raise equity with potential joint venture partners to start new development programs in 2003. We anticipate that any potential starts will occur in mid-2003. Until then, we will strive to create value for the portfolio
through rehabilitation of existing properties and phase II opportunities within the existing portfolio.

Financing Activities

As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we utilized proceeds from dispositions, equity offerings, and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, and acquire apartment
communities. The following is a list of our major financing activities in 2002:

•

We borrowed an additional $253.6 million under our existing Fannie Mae credit facilities and $70.7 million under a new $72 million Freddie Mac revolving credit
facility.

•

We repaid $305.8 million of secured debt and $210.4 million of unsecured debt (includes tender offer and prepayment penalties referred to below), assumed $41.6
million of secured debt in connection with the acquisition of properties, and repaid $35.9 million of secured debt in connection with the disposition of properties.



•

We sold 3.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $14.91 per share in March 2002. The net proceeds of $42.3 million were used to acquire apartment
communities.

•

We refinanced secured debt during the first quarter of 2002 using proceeds from the new Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit facilities and incurred prepayment
penalties of $15.8 million on the refinancing of these mortgages, while freeing $8.2 million of cash previously escrowed with former lenders. Management believes that the net present value of these refinancing transactions ranges from approximately
$17 million to $20 million.

•

We issued $200 million of 6.50% senior unsecured notes due in June 2009 in June 2002. The net proceeds from the issuance of $198.5 million were used to reduce
outstanding debt under our $375 million unsecured revolving credit facility.

•

We repurchased a total of $137.8 million of unsecured debt during the third and fourth quarters of 2002 and paid premiums of $17.9 million. Management believes that
these redemptions will generate a net present value savings of approximately $1 million to $3 million.

•

We repurchased 914,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $14.16. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 2.3 million common shares remained
available for repurchase under our common stock repurchase program.

•

We filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2002 a new shelf registration statement that provides for the issuance of up to $1 billion aggregate
amount of debt securities, preferred stock, and common stock from time to time in one or more offerings to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets. The new $1 billion shelf registration statement replaces the
$294 million remaining on our previous $700 million shelf registration statement filed in December 1999.

Markets

At December 31, 2002, we owned apartment communities in 57 markets in 20 states. Of those markets, 28 markets, or 49%, generated
positive same community net operating income growth. We have a geographically diverse portfolio and we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and
economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings.

We believe changing demographics will have a significant impact on the apartment industry over the next two decades. In particular, we believe the annual number of young people entering the workforce
and creating households will be significantly higher over the next 10 to 15 years as compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past 10 years. The number of single people and single parent households continues to grow significantly.
There is also higher growth in immigration than had been expected. Each of these population segments has a high propensity to rent.

The weakness in the overall United States economy has adversely affected employment and other significant elements of the economy that
drive productivity and the financial strength of business. To maintain our occupancy levels during these economic conditions, we have provided certain concessions to our residents.

Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management, expense control, increased
resident retention efforts, and the realignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of operations, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting the middle-market of renters across a
geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational improvement.

Communities

At December 31, 2002, our apartment portfolio included 260 communities having a total of 74,480 completed apartment homes. In addition, we had 616 apartment homes under development. The overall quality of our portfolio
has significantly improved since 1998 with the disposition of non-core apartment homes



and the upgrading of most of our communities. The upgrading of the portfolio provides several key benefits related to portfolio
profitability. It enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses, such as water and sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident.
In addition, it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home, and therefore increases cash flow.

Same Communities

Our primary earnings driver is same apartment community operations. During 2002, our same communities provided 87% of our property
operating income. In 2002, same community property operating income decreased 0.8% or $2.8 million compared to the prior year. The overall decrease in property operating income was primarily driven by a 17.1% increase in vacancy loss and a 37.1%
increase in concessions. These decreases in income were partially offset by a 32.8% increase in sub-meter, trash, and vacant utility reimbursements, a 0.3% increase in rental rates, and a 13.0% increase in other income. Operating expenses increased
by 0.9%, much of which resulted from a 10.6% increase in repairs and maintenance costs and a 3.4% increase in real estate taxes, both of which were partially offset by a 5.1% decrease in utilities expense, a 40.2% decrease in incentive compensation
expense, and a 9.5% decrease in insurance costs.

Average physical occupancy, rental rates, and operating margins at our same communities for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 are set forth below:

Customers

We focus on the broad middle-market segment
of the apartment market that generally consists of  renters-by-necessity. This group includes young professionals, blue-collar families, single parent households, older singles, immigrants, non-related parties and families renting while waiting
to purchase a home. We believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in terms of rent growth, stability of occupancy, and investment opportunities.

We believe there will be a significant increase in the number of younger renters over the next 10 to 15
years. Accordingly, we plan to target some of our incremental investments to communities that will be attractive to younger households. These communities will often be located close to where young people work, shop, and play.

Tax Matters

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate, our income be derived primarily from real estate, and that we
distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to our shareholders. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income
to the extent net income is distributed to our shareholders.

Competitive Conditions

In most of our markets, competition for new residents is intense. Some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. Some competing communities may use concessions or lower rents to obtain competitive
advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities.



The competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. In addition,
other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies, and other apartment
REITs. This competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources than we do.

Management believes that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and
investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:

•

a fully integrated organization with property management, development, acquisition, marketing, and financing expertise,

•

scalable operating and support systems,

•

purchasing power,

•

geographic diversification with a presence in more than 57 markets across the country, and

•

local presence in many of our major markets which allows us to be a local operating expert.

Inflation

Substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which may enable us to realize increased
rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Such short-term leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation, although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the
lease term without penalty. Short-term leases and relatively consistent demand allow rents, and therefore cash flow from the portfolio, to provide an attractive hedge against inflation.

Environmental Matters

To date, compliance with federal, state, and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital
expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. However, over the past 15 years, the issue has been raised regarding the presence of asbestos and other hazardous materials in existing real estate properties, and within the past year there has been
an increase in the number of claims of potential health-related issues allegedly caused by the presence of mold in confined spaces. We have a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of the plan, Phase I environmental site
investigations and reports have been completed for each property we own. In addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report
prior to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In
some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not believe we
will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. Management believes that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a conservative
posture toward accepting known risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or
purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that
community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities.



We are unaware
of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise
aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations
will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently
actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition. To our knowledge, we are in compliance with all applicable
environmental rules and regulations.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability
coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, in all material respects, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts
necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.

Factors Affecting Our Business and Prospects

There are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations, some of which are beyond our
control. The following is a description of some of the important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired.

Unfavorable Changes in Apartment Market and Economic
Conditions Could Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels and Rental Rates.

Market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore
our profitability. Factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following:

•

a reduction in jobs and other local economic downturns,

•

declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable,

•

oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes,

•

declines in household formation, and

•

rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs.

The weakness in the United States
economy has been exacerbated by the events of September 11, 2001, as well as by the United States’ war on terrorism. The weak economy has adversely affected employment and other significant elements of the economy that drive productivity and
the financial strength of businesses. Any continuation or worsening of current economic conditions, generally and in our principal market areas, could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels, our rental rates, and our ability to
strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities. This may impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our shareholders.

Acquisitions or New Development May Not Achieve Anticipated Results.

We intend
to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:

•

An acquired community may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure related to the acquired property may go undetected
during our due diligence procedures.



•

When we acquire an apartment community, we often invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability. These additional investments may not
produce the anticipated improvements in profitability.

•

New developments may not achieve pro forma rents or occupancy levels, or problems with construction or local building codes may delay initial occupancy dates for all
or a portion of a development community.

Possible Difficulty of Selling Apartment Communities Could Limit Operational and Financial Flexibility.

We periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but
market conditions could change and purchasers would not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us. A weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions. Furthermore, a significant portion
of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal
income tax purposes. As a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales. In addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four
years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.

Increased Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease Apartment Homes or Increase or Maintain Rents.

Our
apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in a
particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents.

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and Create Refinancing Risk.

We are subject to the
risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due
to debt covenant restraints. We cannot assure you that sufficient cash flow will be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a REIT, nor can we assure you that the
full limits of our line of credit will be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. Additionally, we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. We
may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do
so.

Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue
Could Impair Debt Service Payments and Distributions to Shareholders.

If our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and
principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities:

•

the national and local economies,

•

local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes,

•

tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located,

•

our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance, and insurance, and

•

rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities.

Expenses associated with our investment in a community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are
generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from



that community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a
loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.

Debt Level May Be Increased.

Our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt
that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase
the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.

Financing May Not Be Available and Could be Dilutive.

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends
on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. Debt or equity financing may not be available in
sufficient amounts, or on favorable terms or at all. If we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing shareholders could be diluted.

Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our
Profitability.

We intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities. Development activities may be conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties.
Our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:

•

We may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations,
which could result in increased development costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations.

•

If we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our
development potential may be limited.

•

We may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring
them.

•

We may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and
we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs.

•

Occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from
meeting our profitability goals for that community.

Construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets, and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have, in some cases, exceeded our original estimates. We may experience similar cost increases in the future.
Our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our Growth.

We may from time to time make acquisitions outside
of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. We may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. These risks include, among others:

•

inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies,

•

inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities,

•

inability to hire and retain key personnel, and

•

lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures.



Changing
Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and Could Affect the Market Price of Our Securities.

We currently have, and expect to incur in the future, debt bearing interest at rates that vary with market interest
rates. Therefore, if interest rates increase, our interest costs will rise to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged effectively. In addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual
yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities.

Limited Investment Opportunities Could Adversely Affect Our Growth

.    We expect that other real estate
investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other apartment REITs. This
competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources than we do. As a result, we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms, which could
adversely affect our growth.

Failure to
Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel Could Create Inefficiencies.

To grow successfully, we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of
properties. In addition, we must be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity. Failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on
our investments and our overall profitability.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May Result in Material Charges.

From time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate
hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. If the pricing of new debt securities is not within the parameters of, or market interest rates produce a lower interest cost than that
which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges.

Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could
Result in Substantial Costs.

Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of
contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real
estate. In addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs could be substantial, and in many
cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to
borrow against, sell, or rent an affected property.

Compliance With REIT Share Ownership Limit May Prevent Takeovers Beneficial to Shareholders.

One of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is that
no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the Internal Revenue Code, during the last half of any taxable year. Our charter includes provisions allowing us to
stop transfers of and redeem our shares that are intended to assist us in complying with this requirement. These provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control
might involve a premium price for our shareholders or might otherwise be in our shareholders’ best interests.

We are Subject to Certain Tax Risks

.    We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and quarterly basis)



established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions. Only limited judicial or administrative interpretation
exists for these provisions and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. In addition, future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may apply
to us, potentially with retroactive effect, and adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. We may receive significant non-qualifying income or acquire non-qualifying assets, which as a result, may cause us to approach the income and assets
test limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. There is a risk that we may not satisfy these tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. We may
also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify. This would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax
liability. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state, and local taxes on our income and property.

Adverse Legislative or Regulatory Tax Changes May Affect the Tax Treatment of Our Company or Our Shareholders or the Value of Our
Stock

.    The U.S. federal income tax governing REITs and other corporations or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time. Any of those new laws or interpretations thereof may take effect
retroactively and could adversely affect our company or our shareholders. On January 7, 2003, the Bush Administration released a proposal that would exclude corporate dividends from a stockholder’s taxable income, to the extent that the
earnings from which the dividends are paid have been subject to corporate income tax. REIT dividends generally would not be exempt from income tax in the hands of a stockholder under the Bush Administration’s proposal in its current form,
because a REIT’s income generally is not subject to corporate-level tax. However, under the current proposal, if a REIT receives excludable dividend income from an investment in another corporation (such as a taxable REIT subsidiary), the REIT
can pass that dividend income through to the REIT’s stockholders without subjecting the stockholders to tax on that income. If enacted, the Bush Administration’s proposal could cause investors to view the stock of non-REIT corporations as
more attractive relative to the stock of REITs than is the case currently. There can be no assurance regarding the form in which this proposal ultimately will be enacted, whether it will in fact be enacted, or what effect, if any, its enactment may
have on the value of our stock.

The Ability
of Our Shareholders to Control Our Policies and Effect a Change of Control of Our Company is Limited, Which May Not Be in Our Shareholders’ Best Interests.

Under the terms of our shareholder rights plan, our Board of
Directors can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Unless our Board of Directors approves the person’s purchase, after that person acquires more than 15% of our
outstanding common stock, all other shareholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value. Purchases by other shareholders would substantially reduce the value and influence of the
shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person. Our Board of Directors, however, can prevent the shareholder rights plan from operating in this manner. This gives our Board of Directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a
person’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us.

PART II

Item 5.    MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Common Stock

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “UDR.” The following tables set forth the quarterly
high and low sale prices per common share reported on the NYSE for each quarter of the last two years. Distribution information for common stock reflects distributions declared per share for each calendar quarter and paid at the end of the following
month.

On March
18, 2003, the closing sale price of our common stock was $15.79 per share on the NYSE and there were 7,464 holders of record of the 108,792,959 outstanding shares of our common stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax purposes, approximately 50% of the distributions for each of
the four quarters of 2002 represented ordinary income to our shareholders, 12% represented long-term capital gain, 10% represented unrecaptured section 1250 gain, and 28% represented return of capital to our shareholders.

We pay regular quarterly distributions to holders of shares of
our common stock. Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our actual funds from operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and other factors. The annual distribution payment for calendar year 2002 necessary for United Dominion to maintain its status as a REIT was approximately $0.49 per share. We declared total distributions of
$1.11 per share for 2002.



Series D Preferred Stock

The Series D Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock has no stated par value and a liquidation preference of $25 per share. The Series D has no voting rights, no stated maturity, and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption, and is convertible into 1.5385 shares of
common stock at the option of the holder of the Series D at any time at $16.25 per share. We have the right to cause the holder of the Series D to convert the Series D to common shares at $16.25 based on twenty trading days at or above $17.06 for
the life of the security. We have the right to purchase 2 million shares of the Series D in accordance with a predetermined schedule, provided that the volume weighted average price of our common shares is $16.25 for a twenty day trading period. The
repurchase price payable will be computed in accordance with the table below, expressed as a percentage of the liquidation preference, determined by the period in which the Series D repurchase date occurs, together with all accrued and unpaid
dividends to and including the repurchase date:

Series D Repurchase

After
December 7, 2003, we may, at our option, redeem at any time all or part of the Series D at a price per share of $25, payable in cash, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, provided that the current market price of our common stock at least equals
the conversion price, initially set at $16.25 per share. The redemption is payable solely out of the sale proceeds of other capital stock. In addition, we may not redeem in any consecutive twelve-month period a number of shares of Series D having an
aggregate liquidation preference of more than $100 million.

Distributions declared on the Series D in 2002 were $1.98 per share or $.4955 per quarter. The Series D is not listed on any exchange.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under which holders of our common and preferred stock may elect to automatically
reinvest their distributions and make additional cash payments to acquire additional shares of our common stock. Shareholders who do not participate in the plan continue to receive dividends as declared. As of March 18, 2003, there were 3,532
participants in the plan.

Operating Partnership Units

From time to time we issue shares of our
common stock in exchange for operating partnership units, or OP Units, tendered to our operating partnerships, United Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage Communities, L.P., for redemption in accordance with the provisions of their respective
agreements. At December 31, 2002, there were 6,368,570 OP Units and 377,418 OP Units in United Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage Communities, L.P., respectively, that were owned by non-affiliated limited partners. United Dominion Realty, L.P. OP
Units are convertible into common stock at an exchange ratio of one share for each OP Unit. Heritage Communities, L.P. OP Units are convertible into common stock at an exchange ratio of 1.575 shares for each OP Unit. During 2002, we issued a total
of 92,159 shares of common stock in exchange for OP Units.

Item 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial and other information as of and for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2002. The table should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included elsewhere in this Report.



UNITED
DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

(in thousands, except per share data and apartment homes owned)



(a)

In 1998, United Dominion completed the following statutory mergers: (i) ASR Investments Corporation Inc. on March 27, 1998 for an aggregate purchase price of $323
million and; (ii) American Apartment Communities II on December 7, 1998 for an aggregate purchase price of $794 million.

(b)

Funds from operations (“FFO”) is defined as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (losses)
from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, less preferred dividends and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trust’s definition issued in October 1999 which was effective beginning January 1, 2000. United Dominion considers FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that FFO should be considered along
with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flows as a measure of United Dominion’s activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. For
2001, FFO includes a non-recurring charge of $8.6 million related to workforce reductions, other severance costs, executive office relocation costs, and the write down of seven undeveloped land sites along with United Dominion’s investment in
an online apartment leasing company. For 2000, FFO includes a non-recurring charge of $3.7 million related to the settlement of litigation and an organizational charge.

(c)

Adjusted funds from operations is defined as FFO less recurring capital expenditures for our stabilized portfolio.

Forward-Looking Statements

This annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning property acquisitions and dispositions, development activity and capital expenditures, capital raising activities, rent growth,
occupancy, and rental expense growth. Words such as “expects”, “anticipates”, “intends”, “plans”, “believes”, “seeks”, “estimates,” and variations of such words and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of United Dominion Realty Trust,
Inc. to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among other things, unanticipated adverse business developments affecting United Dominion, or its
properties, adverse changes in the real estate markets and general and local economies and business conditions. Although United Dominion believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of
the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore such statements included in this report may not prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such
information should not be regarded as a representation by United Dominion or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or the objectives and plans of United Dominion will be achieved.

Business Overview

United Dominion is a real estate investment trust, or REIT,
that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages middle-market apartment communities nationwide. We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation and our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships, United Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage
Communities, L.P. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” or “United Dominion” refer collectively to United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

From 1996 through 1999, United Dominion acquired
other REITs, private portfolios, and individual communities to create a national platform. Since that time, we have upgraded the quality of our portfolio through capital reinvestment, development, divestitures and acquisitions, and invested in
infrastructure and technology to support our portfolio of assets. In 2001, management established a long-term strategy that resulted in certain fundamental conclusions and initial steps towards achieving our goals.

We believe that we must distinguish ourselves within the
industry to maintain a leadership position over the long-term. We believe an increased focus on being an excellent operator of apartment homes will be a compelling and successful business model to differentiate United Dominion in the eyes of
residents, associates, and investors. With this strategy, we believe that we can become the best in the multifamily industry based upon the following key principles:

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE

—In short, operational excellence is a way of doing business with
consistent, standard systems and business processes throughout our organization, to provide customers, residents,



and associates similar experiences regardless of location. Through operational excellence, we believe that we can enhance our existing
portfolio and new properties we seek to acquire, deliver superior service to our residents, and provide greater returns to our investors.

MIDDLE-MARKET

—United Dominion will focus efforts on owning and managing apartments that provide housing for customers who
cannot typically afford an entry-level home, or customers who choose apartment living over other alternatives. We will primarily serve the price-sensitive, value-for-money customers, in the broad middle-market segments of the population.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

—We intend to
continue to own and operate middle-market apartment homes across a geographically diverse platform. We believe that enhancing our presence in 25 to 30 core markets will enable us to capitalize on operating efficiencies. As local market cycles create
opportunities, we intend to exit current markets where long-term growth is below the national average (the “non-core markets”), and redeploy capital within our core markets.

We believe that over the long-term, the fundamental principles of operational excellence, middle-market
focus, and proactive portfolio management will better position United Dominion to serve its residents, increase profitability, provide rewarding careers to our associates, and capitalize on changes in the marketplace.

At December 31, 2002, United Dominion’s portfolio
included 260 communities with 74,480 apartment homes nationwide. The following table summarizes United Dominion’s market information by major geographic markets (includes real estate held for disposition, real estate under development, and
land, but excludes commercial properties):



Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet
present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective
working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. United Dominion’s primary source of liquidity is its cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to its
portfolio of apartment homes. United Dominion routinely uses its unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing. During the past several years, proceeds from
the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities.

United Dominion expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements generally through its net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements. We expect to meet certain long-term
liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the repayment of financing on development activities, and potential property acquisitions, through long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, the disposition of properties, and the issuance
of additional debt or equity securities of United Dominion. We believe that our net cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by United Dominion in accordance with REIT
requirements in both the short- and long-term. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations.

United Dominion filed a shelf registration statement in
December 1999 providing for the issuance of up to an aggregate of $700 million in common shares, preferred shares, and debt securities to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets. Under this shelf registration statement,
United Dominion sold 3.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $14.91 per share in March 2002 and issued $200 million of 6.50% senior unsecured notes due June 2009 in June 2002. In December 2002, United Dominion replaced its existing shelf
with a new shelf registration statement providing for the issuance of up to an aggregate of $1 billion in debt securities, preferred stock, and common stock and, as a result, the previous shelf registration will no longer be used for our securities
offerings. In January 2003, coinciding with our inclusion in the S&P MidCap 400 Index, United Dominion sold 2.0 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $15.71 per share under the new shelf registration statement. We received
net proceeds from this offering of approximately $31 million, which will be used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. In February 2003, United Dominion sold $150 million of 4.50% medium-term notes due in March 2008 under a new $300
million medium-term note program. The net proceeds from the issuance of approximately $149 million are anticipated to be used to repay amounts outstanding on United Dominion’s $375 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Access to capital
markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance.

Future Capital Needs

Future development expenditures are expected to be funded primarily through joint ventures or with proceeds from the sale of property and, to a lesser extent, cash flows provided by operating activities. Acquisition activity in
strategic markets is expected to be largely financed through the issuance of equity and debt securities, the issuance of operating partnership units, the assumption of secured debt, and by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of property in
non-strategic markets.

During 2003, United
Dominion has approximately $19.5 million of secured debt and $115.1 million of unsecured debt maturing that we anticipate repaying using proceeds from mortgage refinancing activity, borrowings under secured or unsecured credit facilities, or the
issuance of new unsecured debt securities.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our
critical accounting policies are those having the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. These policies include those related to



(1) capital expenditures, (2) impairment of long-lived assets, and (3) derivatives and hedging activities. With respect to these
critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented.

Capital Expenditures

In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States, United Dominion capitalizes those expenditures related to acquiring new assets, materially enhancing the value of an existing asset, or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset. Expenditures necessary to
maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.

During 2002, $42.8 million or $563 per home was spent on capital expenditures for all of United Dominion’s communities excluding development and commercial properties. These capital improvements
included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances, other recurring capital expenditures such as HVAC equipment, roofs, landscaping, siding, parking lots, and other non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures, which aggregated
$32.3 million or $425 per home. In addition, revenue enhancing capital expenditures, including water sub-metering, the initial installation of microwaves or washer-dryers, and extensive interior upgrades totaled $9.4 million or $124 per home
and major renovations totaled $1.1 million or $14 per home for the year ended December 31, 2002.

The following table outlines capital expenditures and repairs and maintenance costs for United Dominion’s total portfolio, excluding real estate under development and commercial properties for the
periods presented (dollars in thousands):

Total
capital improvements decreased $10.3 million or $141 per home in 2002 compared to 2001 as challenging economic conditions negatively impacted our potential to generate investment returns. United Dominion will continue to selectively add revenue
enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of United Dominion’s cost of capital. Recurring capital expenditures during 2003 are currently expected to be approximately $435 per home.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

United Dominion records impairment losses
on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net
book value of those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced
to fair market value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.



We review the carrying value of our portfolio of assets on a regular basis. During 2002,
United Dominion pursued its strategy of exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited. As a result, 25 apartment communities were placed under contract and two of these assets were ultimately sold at net selling prices below their net
book values. Accordingly, United Dominion recorded an aggregate $2.3 million impairment loss for the write down of a portfolio of apartment communities in Memphis, Tennessee. In 2001, in connection with management’s analysis of the carrying
value of all undeveloped land parcels, United Dominion recognized an aggregate $2.8 million impairment loss on seven undeveloped sites in selected markets. An impairment loss was indicated as a result of the net book value of the assets being
greater than the estimated fair market value less the cost of disposal.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

United Dominion uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2002, United Dominion had 13 interest rate swap agreements
with a notional value aggregating $232 million that are used to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt. These derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. While we
intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if a particular interest rate swap does not qualify as highly effective, any change in the fair value of the derivative used as a hedge would be reflected in current earnings.
Furthermore, should any change in management strategy, or any other circumstance, cause an existing highly effective hedge to become ineffective, the accumulated loss or gain in the value of the derivative instrument since its inception would be
immediately reclassified from the shareholders’ equity section of the balance sheet to current earnings.

Interest rate swaps, where United Dominion effectively makes fixed rate payments and receives variable rate payments to eliminate its
variable rate exposure, are entered into to manage the interest rate risk in our existing balance sheet mix. These instruments are valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future variable cash receipts and the
discounted expected fixed cash payments. The variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves. We have not changed our methods of calculating these fair values or
developing the underlying assumptions. The values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change. Any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest rates will
impact our swap valuations. The fair value of our existing swap portfolio is likely to fluctuate materially from year to year based on changing levels of interest rates and shortening swap terms to maturity. Information about the fair values,
notional amounts, and contractual terms of United Dominion’s interest rate swaps can be found in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements and the section titled “Interest Rate Risk” below.

Potential losses are limited to counterparty risk in
situations where United Dominion is owed money; that is, when United Dominion holds contracts with positive fair values. We do not expect any losses from counterparties failing to meet their obligations as the counterparties are highly rated credit
quality U.S. financial institutions and management believes that the likelihood of realizing material losses from counterparty non-performance is remote. At December 31, 2002, United Dominion had unrealized losses totaling $9.6 million on derivative
transactions, which if terminated, would require a cash outlay. United Dominion presently has no intention to terminate these contracts. There are no credit concerns related to our obligations and we expect to meet those obligations without default.

The following discussion explains the changes in
net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing and financing activities that are presented in United Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2002, United Dominion’s cash flow provided by operating activities was $226.7 million compared to
$224.4 million for 2001. During 2002, cash flow from operating activities resulted



primarily from increased rental revenues from a larger portfolio and decreased interest expense that were partially offset by increased
rental expenses, lower collections on escrow accounts and receivables, and increased payments of accrued incentive compensation.

Investing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash used in investing activities was $65.1 million compared to $64.1 million for 2001. Changes
in the level of investing activities from period to period reflects United Dominion’s strategy as it relates to its acquisition, capital expenditure, development, and disposition programs, as well as the impact of the capital market environment
on these activities.

Acquisitions

During the year ended December 31, 2002,
United Dominion acquired nine communities with 3,041 apartment homes and one parcel of land for approximately $267 million. In addition, in June 2002, United Dominion purchased, for approximately $52 million, the remaining two apartment
communities with 644 apartment homes that were part of an unconsolidated development joint venture in which United Dominion owned a 25% interest and served as the managing partner. In August 2002, United Dominion purchased the outside
partnership interest in two properties in California containing 926 apartment homes for approximately $17 million.

During 2003, we plan to continue to channel new investments to those markets that are projected to provide the best investment returns for
us over the next ten years. Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including past performance, expected job growth, current and anticipated housing supply and demand, and the ability to attract and support household formation.

Real Estate Under Development

Development activity is focused in core
markets that have strong operations in place. For the year ended December 31, 2002, United Dominion invested approximately $22.8 million in development projects, down $30.8 million from its 2001 level of $53.6 million.

The following projects were under development at December 31,
2002:

In
addition, United Dominion owns seven parcels of land that it continues to hold for future development that had a carrying value at December 31, 2002 of $9.4 million. Six of the seven parcels represent additional phases to existing communities as
United Dominion plans to add apartment homes adjacent to currently owned communities that are in improving markets.

The following projects were completed during the year ended December 31, 2002:



Disposition
of Investments

For the year ended December
31, 2002, United Dominion sold 25 communities with a total of 6,990 apartment homes, one commercial property, and one parcel of land for an aggregate sales price of approximately $319 million and recognized gains for financial reporting
purposes of $31.5 million. Proceeds from the sales were applied primarily to acquire communities and reduce debt. In addition, during the first quarter of 2002, $3.1 million in proceeds was received on the condemnation of 96 units of a
community in Fresno, California that resulted in a gain of $1.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2001, United Dominion sold nine communities with 1,889 apartment homes and five parcels of land for an aggregate sales price of approximately
$141.3 million and recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of $24.7 million. Proceeds from the sales were used primarily to repurchase United Dominion’s 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock during the second quarter of
2001, and to a lesser extent, to reduce long-term debt, repurchase common shares, and to complete Section 1031 exchanges to defer taxable gains.

During 2003, United Dominion plans to continue to pursue its strategy of exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and
redeploying capital into markets that would enhance future growth rates and economies of scale. We intend to use proceeds from 2003 dispositions to acquire communities, fund development activity, and reduce debt.

Development Joint Ventures

In June 2000, United Dominion completed the formation of a
joint venture that would invest approximately $101 million to develop five apartment communities with a total of 1,438 apartment homes. United Dominion owned a 25% interest in the joint venture and served as the managing partner of the joint venture
as well as the developer, general contractor, and property manager. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, United Dominion recognized fee income of approximately $0.6 million, $2.6 million, and $3.0 million, respectively, for general
contracting, developer, and management services provided by United Dominion to the joint venture. In December 2001, United Dominion purchased three of the five apartment communities for a total aggregate cost of approximately $61 million. In June
2002, United Dominion purchased the remaining two communities for a total aggregate cost of approximately $52 million.

In September 2002, United Dominion signed a development joint venture agreement with AEGON USA Realty Advisors, Inc. in which United
Dominion serves as the managing member. The joint venture is expected to develop approximately eight to ten garden style apartment communities over the next three to five years, with a total development cost of up to $210 million. The joint venture
will obtain bank construction financing for 65% to 80% of total costs. The joint venture will provide equity contributions for the balance of the costs with AEGON providing 80% and United Dominion providing 20%. United Dominion will serve as the
developer, general contractor, and property manager for the joint venture, and will guarantee those project development costs, excluding financing costs (including fees and interest), which exceed the defined project cost budgeted amounts for each
respective project, as they come to fruition. As of December 31, 2002, the joint venture had not commenced operations.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities during 2002 was $163.1 million compared to $166.0 million for 2001. As part of the plan to improve
United Dominion’s balance sheet position, we utilized proceeds from dispositions, equity and debt offerings, and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, and purchase new properties.

The following is a summary of our financing activities for the
year ended December 31, 2002:

•

Borrowed an additional $253.6 million under our existing Fannie Mae credit facilities and $70.7 million under a new $72 million Freddie Mac revolving credit
facility.



•

Repaid $305.8 million of secured debt and $210.4 million of unsecured debt (includes tender offer and prepayment penalties referred to below), assumed $41.6 million
of secured debt in connection with the acquisition of properties, and repaid $35.9 million of secured debt in connection with the disposition of properties.

•

Sold 3.0 million common shares at a price of $14.91 per share in March 2002. The net proceeds of $42.3 million were used to acquire apartment communities.

•

Refinanced secured debt during the first quarter of 2002 using proceeds from the new Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit facilities and incurred prepayment penalties
of $15.8 million on the refinancing of these mortgages, while freeing $8.2 million of cash previously escrowed with former lenders. Management believes that the net present value of these refinancing transactions ranges from approximately $17
million to $20 million.

•

Issued $200 million of 6.50% senior unsecured notes due in June 2009 in June 2002. The net proceeds from the issuance of $198.5 million were used to reduce
outstanding debt under our $375 million unsecured revolving credit facility.

•

Repurchased the following unsecured debt during the third and fourth quarters of 2002

(dollars in thousands)

:

Management believes that these redemptions will generate a net present value savings of approximately $1 million to $3 million.

•

Repurchased 914,000 common shares at an average price of $14.16. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 2.3 million common shares remained available for repurchase
under the common share repurchase program.

•

Filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2002 a new shelf registration statement that provides for the issuance of up to $1 billion aggregate
amount of debt securities, preferred stock, and common stock from time to time in one or more offerings to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets. The new $1 billion shelf registration statement replaces the $294
million remaining on our previous $700 million shelf registration statement filed in December 1999.

Credit Facilities

United Dominion has four secured revolving credit facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of $860 million and one with
Freddie Mac for $72 million. As of December 31, 2002, $676.3 million was outstanding under the Fannie Mae credit facilities leaving $183.7 million of unused capacity. The Fannie Mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten years, bear
interest at floating and fixed rates, and can be extended for an additional five years at United Dominion’s discretion. As of December 31, 2002, $70.7 million had been funded under the Freddie Mac credit facility leaving $1.3 million of
unused capacity. The Freddie Mac credit facility is for an initial term of five years with an option by United Dominion to extend for an additional four-year term at the then market rate.



As of December
31, 2002, the aggregate borrowings under both the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit facilities was $747 million. We have $305.9 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 6.4%. The remaining balance on these
facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 2.0%.

United Dominion has a $375 million three-year unsecured bank revolving credit facility that matures in August 2003. As of December 31, 2002, $175.8 million was outstanding under the bank credit facility leaving
$199.2 million of unused capacity. Under the bank credit facility, United Dominion may borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.1%, and pays an annual facility fee equal to 0.25% of the commitment.

The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit facilities and the bank
revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. As of December 31, 2002, management believes that United Dominion is in compliance with all covenants and limitations.

Derivative Instruments

As part of United Dominion’s overall interest rate risk
management strategy, we use derivatives as a means to fix the interest rates of variable rate debt obligations or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. United Dominion’s derivative transactions used for interest rate risk management
include various interest rate swaps with indices that relate to the pricing of specific financial instruments of United Dominion. United Dominion believes that it has appropriately controlled its interest rate risk through the use of derivative
instruments. During 2002, the fair value of United Dominion’s derivative instruments has improved from an unfavorable value position of $14.9 million at December 31, 2001 to an unfavorable value position of $9.6 million at
December 31, 2002. This decrease is primarily due to the normal progression of the fair market value of derivative instruments to get closer to zero as they near the end of their terms (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).

Interest Rate Risk

United Dominion is exposed to interest rate risk associated
with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced. United Dominion does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio of
real estate assets. United Dominion’s interest rate sensitivity position is managed by our finance department. Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive
assets and liabilities. United Dominion’s earnings are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact its cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. A large portion of United Dominion’s market risk is exposure to
short-term interest rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under the unhedged portion of its Fannie Mae credit facilities and its bank revolving credit facility, which totaled $370.5 million and $70.7 million, respectively, at December 31,
2002. The impact on United Dominion’s financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2002 was immaterial.

At December 31, 2002, the notional value of United Dominion’s derivative products for the purpose of managing interest rate risk was
$232 million, representing interest rate swaps under which United Dominion pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate. These agreements effectively fix $232 million of United Dominion’s variable rate notes payable to a weighted
average fixed rate of 7.72%. At December 31, 2002, the fair market value of the interest rate swaps was an unfavorable value position of $9.6 million. If interest rates were 100 basis points more or less at December 31, 2002, the fair market value
of the interest rate swaps would have increased or decreased approximately $1.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively.

If market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100 basis points more in 2003 than they did during 2002, United Dominion’s
interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements, would increase, and income before taxes would decrease by $5.3 million. Comparatively, if market interest rates



for variable rate debt had averaged 100 basis points more in 2002 than in 2001, United Dominion’s interest expense, after considering
the effects of its interest rate swap agreements, would have increased, and income before taxes would have decreased by $5.2 million. If market rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points higher at December 31, 2002, the fair value of fixed rate
debt would have decreased from $1.38 billion to $1.33 billion. If market interest rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points lower at December 31, 2002, the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from $1.38 billion to $1.45
billion.

These amounts are determined by
considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on United Dominion’s borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements. These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such
an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible
effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in United Dominion’s financial structure.

Results of Operations

Effective January 1, 2002, United Dominion adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (“SFAS No. 144”), “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets

.” SFAS No. 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 extends the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include the
components of an entity that have either been disposed of or are classified as held for disposition (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). During 2002, United Dominion sold 25 communities, one commercial property, and one parcel of
land and, at December 31, 2002, had five properties classified as real estate held for disposition. Accordingly, the operating results of these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. The following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented.

Net Income Available to Common Shareholders

2002-vs-2001

Net income available to common shareholders was $25.8 million ($0.24 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $27.1
million ($0.27 per share) for the prior year. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders resulted primarily from non-recurring charges incurred during 2002. These consisted primarily of extraordinary charges for prepayment penalties
and premiums paid in connection with the refinancing of mortgage debt and the repurchase of unsecured debt, aggregating $37.0 million before minority interests. These non-recurring charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
as an extraordinary charge to earnings. The increase in extraordinary charges was partially offset by higher gains recognized on the sales of depreciable property during 2002 compared to 2001, most of which are included in income from discontinued
operations (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), and non-recurring charges in 2001 (see discussion that follows under “Restructuring Charges” and “Impairment Loss on Real Estate and Investments”). In addition,
consolidated property operations generated $9.0 million more in rental income during 2002 compared to 2001 as a result of the continued lease-up and stabilization of development communities, and interest expense decreased $11.4 million due to
refinancing activities.

2001-vs-2000

Net income available to common shareholders
was $27.1 million ($0.27 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $42.7 million ($0.41 per share) for 2000, representing a decrease of $15.6 million ($0.14 per share). Excluding non-recurring charges (see discussion that
follows under “Restructuring Charges” and “Impairment Loss on Real Estate and Investments”) and extraordinary items, net



income available to common shareholders was $41.5 million ($0.41 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $45.5
million ($0.44 per share) for 2000, representing a decrease of $4.0 million ($0.04 per share). Excluding non-recurring charges and extraordinary items, the decrease for the period was primarily due to the overall decrease in United
Dominion’s portfolio of assets that generated rental income of $618.6 million, representing a decrease of $8.0 million from 2000. In addition, United Dominion recognized lower gains on the sale of land and depreciable property during 2001 and
incurred the write-off of unamortized original issuance costs associated with its 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock during the second quarter of 2001. This decrease was moderated, in part, by a decrease in rental expenses of
$4.2 million to $246.2 million and lower interest costs of $144.4 million during 2001 compared to $156.0 million in 2000.

Apartment Community Operations

United Dominion’s net income is primarily generated from the operation of its apartment communities. The following table summarizes
the operating performance of United Dominion’s total apartment portfolio for each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

*

Excludes depreciation, amortization, and property management expenses.

**

Based upon weighted average homes.

The increase in property operating income provided by the same communities, development communities, and acquisition communities since
December 31, 2001 is primarily due to the continued lease-up and stabilization of development communities.

2002-vs-2001

Same Communities

United
Dominion’s same communities (those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to January 1, 2001 and held on January 1, 2002, which consisted of 66,416 apartment homes at December 31, 2002) provided 87% of our property operating
income for the year ended December 31, 2002.

In
2002, same community property operating income decreased 0.8% or $2.8 million compared to the prior year. The overall decrease in property operating income was primarily driven by a 17.1% or $5.6 million increase in vacancy loss and a 37.1% or $4.5
million increase in concessions. These decreases in income were partially offset by a 32.8% or $3.4 million increase in sub-meter, trash, and vacant utility reimbursements, a 0.3% or $1.7 million increase in rental rates and a 13.0% or $2.6
million increase in other income. Physical occupancy declined 0.8% to 93.3% in 2002 compared to 2001.

For 2002, property operating expenses at these same communities increased 0.9% or $1.7 million compared to 2001. This increase in property
operating expenses was primarily driven by a 10.6% or $3.3 million increase in repairs and maintenance costs and a 3.4% or $1.6 million increase in real estate taxes, both of which were partially offset by a 5.1% or $1.7 million decrease in
utilities expense, a 40.2% or $0.9 million decrease in incentive compensation expense, and a 9.5% or $1.0 million decrease in insurance costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property operating
income divided by property rental income) decreased 0.4% to 63.3%.



Non-Mature
Communities

The remaining 13% of United
Dominion’s property operating income during 2002 was generated from its non-mature communities (those communities acquired or developed during 2001 and 2002, sold properties, and those properties classified as real estate held for disposition).
The 16 communities with 4,989 apartment homes acquired by United Dominion during 2001 and 2002 provided $19.6 million of property operating income. In addition, United Dominion’s development communities, which included 1,238 apartment homes
constructed since January 1, 2001, provided $6.7 million of property operating income during 2002. The 25 communities with 6,990 apartment homes sold during 2002 provided $18.1 million of property operating income, the two communities with 363
apartment homes classified as real estate held for disposition provided $1.9 million of property operating income, and other non-mature communities provided $4.6 million of property operating income for the year ended December 31, 2002.

2001-vs-2000

Same Communities

United Dominion’s same communities (those communities acquired, developed, or stabilized prior to January 1, 2000 and held on January
1, 2001, which consisted of 72,997 apartment homes at December 31, 2001) provided 95% of United Dominion’s property operating income for the year ended December 31, 2001.

In 2001, property operating income for the same communities increased 2.3% or $8.5 million compared to 2000.
The growth in property operating income resulted from a $17.8 million or 3.1% increase in property rental income over the same period in the prior year. The increase was driven by a $22.9 million or 3.9% increase in rental rates. The increased
rental rates were partially offset by higher concessions and an increase in bad debt expense. Physical occupancy decreased 0.2% to 94.0% in 2001 compared to 2000.

For 2001, property operating expenses at these same communities increased $9.3 million or 4.5% compared to
2000. The increase in property operating expenses resulted primarily from a $3.6 million or 11.1% increase in utility costs experienced by United Dominion as a result of the increase in prices for natural gas and overall increases in electricity
costs. In addition, United Dominion experienced a $2.4 million or 7.3% increase in repairs and maintenance, a $1.6 million or 3.1% increase in taxes, and a $1.2 million or 2.1% increase in personnel costs compared to 2000.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental
income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property operating income divided by property rental income) decreased 0.5% to 63.2%.

Non-Mature Communities

The remaining 5% of United Dominion’s property operating income during 2001 was generated from its non-mature communities (those
communities acquired or developed during 2000 and 2001 and sold properties). The six communities with 1,571 apartment homes acquired by United Dominion during 2000 and 2001 provided an additional $3.8 million of property operating income during
2001. In addition, United Dominion’s development communities, which included 2,022 apartment homes constructed since January 1, 2000, provided an additional $9.5 million of property operating income for the year ended December 31, 2001, and the
nine communities with 1,889 apartment homes sold in 2001 provided $2.5 million of property operating income during 2001.

Real Estate Depreciation

During the year ended December 31, 2002, real estate depreciation on both continuing and discontinued operations increased $7.3 million or
4.8% compared to 2001. The increase in depreciation expense was attributable to the overall increase in the weighted average number of apartment homes as well as the impact of completed development communities, acquisitions, and capital
expenditures.



During the
year ended December 31, 2001, real estate depreciation on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased $1.1 million or 0.8% compared to 2000. The decrease in depreciation expense was attributable to the overall decrease in the weighted
average number of apartment homes partially offset by the impact of completed development communities, acquisitions, and capital expenditures.

Interest Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased $11.4 million or 7.9% from
2001 primarily due to debt refinancings and decreasing interest rates that were partially offset by the overall increase in the weighted average level of debt outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the weighted average amount of debt
outstanding increased 2.0% or $40.4 million from 2001 levels and the weighted average interest rate decreased from 7.1% to 6.1% for 2002. The weighted average amount of debt employed during 2002 is higher than 2001 as we borrowed additional funds to
acquire apartment communities. The decrease in the average interest rate during 2002 reflects the ability of United Dominion to take advantage of declining interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of variable rate debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, interest expense
decreased $11.7 million from the corresponding amount in 2000 primarily due to decreasing interest rates and, to a lesser extent, the overall decrease in the level of debt outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the weighted average
amount of debt outstanding decreased 2.9% or $60.2 million from 2000 levels and the weighted average interest rate decreased from 7.6% in 2000 to 7.1% in 2001. The weighted average amount of debt employed during 2001 is lower as a portion of
disposition proceeds was used to repay outstanding debt. The decrease in the average interest rate during 2001 reflects the ability of United Dominion to take advantage of declining interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of variable
rate debt.

Restructuring Charge

In 2001, management undertook a comprehensive review of the
organizational structure of United Dominion and its operations subsequent to the appointment of a new senior management team and CEO. As a result, we recorded $4.5 million of expense related to the termination of approximately 10% of United
Dominion’s workforce in operations and at the corporate headquarters. In addition, United Dominion recognized expense in the aggregate of $0.9 million related to relocation costs associated with the new executive offices in Colorado and other
miscellaneous costs.

Impairment Loss on Real Estate and
Investments

In 2002, United Dominion
pursued its strategy of exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and the redeployment of capital would enhance future growth rates and economies of scale. During 2002, United Dominion sold 25 apartment communities with a total of
6,990 apartment homes, one commercial property, and one parcel of land with an aggregate net book value of approximately $285 million. Although these sales resulted in an aggregate net gain of $31.5 million, certain of these assets were sold at net
selling prices below their net book values. As a result, United Dominion recorded an aggregate $2.3 million impairment loss during 2002 for the write down of a portfolio of apartment communities in Memphis, Tennessee.

In 2001, in connection with the evaluation of United
Dominion’s real estate assets and operations, senior management determined that it was in our best interest to dispose of a majority of United Dominion’s undeveloped tracts of land at an accelerated pace and redeploy the proceeds
elsewhere. This represented a change from prior management in the holding period of these assets and their respective values. Prior management had purchased these tracts of land in 1999 and 2000 with the intent to build apartment communities on
them. To accelerate the disposition of these undeveloped land sites, we recorded an aggregate $2.8 million impairment loss during the first quarter of 2001 for the write down of seven undeveloped sites in selected markets. The $2.8 million
charge represented the discount necessary to dispose of these assets in a short time frame coupled with decreases in market value in 2001 for these properties. In addition, United Dominion recognized a $0.4 million charge for the write down of
its investment in an online apartment leasing company.



During the
fourth quarter of 2001, Realeum, Inc., a property management software venture in which United Dominion made significant investments prior to 2001, successfully completed an equity offering in which it raised approximately $15 million of new capital
in exchange for a 45.6% ownership stake. As a result of the equity offering, the market value of United Dominion’s ownership stake was established at approximately $1.3 million, and its $3.5 million aggregate investment was adjusted to
$1.3 million.

General and Administrative

For the year ended December 31, 2002, general and
administrative expenses decreased $2.4 million or 11.0% compared to 2001. The decrease was primarily due to reduced personnel costs and state and local taxes that were partially offset by increased third-party consulting expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, general and
administrative expenses increased $6.0 million or 38.2% compared to 2000. The increase was primarily due to an increase in costs related to incentive compensation, employee benefits, and state and local taxes.

Gains on Sales of Land and Depreciable Property

For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, United
Dominion recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of $32.7 million and $24.7 million, respectively. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of United Dominion’s divestiture activity
from period to period, as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold.

Inflation

United Dominion believes that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. Substantially all of United Dominion’s leases are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our risk
from the adverse effects of inflation.

Factors Affecting Our
Business Prospects

There are may factors
that affect our business and the results of our operations, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:

•

Unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions that could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates.

•

The failure of acquisitions to achieve anticipated results.

•

Possible difficulty in selling apartment communities.

•

Competitive factors that may limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents.

•

Insufficient cash flow that could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk.

•

Failure to generate sufficient revenue, which could impair our debt service payments and distributions to shareholders.

•

Development and construction risks that may impact our profitability.

•

Our failure to succeed in new markets.

•

Changing interest rates, which could increase interest costs and affect the market price of our securities.

•

Potential liability for environmental contamination, which could result in substantial costs.

•

The imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year.

assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.

There have been no significant changes in our internal
controls or in other factors, which could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of this evaluation.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.” As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed its method of accounting for derivative financial instruments.

DECEMBER 31, 2002

1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and formation

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., a Virginia corporation,
was formed in 1972. United Dominion operates within one defined business segment with activities related to the ownership, management, development, acquisition, renovation, and disposition of multifamily apartment communities nationwide. At December
31, 2002, United Dominion owned 260 communities with 74,480 completed apartment homes and had three communities with 616 apartment homes under development.

Basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of United Dominion and its subsidiaries, including United Dominion
Realty, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”), and Heritage Communities, L.P. (the “Heritage OP”), (collectively, “United Dominion”). As of December 31, 2002, there were 100,984,826 units in the Operating Partnership
outstanding, of which 94,616,256 units or 93.7% were owned by United Dominion and 6,368,570 units or 6.3% were owned by non-affiliated limited partners. As of December 31, 2002, there were 3,492,889 units in the Heritage OP outstanding, of which
3,115,471 units or 89.2% were owned by United Dominion and 377,418 units or 10.8% were owned by non-affiliated limited partners. The consolidated financial statements of United Dominion include the minority interests of the unitholders in the
operating partnerships. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Income taxes

United Dominion is operated as, and elects to be taxed as, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Generally, a REIT complies with the provisions of the Code if it meets certain requirements concerning its income and assets, as well as if it distributes at least 90% (95% prior to 2001) of its REIT
taxable income to its shareholders and will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes if it distributes at least 100% of its income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes. However, United Dominion is subject to certain
state and local excise or franchise taxes, for which provision has been made.

The differences between net income available to common shareholders for financial reporting purposes and taxable income before dividend deductions relate primarily to temporary differences, principally
real estate depreciation and the tax deferral of certain gains on property sales. The differences in depreciation result from differences in the book and tax basis of certain real estate assets and the differences in the methods of depreciation and
lives of the real estate assets.

The following
table reconciles United Dominion’s net income to REIT taxable income for the three years ended December 31, 2002

(dollars in thousands)

:



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2002

For income
tax purposes, distributions paid to common shareholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains and return of capital, or a combination thereof. For the three years ended December 31, 2002, distributions declared per common share were taxable as
follows:

Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to
amounts in prior years’ financial statements to conform with current year presentation.

Real estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recorded impairment losses.

Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for
improvements, renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the value of the existing asset will be materially enhanced or
the life of the related asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life expectancy.

United Dominion recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when there is an event or change in circumstance that
indicates an impairment in the value of an asset and the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the asset’s carrying value. If such indicators of impairment are present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess
of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties classified as real estate held for
disposition generally represent properties that are under contract for sale. Real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less the cost to dispose, determined on an asset by asset
basis. Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance costs on held for disposition properties are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to held for disposition properties are
capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for disposition.



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2002

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which is 35 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures, equipment, and
other assets.

All development projects and
related carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Real estate under development.” As each building in a project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the total cost of the building is
transferred to real estate held for investment and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The cost of development projects includes interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development overhead during the
construction period.

Interest, real estate
taxes, and incremental labor and support costs for personnel working directly on the development site are capitalized as part of the real estate under development to the extent that such charges do not cause the carrying value of the asset to exceed
its net realizable value. During 2002, 2001, and 2000, total interest capitalized was $0.9 million, $2.9 million, and $3.6 million, respectively.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.

Restricted cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders
for real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and security deposits.

Deferred financing costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and other external costs incurred to obtain debt financings and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over a period not to exceed the
term of the related debt. Unamortized financing costs are written-off when debt is retired before its maturity date. During 2002, 2001, and 2000, amortization expense was $4.5 million, $3.6 million, and  $5.0 million, respectively.

Investments in unconsolidated development joint ventures

Investments in unconsolidated joint
ventures are accounted for using the equity method when major business decisions require approval by the other partners and United Dominion does not have control of the assets. Investments are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in
net income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions. United Dominion eliminates intercompany profits on sales of services that are provided to the venture. Differences between the carrying value of investments and the underlying equity in net
assets of the investee are due to capitalized interest on the investment balance and capitalized development and leasing costs that are recovered by United Dominion through fees during construction (see Note 4—Investment in Unconsolidated
Development Joint Venture).

Revenue recognition

United Dominion’s apartment homes are
leased under operating leases with terms generally of one year or less. Rental income is recognized after it is earned and collectibility is reasonably assured.

DECEMBER 31, 2002

Advertising costs

All advertising costs are expensed as
incurred and reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item “Administrative and marketing.” During 2002, 2001, and 1999, total advertising expense was $11.0 million, $9.6 million, and $9.3 million, respectively.

Interest rate swap agreements

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
and 138,

“Accounting for

Certain Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

became effective on January 1, 2001. The accounting standards require companies to carry all derivative instruments, including certain embedded
derivatives, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of
hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, all of United Dominion’s derivative financial instruments are interest rate swap agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges of debt with variable interest
rate features and are qualifying hedges for financial reporting purposes. For derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other
comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings during the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present
value of future cash flows of the hedged item, if any, is recognized in current earnings during the period of change. The adoption of Statements 133 and 138 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative effect of an accounting change of a $3.8
million loss, all of which was recorded directly to other comprehensive income.

As part of United Dominion’s overall interest rate risk management strategy, we use derivative financial instruments as a means to artificially fix variable rate debt or to hedge anticipated
financing transactions.  United Dominion’s derivative transactions used for interest rate risk management include various interest rate swaps with indices that relate to the pricing of specific financial instruments of United Dominion.
Because of the close correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying cash flow exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the cash flow of the underlying exposures.
As a result, United Dominion believes that it has appropriately controlled the risk so that derivatives used for interest rate risk management will not have a material unintended effect on consolidated earnings. United Dominion does not enter into
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

The fair value of United Dominion’s derivative instruments is reported on balance sheet at their current fair value. Estimated fair values for interest rate swaps rely on prevailing market interest rates. These fair value
amounts should not be viewed in isolation, but rather in relation to the values of the underlying hedged transactions and investments and to the overall reduction in exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates. Each interest rate swap
agreement is designated with all or a portion of the principal balance and term of a specific debt obligation. The interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments over the life of the related agreements. Amounts received or paid on the
interest rate swaps are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to the related interest expense of the outstanding debt based on the accrual method of accounting. The related amounts payable to and receivable from counterparties are included
in other liabilities and other assets, respectively.



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2002

Prior to
the adoption of Statements 133 and 138 on January 1, 2001, United Dominion also used interest rate swap contracts for hedging purposes. For interest rate swaps, the net amounts paid or received and net amounts accrued through the end of the
accounting period were included in interest expense. The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and unrealized gains or losses were not recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Gains and losses on any contracts terminated early were deferred and amortized to income over the remaining average life of the terminated contract.

Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in equity during each period except for those resulting from investments by or
distributions to shareholders, is displayed in the accompanying Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. Other comprehensive income consists of gains or losses from derivative financial instruments.

Stock-based compensation

United Dominion has elected to follow the intrinsic value
method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”

(“APB 25”) in accounting for its employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under
Statement 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”

requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of United
Dominion’s employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation cost has been recognized.

Minority interests in operating partnerships

Interests in operating partnerships held by limited partners are represented by operating partnership units (“OP Units”). The
operating partnerships’ income is allocated to holders of OP Units based upon net income available to common shareholders and the weighted average number of OP Units outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units outstanding during the
period. Capital contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to minority interests in accordance with the terms of the individual partnership agreements. OP Units can be exchanged for cash or shares of United Dominion’s
common stock on a one-for-one basis, at the option of United Dominion. OP Units, as a percentage of total OP Units and shares outstanding, was 6.2% at December 31, 2002 and 6.8% at December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Minority interests in other partnerships

United Dominion has limited partners in certain real estate
partnerships acquired in certain merger transactions. Net income for these partnerships is allocated based on the percentage interest owned by these limited partners in each respective real estate partnership.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per common share is computed based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based upon common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive stock options and other potentially dilutive common stock
equivalents. The dilutive effect of stock options and other potentially dilutive common stock equivalents is determined using the treasury stock method based on United Dominion’s average stock price.

The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earning per share

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

The
effect of the conversion of the operating partnership units and convertible preferred stock is not dilutive and is therefore not included as a dilutive security in the earnings per share computation. The weighted average effect of the conversion of
the operating partnership units for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 was 6,999,384 shares, 7,281,835 shares, and 7,489,435 shares, respectively. The weighted average effect of the conversion of the convertible preferred stock for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 was 12,307,692 shares.

Impact of recently issued accounting standards

In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Correction” (“SFAS No. 145”). Statement 4, “Reporting
Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt” (“SFAS No. 4”), required that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that were included in the determination of net income be aggregated and, if material, classified as an
extraordinary item. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 will require United Dominion to reclassify prior period items into continuing operations, including those recorded in the current period, that do not meet the
extraordinary classification. Additionally, future gains and losses related to debt extinguishment may be required to be classified in income from continuing operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 become
effective in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. United Dominion, from time to time, incurs such charges and is currently assessing the impact that this statement will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation

, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure

Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.

” This statement requires that a liability for the fair value of a guarantee be recognized
at the time the obligation is undertaken. The statement also requires that the liability be measured over the term of the related guarantee. This statement is effective for all guarantees entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002. For all
guarantees entered into prior to December 31, 2002, there is to be no change in accounting; however, disclosure of management’s estimate of its future obligation under the guarantee is to be made. As of December 31, 2002, management estimates
that its likelihood of funding its guarantor obligations is remote and the impact to United Dominion would be immaterial.

The

(dollars in thousands):

United
Dominion is pursuing its strategy of exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and the redeployment of capital would enhance future growth rates and economies of scale. During the first quarter of 2002, United Dominion placed nine
assets, with an aggregate net book value of $89.3 million, under contract for sale and reclassified them as real estate held for disposition. These sales closed in the second quarter of 2002 and resulted in our withdrawal from Naples, Florida;
Tucson, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; and substantially all of Memphis, Tennessee. Although these sales resulted in an aggregate net gain of $11.5 million, certain of these assets were sold at net selling prices below their net book values at March
31, 2002. As a result, United Dominion recorded an aggregate $2.3 million impairment loss during the first quarter for the write down of a portfolio of five apartment communities in Memphis, Tennessee.

During the first quarter of 2001, management performed an
analysis of the carrying value of all undeveloped land parcels in connection with United Dominion’s plans to accelerate the disposition of these sites. As a result, an aggregate $2.8 million impairment loss was recognized on seven undeveloped
sites in selected markets. An impairment loss was indicated as a result of the net book value of the assets being greater than the estimated fair market value less the cost of disposal.

During the second quarter of 2000, management transferred approximately $197 million of assets from real
estate held for disposition to real estate held for investment and, as a result, approximately $10 million in depreciation expense was recognized on the communities transferred in order to reflect depreciation on these properties while they were
classified in real estate held for disposition. Furthermore, approximately $5 million of additional depreciation expense was recognized on these assets during 2000 subsequent to their transfer to real estate held for investment. Depreciation expense
in 2000 was further increased by the impact of over $150 million in development completions in late 1999 and 2000 and approximately $200 million in acquisitions and capital improvements in 1999 and 2000.

3.    INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

United Dominion adopted SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”

as of January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 144 requires, among other things, that the
primary assets and liabilities and the results of operations of United Dominion’s real properties which have been sold during 2002, or are held for disposition at December 31, 2002, be classified as discontinued operations and segregated in
United Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets. Properties classified as real estate held for disposition generally represent properties that are under contract for sale and are expected to close within the next
twelve months. United Dominion’s adoption of SFAS No. 144 resulted in the presentation of the net operating results of those properties sold or transferred to held for disposition from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002, as discontinued
operations for all periods presented. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have an impact on net income available to common shareholders. SFAS No. 144 only resulted in the reclassification of the operating results of the properties sold or
transferred to held for disposition during 2002 within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000.

During 2002, United Dominion sold 25 communities with a total of 6,990 apartment homes, one parcel of land, and one commercial property
with 143,000 square feet. At December 31, 2002, United Dominion had two communities with 363 apartment homes with a net book value of $13.6 million, two parcels of land with a net book value of $6.9 million, and one commercial property with a net
book value of $1.8 million included in real estate held for disposition. The results of operations for these properties are classified on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the line item entitled “Income from discontinued operations,
net of minority interests.”

4.    INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED DEVELOPMENT JOINT VENTURE

In June 2000, United Dominion completed the formation of a joint venture that would invest approximately $101 million to develop five
apartment communities with a total of 1,438 apartment homes. United Dominion owned a 25% interest in the joint venture and served as the managing partner. Prior to establishing the joint venture, United Dominion commenced construction on all five of
the projects. Upon closing of the venture in June 2000, United Dominion contributed the projects in return for its equity interest of approximately $8 million in the venture and was reimbursed for approximately $35 million of development outlays
that were incurred prior to closing the joint venture. We recognized fee income for services provided by United Dominion to the joint venture, to the extent of the outside partner’s interest, of approximately $0.6 million, $2.6 million, and
$3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. In December 2001, United Dominion purchased three of the five apartment communities with 794 apartment homes for a total aggregate cost of approximately $61
million. In June 2002, United Dominion purchased the remaining two apartment communities with 644 apartment homes for approximately $52 million. United Dominion’s interest in the gains on the sale of these properties by the joint venture to
United Dominion was recorded as a reduction of its basis in the assets and; therefore, is not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fixed Rate
Debt

Mortgage notes
payable

.    Fixed rate mortgage notes payable are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest and mature at various dates from January 2004 through June 2034 and carry interest rates ranging from 6.66% to
8.50%.

Tax-exempt secured notes
payable

.    Fixed rate mortgage notes payable that secure tax-exempt housing bond issues mature at various dates through November 2025 and carry interest rates ranging from 6.09% to 7.90%. Interest on these notes is generally

revolving secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae. The Fannie Mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten years, bear interest at floating and fixed rates, and can be extended for an additional five years at United Dominion’s
discretion. In order to limit a portion of its interest rate exposure, United Dominion has two interest rate swap agreements associated with the Fannie Mae credit facilities. These agreements have an aggregate notional value of $17.0 million under
which United Dominion pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate on the notional amount. The interest rate swap agreements effectively change United Dominion’s interest rate exposure on $17.0 million of secured debt from a
variable rate to a weighted average fixed rate of 6.74%.

For the
year ended December 31, 2002, United Dominion recognized $18.4 million ($0.17 per diluted share) of extraordinary losses as a result of prepayment penalties incurred from the refinancing of certain secured loans, using proceeds from the Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac credit facilities and the early payoff of loans on the sale of properties. For the year ended December 31, 2001, United Dominion recognized $3.2 million ($0.03 per diluted share) of extraordinary losses related to prepayment
penalties for the early payoff of loans on the sale of properties. These prepayment penalties were funded by proceeds of the new credit facilities, proceeds from the related asset sales, and from the release of cash escrows retained by former
lenders of $14.0 million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(a)

United Dominion has a $375 million three-year unsecured bank revolving credit facility that matures in August 2003. As of December 31, 2002, $175.8 million was
outstanding under the bank credit facility leaving $199.2 million of unused capacity. Under the bank credit facility, United Dominion may borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.1% and pays a facility fee, which is equal to 0.25% of the commitment. The
bank credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. As of December 31, 2002, management believes that United Dominion is in compliance with all covenants and limitations.

The following is a summary of short-term bank borrowings under
United Dominion’s bank credit facility at December 31, (dollars in thousands):

At December 31, 2002,
United Dominion had five interest rate swap agreements associated with commercial bank borrowings with an aggregate notional value of $105 million under which United



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2002

Dominion paid a fixed rate of interest and received a variable rate of interest on the notional amounts. The interest rate swaps, which
mature in August 2003 and July 2004, effectively change United Dominion’s interest rate exposure on the $105 million of borrowings from a variable rate to a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 7.47%. At December 31, 2002, 2001, and
2000, the weighted average interest rate of commercial borrowings, after giving effect to swap agreements, was 5.6%, 6.1%, and 7.5%, respectively.

(b)

As of December 31, 2002, United Dominion had five interest rate swap agreements associated with borrowings under the term loan with an aggregate notional value of
$100 million under which United Dominion pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate of interest on the notional amounts. The interest rate swaps, which mature in May 2003 and May 2004, effectively change United Dominion’s
interest rate exposure on these borrowings from a variable rate to a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 8.17%.

(c)

United Dominion has one interest rate swap agreement associated with these unsecured notes with an aggregate notional value of $10 million under which United
Dominion pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate on the notional amount. The interest rate swap agreement, which matures in  January 2003, effectively changes United Dominion’s interest rate exposure on the $10 million
from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 7.65%.

(d)

Payable annually in three equal principal installments of $7.4 million.

(e)

In June 2002, United Dominion issued $200 million of 6.50% senior unsecured notes due in June 2009. The net proceeds of $198.5 million from the sale were used to
reduce outstanding debt under United Dominion’s $375 million unsecured revolving credit facility.

(f)

Includes an investor put feature that grants a one-time option to redeem the debentures in September 2004.

(g)

Includes $1.5 million and $3.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, of deferred gains from the termination of interest rate risk management

7.    SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Preferred Stock

The Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (Series B)
has no stated par value and a liquidation preference of $25 per share. With no voting rights and no stated maturity, Series B is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not convertible into any other securities of United
Dominion. The Series B is not redeemable prior to May 29, 2007. On or after this date, the Series B may be redeemed for cash at the option of United Dominion, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid
dividends. The redemption price is payable solely out of the sale proceeds of other capital stock of United Dominion. All dividends due and payable on the Series B have been accrued or paid as of the end of each fiscal year.

The Series D Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (Series D)
has no stated par value and a liquidation preference of $25 per share. The Series D has no voting rights, no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption, and is convertible into 1.5385 shares of common stock at the
option of the holder of the Series D at any time at $16.25 per share. United Dominion has the right to cause the holder of the Series D

to convert the Series D to common shares at $16.25 based on twenty trading days at or above $17.06 for the life of the security. United
Dominion has the right to purchase 2 million shares of the Series D in accordance with a predetermined schedule, provided that the volume weighted average price of our common shares is $16.25 for a twenty day trading period. The repurchase price
payable will be computed in accordance with the table below, expressed as a percentage of the liquidation preference, determined by the period in which the Series D repurchase date occurs, together with all accrued and unpaid dividends to and

least equals the conversion price, initially set at $16.25 per share. The redemption is payable solely out of the sale proceeds of other capital stock. In addition, United Dominion may not redeem, in any consecutive twelve-month period, a number of
shares of Series D having an aggregate liquidation preference of more than $100 million.

On June 15, 2001, United Dominion completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25 per share plus accrued dividends.

Officers’ Stock Purchase and Loan Plan

As of December 31, 2002, United Dominion has $2.6 million of
notes receivable from certain officers and directors of United Dominion (original principal balances of $3.0 million), at an interest rate of 7.0% that mature between June 2004 and October 2005. The purpose of the loans was for the borrowers to
purchase shares of United Dominion’s common stock pursuant to United Dominion’s 1991 Stock Purchase and Loan Plan. The loans are evidenced by promissory notes between the borrowers and United Dominion and are secured by a pledge of the
shares of common stock (241,750 shares with a market value of $4.0 million at December 31, 2002). The notes require that dividends received on the shares be applied towards payment of the notes.

In addition, United Dominion entered into a Servicing and
Purchase Agreement (the “Servicing Agreement”) with Sun Trust Bank (the “Bank”) whereby United Dominion has agreed to act as servicing agent for and to purchase certain loans made by the Bank to officers and directors of
United Dominion (the “Borrowers”) to finance the purchase of shares of United Dominion’s common stock. The loans are evidenced by promissory notes (“Notes”) between each Borrower and the Bank. The Servicing Agreement
provides that the Bank can require United Dominion to purchase the Notes upon an event of default by the Borrower or United Dominion under the Servicing Agreement and at certain other times during the term of the Servicing Agreement. The aggregate
outstanding principal balance of the Notes as of December 31, 2002 was $11.1 million (original principal balance was $11.7 million), and all of the Notes mature during 2004. Because certain of the Borrowers elected floating rate loans and others
elected fixed rate loans, the interest rates on these loans as of December 31, 2002 ranged from 3.63% to 7.68%. Each Borrower entered into a Participation Agreement with United Dominion that requires that all cash dividends received on the shares
(1,037,998 shares at December 31, 2002 with a closing market value of $17.0 million) be applied towards payment of the Notes. Based upon the fact that 100% of all cash dividend payments are paid to amortize the Notes and that the Notes are recourse
to the Borrowers, United Dominion believes that its exposure to liability under the Notes is remote.

Dividend Reinvestment
and Stock Purchase Plan

United
Dominion’s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows common and preferred shareholders the opportunity to purchase, through the reinvestment of cash dividends, additional shares of United
Dominion’s common stock. As of December 31, 2002, 9,590,060 shares of common stock had been issued under the Stock Purchase Plan. Shares in the amount of 4,409,940 were reserved for further issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan at December 31,
2002. During 2002, 152,343 shares were issued under the Stock Purchase Plan for a total consideration of approximately $2.5 million.

Restricted Stock Awards

United Dominion’s 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) authorizes the granting of restricted stock awards to employees,
officers, and directors of United Dominion. The total restricted stock awards under the LTIP may not exceed 15% of the total number of available shares, or 600,000. Deferred compensation expense is recorded over the vesting period and is based upon
the value of the common stock on the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2002, 440,601 shares of restricted stock have been issued under the LTIP.

Shareholder Rights Plan

United Dominion’s 1998 Shareholder Rights Plan is intended to protect long-term interests of shareholders in the event of an
unsolicited, coercive, or unfair attempt to take over the company. The plan authorized a dividend of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (the “Rights) on each share of common stock outstanding. Each Right, which is not currently exercisable,
will entitle the holder to purchase 1/1,000 of a share of a new series of United Dominion’s preferred stock, to be designated as Series C Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, at a price to be determined upon the occurrence of the
event, and for which the holder must be paid $45 should the take over occur. Under the Plan, the rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires more than 15% of United Dominion’s common stock, or announces a tender offer that would
result in the ownership of 15% of United Dominion’s common stock.

8.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by United Dominion using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret

rate secured debt approximates fair value at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The carrying amounts of United Dominion’s borrowings under variable rate unsecured debt arrangements, short-term revolving credit agreements, and lines of credit
approximate their fair values at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Derivative financial instruments

The following table presents the fair values of United Dominion’s derivative financial instruments outstanding, based on external market quotations, as of December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands):

For the

UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2002

Dominion’s hedging instruments. In addition, United Dominion has recognized $9.6 million of derivative financial instrument liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

As of
December 31, 2002, United Dominion expects to reclassify $7.7 million of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings (interest expense which, combined with the interest paid on the underlying debt,
results in interest expense at the fixed rates shown above) during the next twelve months on the related hedged transactions.

Risk of counterparty non-performance

United Dominion has not obtained collateral or other security to support financial instruments. In the event of non-performance by the
counterparty, United Dominion’s credit loss on its derivative instruments is limited to the value of the derivative instruments that are favorable to United Dominion at December 31, 2002, of which we have none. However, such non-performance is
not anticipated as the counterparties are highly rated credit quality U.S. financial institutions and management believes that the likelihood of realizing material losses from counterparty non-performance is remote.

9.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Profit Sharing Plan

The United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan
(the “Plan”) is a defined contribution plan covering all eligible full-time employees. Under the Plan, United Dominion makes discretionary profit sharing and matching contributions to the Plan as determined by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors. Aggregate provisions for contributions, both matching and discretionary, which are included in United Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 were $0.9
million, $0.7 million, and $1.3 million, respectively.

Stock
Option Plan

In May 2001, the shareholders
of United Dominion approved the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”), which supersedes the 1985 Stock Option Plan. With the approval of the LTIP, no additional grants will be made under the 1985 Stock Option Plan. The LTIP authorizes
the granting of awards which may take the form of options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards, any other right or interest relating to common stock or cash.
The Board of Directors reserved 4 million shares for issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards under the LTIP. Of the 4 million shares reserved, 3.4 million shares are for stock-based awards, such as stock options, with the remaining
600,000 shares reserved for restricted stock awards. The LTIP generally provides, among other things, that options are granted at exercise prices not lower than the market value of the shares on the date of grant and that options granted must
be exercised within ten years. The maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued subject to incentive stock options is 10 million shares. Shares under options that expire or are cancelable are available for subsequent grant.

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per
share is required by Statement 123

“Accounting for

Stock-Based Compensation”

(“SFAS No. 123”), and has been determined as if United Dominion had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method
of accounting as defined in SFAS No. 123. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for 2002, 2001, and 2000:

share options had exercise prices between $9.63 and $10.88.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, stock-based awards for 3,149,350 and 3,278,500 shares of common stock, respectively, were available for future grants under the 1999 LTIP’s existing authorization and no option shares were
available for future grants under the 1985 Stock Option Plan.

10.    RESTRUCTURING

CHARGES

During the first quarter of 2001, United Dominion announced the appointment of a new chief executive officer and senior management
structure. The new management team began a comprehensive review of the organizational structure of United Dominion and its operations. As a result of this review, United Dominion recorded a charge of $5.4 million related to workforce reductions and
other miscellaneous costs. These charges are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item “Severance costs and other organizational charges.” All charges came under consideration subsequent to the appointment
of United Dominion’s new CEO in February 2001 and were approved by management and the Board of Directors in March 2001. All of the $5.4 million charge was paid during 2001.

The planned workforce reductions resulted in a charge of $4.5 million during the first quarter of 2001 and in
the planned termination of approximately 200 full-time equivalent positions, or 10% of total staffing in corporate functions, including senior management and general and administrative functions, and in apartment operations. Employee termination
benefits included severance packages and related benefits and outplacement services for employees terminated. United Dominion also recognized $0.4 million related to relocation costs associated with the new executive offices in Denver and $0.5
million related to other miscellaneous costs.

In
addition, management performed an analysis of the carrying value of all undeveloped land parcels in connection with United Dominion’s plans to accelerate the disposition of these sites. As a result, an aggregate $2.8 million impairment loss was
recognized on seven undeveloped sites in selected markets. An impairment loss was indicated as a result of the net book value of the assets being greater than the estimated fair market value less the cost of disposal. United Dominion also recognized
a $0.4 million charge for the write down of its investment in an online apartment leasing company.

UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

Dominion incurred $2.0 million, $2.3 million, and $2.6 million of rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Contingencies

Out-Performance Program

In May 2001, the shareholders of United Dominion approved the Out-Performance Program (the “Program”) pursuant to which
executives and other key officers of United Dominion were given the opportunity to invest in United Dominion by purchasing performance shares (“Out-Performance Partnership Shares” or “OPPSs”) of the Operating Partnership for an
initial investment of $1.27 million (the full market value of the OPPSs at inception, as determined by an independent investment banking firm). The Program measures United Dominion’s performance over a 28-month period beginning February 2001.

The Program is designed to provide participants
with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment if United Dominion’s total return, considering the reinvestment of dividend income as well as share price appreciation, on its common stock during the measurement period exceeds
the greater of (a) industry average (defined as the total cumulative return of the Morgan Stanley REIT Index over the same period) or (b) a 30% total return (12% annualized) (the “minimum return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if United
Dominion’s total return satisfies these criteria, the holders of the OPPSs will receive distributions and allocations of income and loss from the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and allocations that would be received on the
number of interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) obtained by:

i.

determining the amount by which the cumulative total return of United Dominion’s common stock over the measurement period exceeds the greater of the cumulative
total return of the peer group index (the Morgan Stanley REIT Index) or the minimum return (such being the “excess return”);

ii.

multiplying 4% of the excess return by United Dominion’s market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares and OP Units outstanding over the
28-month period multiplied by the daily closing price of United Dominion’s common stock) up to a maximum of 2% of market capitalization; and

iii.

dividing the number obtained in (ii) by the market value of one share of United Dominion common stock on the valuation date, determined by the volume-weighted
average price of the common stock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the valuation date.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of United Dominion’s common stock does not meet the minimum return or the
total return of the peer group and there is no excess return, then the holders of the OPPSs



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2002

will forfeit their entire initial investment of $1.27 million. The OPPSs, unlike United Dominion’s other OP Units, are not convertible
into common stock except upon a change of control of United Dominion or upon the death of the participant. It is this feature, combined with the fact that management paid market value for the shares, that we believe makes this program better than
previous programs, such as stock options, that were likewise designed to motivate and retain executives and key management. It ensures that management’s goals are perpetually aligned with the shareholders since the OP Units can not be conveyed
or disposed of except as outlined previously. Accordingly, the contingently issuable OPPSs are not included in common stock and common stock equivalents in the calculation of earnings per share. Based upon results through December 31, 2002,
1,578,534 OPPSs would have been issued had the Program terminated on that date. However, since the ultimate determination of OPPSs to be issued will not occur until June 2003, and the number of OPPSs is determinable only upon future events, the
financial statements do not reflect any additional impact for these events.

Legal Matters

United Dominion and its subsidiaries are engaged in various litigations and have a number of unresolved claims pending. The ultimate liability in respect of such litigations and claims cannot be determined at this time.
United Dominion is of the opinion that such liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, is not likely to be material in relation to the consolidated financial statements of United Dominion.

12.    INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

United Dominion owns and operates multifamily apartment
communities throughout the United States that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment units to a diverse base of tenants. United Dominion separately evaluates the performance of each of its apartment
communities. However, because each of the apartment communities has similar economic characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants, the apartment communities have been aggregated into a single apartment communities segment. All segment
disclosure is included in or can be derived from United Dominion’s consolidated financial statements.

There are no tenants that contributed 10% or more of United Dominion’s total revenues during 2002, 2001, or 2000.
