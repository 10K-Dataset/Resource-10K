EXPLANATORY
    NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 of UDR, Inc. a
    Maryland corporation, and United Dominion Realty, L.P., a
    Delaware limited partnership, of which UDR is the parent company
    and sole general partner. Unless the context otherwise requires,
    all references in this Report to “we,” “us,”
    “our,” the “Company”, “UDR” or
    UDR, Inc. refer collectively to UDR, Inc., together with its
    consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, including the
    Operating Partnership. Unless the context otherwise requires,
    the references in this Report to the “Operating
    Partnership” refer to United Dominion Realty, L.P. together
    with its consolidated subsidiaries. “Common stock”
    refers to the common stock of UDR and “stockholders”
    means the holders of shares of UDR’s common stock and
    preferred stock. The limited partnership interests of the
    Operating Partnership are referred to as
    “OP Units” and the holders of the OP Units
    are referred to as “unitholders”. This combined

Form 10-K

is being filed separately by UDR and the Operating Partnership.

There are a number of differences between our company and our
    operating partnership, which are reflected in our disclosure in
    this report. UDR is a real estate investment trust (a
    “REIT”), whose most significant asset is its ownership
    interest in the Operating Partnership. UDR also conducts
    business through other subsidiaries and operating partnerships,
    including its subsidiary
    RE


,

    which focuses on development, land entitlement and short-term
    hold investments. UDR does not conduct business itself, other
    than by acting as the sole general partner of the Operating
    Partnership, holding interests in other operating partnerships,
    subsidiaries and joint ventures, issuing securities from time to
    time and guaranteeing debt of certain of our subsidiaries. The
    Operating Partnership conducts the operations of a substantial
    portion of the business and is structured as a partnership with
    no publicly traded equity securities. The Operating Partnership
    has guaranteed certain outstanding securities of UDR.

As of December 31, 2010, UDR owned 110,883 units of
    the general partnership interests of the Operating Partnership
    and 174,736,557 units (or approximately 97.2%) of the
    limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership (the
    “OP Units”). UDR conducts a substantial amount of
    its business and holds a substantial amount of its assets
    through the Operating Partnership, and, by virtue of its
    ownership of the OP Units and being the Operating
    Partnership’s sole general partner, UDR has the ability to
    control all of the

day-to-day

operations of the Operating Partnership. Separate financial
    statements and accompanying notes, as well as separate
    discussions under “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
    “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
    Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchasers of Equity
    Securities” and “Controls and Procedures” are
    provided for each of UDR and the Operating Partnership. In
    addition, certain disclosures in “Business” are
    separated by entity to the extent that the discussion relates to
    UDR’s business outside of the Operating Partnership.

Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

UDR is a self administered real estate investment trust, or
    REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and
    manages apartment communities in select markets throughout the
    United States. At December 31, 2010, our consolidated
    apartment portfolio included 172 communities located in 23
    markets, with a total of 48,553 completed apartment homes, which
    are held through our operating partnerships, including the
    Operating Partnership and Heritage Communities L.P., our
    subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we
    have an ownership interest in 37 communities containing 9,891
    completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures.

At December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership’s
    consolidated apartment portfolio included 81 communities located
    in 19 markets, with a total of 23,351 completed apartment homes.
    The Operating Partnership owns, acquires, renovates, develops,
    redevelops, manages, and disposes of multifamily apartment
    communities generally located in high

barrier-to-entry

markets located in the United States. The high

barrier-to-entry

markets are characterized by limited land for new construction,
    difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive
    single-family home prices and significant employment growth
    potential. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010,
    revenues of the Operating Partnership represented approximately
    55% of our total rental revenues.

UDR elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as
    the “Code”. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must
    continue to meet certain tests which, among other things,
    generally require that our assets consist primarily of real
    estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate
    assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable
    income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders
    annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject
    to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our
    net income to the extent we distribute such



net income to our stockholders annually. In 2010, we declared
    total distributions of $0.730 per common share and paid
    dividends of $0.725 per common share.

UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003,
    we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland.
    The Operating Partnership was formed in 2004 as Delaware limited
    partnership. The Operating Partnership is the

successor-in-interest

to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed
    under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations in 1995.
    Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive,
    Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado and our telephone
    number is

(720) 283-6120.

Our website is located at

www.udr.com

.

As of February 17, 2011, we had 1,547 full-time
    associates and 85 part-time associates, all of whom were
    employed by UDR.

Reporting
    Segments

We report in two segments: Same Communities and Non-Mature/Other
    Communities. Our Same Communities segment includes those
    communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to
    January 1, 2009, and held as of December 31, 2010.
    These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and
    operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there
    is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and
    the community is not held for disposition within the current
    year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy
    once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive
    months. Our Non-Mature/Other Communities segment includes those
    communities that were acquired or developed in 2008, 2009 or
    2010, sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition, condominium
    conversion properties, joint venture properties, properties
    managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of
    mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our
    operating segments, see Note 15 to UDR’s consolidated
    financial statements and Note 12 to the Operating
    Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.

Business
    Objectives

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic
    returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders
    with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve
    this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following
    goals and strategies:

•

own and operate apartments in markets that have the best growth
    prospects based on favorable job formation and low home
    affordability, thus enhancing stability and predictability of
    returns to our stockholders;

•

manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to
    buying, selling, renovating, and developing apartment
    communities;

•

empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently
    and effectively;

•

measure and reward associates based on specific performance
    targets; and

•

manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of
    earnings and dividends.



    Highlights

•

We acquired five operating communities with 1,374 homes located
    in Orange County, California; Baltimore, Maryland; Los Angeles,
    California; and Boston, Massachusetts for $412 million. We
    also acquired a land parcel located in San Francisco,
    California for $23.6 million.

•

We acquired an interest in a joint venture with Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”) for
    $100.8 million. The joint venture owns 26 operating
    communities with 5,748 homes and 11 parcels of land with the
    potential to develop approximately 2,300 additional homes. The
    majority of the portfolio is comprised of mid/high-rise
    buildings located in urban, in-fill locations. The assets are
    located in many of our core markets with rent and quality levels
    at the top of each market.

•

We completed the development of four wholly-owned communities
    with 1,575 homes at a total cost of $259.7 million.

•

We completed the development of one community (274 apartment
    homes) held by a consolidated joint venture for a total cost of
    $122.3 million.

•

We repaid $187.3 million of secured debt and
    $50 million of maturing medium-term unsecured notes. The
    $187.3 million of secured debt includes $70.5 million
    for a maturing construction loan held by one of our consolidated
    joint ventures, repayment of $52.7 million of credit
    facilities and $64.1 million of mortgage payments.

•

We repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $29.2 million for $29.4 million resulting in a loss on
    extinguishment of $1 million, which includes the write off
    of related deferred finance charges. The unsecured debt
    repurchased by the Company matures in 2011. As a result of this
    repurchase, the loss is represented as an addition to interest
    expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

•

We closed on a $250 million, five-year unsecured term loan
    facility of which $100 million was swapped into a fixed
    rate of 3.76% and $150 million has rate of LIBOR plus
    200 basis points.

•

In 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Distribution
    Agreement with respect to the issue and sale by us from time to
    time of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or
    More From Date of Issue. In February 2010, we issued
    $150 million of 5.25% senior unsecured medium-term
    notes under the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement.
    These notes were priced at 99.46% of the principal amount at
    issuance and the unamortized discount was $519,000 at
    December 31, 2010.

•

In 2009, we initiated an “At the Market” equity
    distribution program pursuant to which we may sell up to
    15,000,000 shares of Common Stock from time to time to or
    through sales agents, by means of ordinary brokers’
    transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market
    prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the
    applicable agent. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    we sold 6,144,367 shares of Common Stock through this
    program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
    $110.8 million at a weighted average price per share of
    $18.04. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting
    related expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents
    of approximately $2.2 million, were approximately
    $108.6 million.

•

We initiated an underwritten public offering to sell
    16,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $20.35 per
    share. We granted the underwriters a

30-day

option to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of
    Common Stock to cover overallotments, if any. We sold
    18,400,000 shares of Common Stock in this offering for
    aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $374.4 million at
    a price of $20.35 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from the
    offering, after deducting related expenses were approximately
    $359.2 million.

Other than the following, there were no significant changes to
    the Operating Partnership’s business during 2010 (the above
    2010 highlights relate to UDR or other subsidiaries of UDR):

•

On September 30, 2010, the Operating Partnership guaranteed
    certain outstanding securities of UDR, such that the Operating
    Partnership, as primary obligor and not merely as surety,
    irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the
    applicable securities and to the trustee and their



successors and assigns under the respective indenture
    (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at
    stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all
    obligations of UDR under the respective indenture whether for
    principal of or interest on the securities (and premium, if
    any), and all other monetary obligations of UDR under the
    respective indenture and the terms of the applicable securities
    and (b) the full and punctual performance within the
    applicable grace periods of all other obligations of UDR under
    the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable
    securities.

Our
    Strategies and Vision

We previously announced our vision to be the innovative
    multifamily public real estate investment trust of choice. We
    identified the following strategies to guide decision-making and
    growth:

1. Strengthen our portfolio

2. Continually improve operations

3. Maintain access to low-cost capital

Strengthen
    our Portfolio

We are focused on increasing our presence in markets with
    favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability,
    and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing.
    Portfolio decisions consider internal analyses and third-party
    research, taking into account job growth, multifamily permitting
    and housing affordability.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 55.7%
    of our same store net operating income was provided by our
    communities located in California, Metropolitan
    Washington, D.C., Oregon and Washington state.

Operating
    Partnership Strategies and Vision

The Operating Partnership’s long-term strategic plan is to
    achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer,
    more concentrated markets. As a result, the Operating
    Partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities
    located in California, Metropolitan Washington D.C. and the
    Washington state markets over the past years. Prospectively, we
    plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets
    we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns.
    Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including
    favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability
    and favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

During 2010, in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our
    portfolio, we acquired five operating communities with 1,374
    apartment homes for approximately $412 million.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•

population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall
    potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
    environment of the community in which the property is located;

•

geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment,
    transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver
    significant economies of scale;

•

construction quality, condition and design of the community;

•

current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability
    to increase cash flow;

•

potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•

ability to increase the value and profitability of the property
    through operations and redevelopment;

•

terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent
    increases;

•

occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar
    type in the vicinity;



•

prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing
    of the property; and

•

competition from existing multifamily communities and the
    potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in
    the area.

We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and
    performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding
    whether to dispose of a property include:

•

current market price for an asset compared to projected
    economics for that asset;

•

potential increases in new construction in the market area;

•

areas where the economy is not expected to grow substantially;

•

markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term
    concentration; and

•

operating efficiencies.

During 2010, we sold one 149 apartment home community. This
    apartment home community was not owned by the Operating
    Partnership.

    acquisitions, apartment community dispositions and our

Redevelopment
    Activities

During 2010, we continued to redevelop properties in targeted
    markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add
    value. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred
    $30.8 million in major renovations, which include major
    structural changes

and/or

architectural revisions to existing buildings.

Joint
    Venture Activities

In 2010, we completed the development of an apartment community
    located in Bellevue, Washington with 274 apartment homes,
    45,394 square feet of retail space and a carrying value of
    $122.3 million. On October 16, 2009, our partner in
    the joint venture (“Elements Too”) in this property
    resigned as managing member and appointed us as managing member.
    In addition, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture. As a result of
    UDR’s control of the joint venture, we were required to
    consolidate the joint venture. On December 30, 2009, we
    entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49%
    interest in Elements Too for $3.2 million, which was paid
    in 2010. At closing, our interest in Elements Too increased to
    98%.

We are a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“989 Elements”) which owns and operates a
    23-story, 166 home high-rise apartment community in the central
    business district of Bellevue, Washington. At closing, UDR owned
    49% of the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $11.8 million. On December 31, 2009, our partner
    resigned as managing member and appointed us as managing member.
    In addition, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture. Concurrently,
    we entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase its
    49% interest in 989 Elements for $7.7 million, which was
    paid in 2010. At closing, our interest in 989 Elements increased
    to 98%.

We are a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Bellevue Plaza”) which owns an operating
    retail site in Bellevue, Washington. We initially planned to
    develop a 430 home high rise apartment building with ground
    floor retail on an existing operating retail center. However,
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, the joint venture
    decided to continue to operate the retail property as opposed to
    developing a high rise apartment building on the site. On
    December 30, 2009, our partner relinquished its voting
    rights and approval rights and its ability to substantively
    participate in the decision-making process of the joint venture.
    Our partner also resigned as managing member and appointed us as
    managing member. Concurrently, we entered into an agreement with
    our partner to purchase its 49% interest in Bellevue Plaza for
    $5.2 million, which was paid in 2010. At closing, our
    interest in Bellevue Plaza increased from 49% to 98%.

    ventures, see Note 5,

Joint Ventures

to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements of UDR, Inc. included in this
    Report.

In November 2010, we acquired The Hanover Company’s
    (“Hanover”) partnership interests in the
    Hanover/MetLife Master Limited Partnership (the
    “UDR/MetLife Partnership”). The UDR/MetLife
    Partnership owns a portfolio of 26 operating communities
    containing 5,748 homes and 11 land parcels with the
    potential to develop approximately 2,300 additional homes. Under
    the terms of the UDR/MetLife Partnership, we will act as the
    general partner and earn fees for property and asset management
    and financing transactions. We acquired ownership interests of
    12.27% in the operating communities and 4.14% in the land
    parcels for $100.8 million. Our initial investment of
    $100.8 million consists of $71.8 million in cash,
    which includes associated transaction costs, and a
    $30 million payable (includes discount of $1 million)
    to Hanover. We agreed to pay the $30 million balance to
    Hanover in two interest free installments in the amounts of
    $20 million and $10 million on the first and second
    anniversaries of the closing, respectively. Our investment at
    December 31, 2010 was $122.2 million.

In October 2010, the Company entered into a venture with an
    affiliate of Hanover to develop a 240 apartment home
    community in the metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts area. At the
    closing and at



December 31, 2010, UDR owned a noncontrolling interest of
    95% in the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $10 million and our investment at December 31, 2010
    was $10.3 million.

During 2009, we and an unaffiliated third party formed a joint
    venture for the investment of up to $450 million in
    multi-family properties located in key, high barrier to entry
    markets. The partners will contribute equity of
    $180 million of which our maximum equity will be 30% or
    $54 million when fully invested. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the joint venture acquired its first
    property (151 homes) located in Metropolitan Washington D.C. for
    $43.1 million. At closing and at December 31, 2010, we
    owned 30% of the joint venture. Our investment at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $5.2 million and
    $242,000, respectively.

The Operating Partnership is not a party to any of the joint
    venture activities described above.

Continually
    Improve Operations

We continue to make progress on automating our business as a way
    to drive operating efficiencies and to better meet the changing
    needs of our residents. Since its launch in January 2009, our
    residents have been utilizing the resident internet portal on
    our website. Our residents have access to conduct business with
    us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to pay rent on line
    and to submit service requests. In July 2010, we completed the
    roll out of online renewals throughout our entire portfolio. As
    a result of transforming operations through technology our
    residents get the convenience they want and our operating teams
    have become more efficient. These improvements in adopting the
    web as a way to conduct business with us have also resulted in a
    decline in marketing and advertising costs, improved cash
    management, and improved capabilities to better manage pricing
    of our available apartment homes.

In 2010, we launched an enhanced

www.udr.com

website along and a new Modern Living website that highlights
    our premier urban-style location communities. Both UDR.com and
    Modern Living feature innovative

point-of-view

walking tours (at select locations), social media content
    sharing and a new “save to favorites” feature that
    entices first-time visitors to revisit www.udr.com. In addition
    to improvements to www.udr.com, we also increased our suite of
    mobile and tablet device offerings with the addition of an iPad,
    Android, BlackBerry and Palm Pre apartment search applications.
    These overall enhancements have contributed to increasing our
    web visitor traffic to over 2.3 million visitors (up 24%)
    and almost 1.5 million organic search engine visitors (up
    30%) which contributed to a 20%

year-over-year

lead stream increase.

Maintaining
    Access to Low-Cost Capital

We seek to maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek,
    and not just react to, opportunities available in the
    marketplace. We have structured our borrowings to stagger our
    debt maturities and to be able to opportunistically access both
    secured and unsecured debt.

Special
    Dividend

On November 5, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend on a pre-adjusted basis of $1.29 per share (“the
    Special Dividend”). The Special Dividend was paid on
    January 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on
    December 9, 2008. The dividend represented our fourth
    quarter recurring distribution of $0.33 per share and an
    additional special distribution of $0.96 per share due to
    taxable income arising from our dispositions occurring during
    the year. Subject to our right to pay the entire Special
    Dividend in cash, stockholders had the option to make an
    election to receive payment in cash or in shares, however, the
    aggregate amount of cash payable to stockholders, other than
    cash payable in lieu of fractional shares, would not be less
    than $44.0 million.

The Special Dividend, totaling $177.1 million, was paid on
    137,266,557 shares issued and outstanding on the record
    date. Approximately $133.1 million of the Special Dividend
    was paid through the issuance of 11,358,042 shares of
    common stock, which was determined based on the volume weighted
    average closing sales price of our common stock of $11.71 per
    share on the NYSE on January 21, 2009 and January 22,
    2009. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board’s (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
    Update

2010-01,

Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components
    of Stock and Cash

(“ASU

2010-01”),



which considers distributions that contain components of cash
    and stock and allows shareholders to select their preferred form
    of distribution as a stock dividend. Such a distribution is
    treated as a stock issuance on the date the dividend is paid. At
    December 31, 2008, we accrued $133.1 million of
    distribution payable related to the Special Dividend. ASU

2010-01

is
    effective for the Company on December 15, 2009 and should
    be applied on a retrospective basis. As a result, we reversed
    the effect of the issuance of additional shares of common stock
    pursuant to the Special Dividend, which was retroactively
    reflected in each of the historical periods presented within the
    Company’s

Form 8-K

filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the
    “SEC” on May 22, 2009, and effectively issued
    these shares on January 29, 2009 (the payment date of the
    Special Dividend).

Financing
    Activities

As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we
    utilized proceeds from debt and equity offerings and
    refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt and
    acquire apartment communities. The following is a summary of our
    major financing activities in 2010:

•

repaid $187.3 million of secured debt and
    $50.0 million of maturing medium-term unsecured notes. The
    $187.3 million of secured debt includes $70.5 million
    for a maturing construction loan held by one of our consolidated
    joint ventures, repayment of $52.7 million of credit
    facilities and $64.1 million of mortgage payments;

•

repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $29.2 million for $29.4 million resulting in a loss on
    extinguishment of $1 million, which includes the write off
    of related deferred finance charges. The unsecured debt
    repurchased by us matures in 2011. As a result of this
    repurchase, the loss is represented as an addition to interest
    expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations;

•

closed on a $250 million, five-year unsecured term loan
    facility of which $100 million was swapped into a fixed
    rate of 3.76% and $150 million has a rate of LIBOR plus
    200 basis points;

•

in 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Distribution
    Agreement with respect to the issue and sale by us from time to
    time of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or
    More From Date of Issue. In February 2010, we issued
    $150 million of 5.25% senior unsecured medium-term
    notes under the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement.
    These notes were priced at 99.46% of the principal amount at
    issuance and had a discount of $519,000 at December 31,
    2010;

•

in 2009, we initiated an “At the Market” equity
    distribution program pursuant to which we may sell up to
    15,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time to or
    through sales agents, by means of ordinary brokers’
    transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market
    prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the
    applicable agent. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    we sold 6,144,367 shares of common stock through this
    program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
    $110.8 million at a weighted average price per share of
    $18.04. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting
    related expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents
    of approximately $2.2 million, were approximately
    $108.6 million;

•

in 2010, we initiated an underwritten public offering to sell
    16,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.35
    per share. We granted the underwriters a

30-day

option to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of
    common stock to cover overallotments, if any. We sold
    18,400,000 shares of common stock in this offering for
    aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $374.4 million at
    a price of $20.35 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from the
    offering, after deducting related expenses were approximately
    $359.2 million; and

•

on September 30, 2010, the Operating Partnership guaranteed
    certain outstanding securities of UDR, such that the Operating
    Partnership, as primary obligor and not merely as surety,
    irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the
    applicable securities and to the trustee and their successors
    and assigns under the respective indenture (a) the full and
    punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by
    acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of UDR under the
    respective indenture whether for principal of or interest on the
    securities (and premium, if any), and all other monetary
    obligations of UDR under the respective indenture and the terms
    of the applicable securities



and (b) the full and punctual performance within the
    applicable grace periods of all other obligations of UDR under
    the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable
    securities.

Markets
    and Competitive Conditions

At December 31, 2010, 55.7% of our consolidated same store
    net operating income and 76% of the Operating Partnership’s
    same store net operating income was generated from apartment
    homes located in California, Metropolitan Washington D.C.,
    Oregon, and Washington state. We believe that this
    diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases
    the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and
    economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability
    of our earnings.

Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of
    our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our
    communities do not have. Competing communities can use
    concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive
    advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer
    than our communities. The competitive position of each community
    is different depending upon many factors including

sub-market

supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors
    compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop
    new properties. These competitors include insurance companies,
    pension and investment funds, public and private real estate
    companies, investment companies and other public and private
    apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or
    lower capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete
    effectively for residents and investments. We believe our
    competitive advantages include:

•

a fully integrated organization with property management,
    development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and
    financing expertise;

•

scalable operating and support systems, which include automated
    systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents
    and to effectively focus on our Internet marketing efforts;

•

purchasing power;

•

geographic diversification with a presence in 23 markets across
    the country; and

•

significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us
    to be a local operating expert.

Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease
    management, improved expense control, increased resident
    retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans
    tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of
    operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in
    targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform,
    should position us for continued operational improvement in
    spite of the difficult economic environment.

Communities

At December 31, 2010, our apartment portfolio included 172
    consolidated communities having a total of 48,553 completed
    apartment homes and an additional 930 apartment homes under
    development, which included the Operating Partnership’s
    apartment portfolio of 81 consolidated communities having a
    total of 23,351 completed apartment homes. The overall quality
    of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract
    residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more
    likely to absorb expenses, such as water and sewer costs, from
    the landlord to the resident. In addition, it potentially
    reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home, and
    therefore should result in increased cash flow in the future.

Same
    Store Community Comparison

We believe that one pertinent qualitative measurement of the
    performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same
    store community’s net operating income (“NOI”),
    which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding
    property management and other operating expenses. Our same store
    community population are operating communities which we own and
    have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the
    beginning of the prior year.



For the year ended December 31, 2010, our same store NOI
    decreased by $6.2 million or 1.7% compared to the prior
    year. The decrease in NOI for the 40,699 apartment homes which
    make up the same store population was driven by a decrease in
    rental rates and an increase in expenses which was partially
    offset by increased occupancy.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Operating
    Partnership’s same store NOI decreased by $6.0 million
    or 2.7% compared to the prior year. The decrease in NOI for the
    22,104 apartment homes which make up the same store population
    was driven by a decrease in revenue rental rates and increase in
    operating expenses which was partially offset by increased
    occupancy.

Revenue growth in 2011 may be impacted by general adverse
    conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates,
    increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other
    factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.

Tax
    Matters

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To
    continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain
    tests that, among other things, generally require that our
    assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be
    derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we
    distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than
    net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we
    maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be
    subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level
    on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed
    to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as
    a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state
    and local taxes on our income and property.

We may utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries to engage in activities
    that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the
    provision of management and other services to third parties and
    the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions.
    Taxable REIT subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular
    corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and
    local income taxes.

The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership
    for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating
    Partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur
    federal income tax liability. However, any state or local
    revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the
    operating activities of the Operating Partnership are incurred
    at the entity level.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation
    primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities
    and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a
    term of one year or less, which generally enables us to
    compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on
    our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy
    and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and
    their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this
    has had a material impact on our results for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

Environmental
    Matters

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing
    operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include
    those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials
    in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and
    notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active
    underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management
    activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could
    subject us to a government enforcement action

and/or

claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental
    protection regulations has not had a material effect on our
    capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have
    a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of
    the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports
    have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition,
    all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to



acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified
    environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior
    to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it
    is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal
    all environmental liabilities, or that some material
    environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some
    cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive
    acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of
    hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been
    unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not
    believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale
    abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through
    professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos,
    lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a
    relatively conservative posture toward accepting known
    environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential
    liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential
    housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential
    residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
    hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such
    notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the
    communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in
    that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint
    are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any
    such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by
    children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our
    properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a
    material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.
    We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we
    are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance,
    liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in
    connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that
    the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental
    laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us
    or our financial condition or results of operations. Future
    environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may
    require additional remediation of existing conditions that are
    not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements
    are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could
    have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our
    communities, with limits of liability customary within the
    industry to insure against liability claims and related defense
    costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary
    within the industry, against the risk of direct physical damage
    in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis
    for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including
    loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

There are many factors that affect our business and our results
    of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The
    following is a description of important factors that may cause
    our actual results of operations in future periods to differ
    materially from those currently expected or discussed in
    forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to
    our financial results, operations and business prospects.

Risks
    Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Our
    Operations

Unfavorable Apartment Market and Economic Conditions Could
    Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels, Rental Revenues and the Value
    of Our Real Estate Assets.

Unfavorable market
    conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable
    economic conditions generally may significantly affect our
    occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of
    the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or



dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable
    terms. Our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is
    adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily
    market and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy,
    which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses
    and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, the
    downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and
    uncertainty about the future. Some of our major expenses,
    including mortgage payments and real estate taxes, generally do
    not decline when related rents decline. We would expect that
    declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues

and/or

the
    values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less
    cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our
    stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial
    condition and the market value of our securities. Factors that
    may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues,

and/or

the
    value of our properties include the following, among others:

•

downturns in the national, regional and local economic
    conditions, particularly increases in unemployment;

•

declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing
    more affordable;

•

government or builder incentives which enable first time
    homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative
    housing options more attractive;

•

local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or
    reduced demand for, apartment homes;

•

declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may
    make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;

•

changes in market rental rates;

•

the timing and costs associated with property improvements,
    repairs or renovations;

•

declines in household formation; and

•

rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating
    rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to
    offset increases in operating costs.

Continued Economic Weakness Following the Economic Recession
    that the U.S. Economy Recently Experienced May Materially
    and Adversely Affect our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The U.S. economy continues to
    experience weakness following a severe recession, which has
    resulted in increased unemployment, decreased consumer spending
    and a decline in residential and commercial property values.
    Although the U.S. economy has emerged from the recession,
    high levels of unemployment have persisted. If the economic
    recovery slows or stalls, we may experience adverse effects on
    our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our
    properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Substantial International, National and Local Government
    Spending and Increasing Deficits May Adversely Impact Our
    Business, Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The values of, and the cash flows
    from, the properties we own are affected by developments in
    global, national and local economies. As a result of the recent
    recession and the significant government interventions, federal,
    state and local governments have incurred record deficits and
    assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial
    institutions or other private entities. These increased budget
    deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state
    and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending,
    tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest
    rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events,
    which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Risk of Inflation/Deflation.

Substantial
    inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative
    effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. Neither
    inflation nor deflation has materially impacted our operations
    in the recent past. The general risk of inflation is that our
    debt interest and general and administrative expenses increase
    at a rate higher than our rental rates. The predominant effects
    of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction.
    Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain
    financing or refinancing for our properties. High unemployment
    may have a negative effect on our occupancy levels and our
    rental revenues.



We Are Subject to Certain Risks Associated with Selling
    Apartment Communities, Which Could Limit Our Operational and
    Financial Flexibility.

We periodically dispose of
    apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic
    objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult
    to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. We cannot
    predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the
    price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other
    terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to
    us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a
    willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.
    Furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct
    defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold.
    These conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties
    and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our
    strategic objectives, which may in turn have a materially
    adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value
    of our securities. We are also subject to the following risks in
    connection with sales of our apartment communities:

•

a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property
    sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to
    qualify as like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the
    “Code,” so that any related capital gain can be
    deferred for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may
    not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated
    from our property sales; and

•

federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of
    communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this
    limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market
    conditions are favorable.

Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease Apartment Homes
    or Increase or Maintain Rents.

Our apartment
    communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in
    attracting residents, including other apartment communities,
    condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner
    occupied single-and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in a
    particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease
    apartment homes and increase or maintain rents.

We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of Past or Future
    Acquisitions, and the Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities
    and New Personnel Successfully Could Create
    Inefficiencies.

We have selectively acquired in
    the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we
    intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment
    communities that meet our investment criteria. Our acquisition
    activities and their success are subject to the following risks:

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on
    favorable terms or at all;

•

even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from
    the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required
    principal and interest payments on the acquisition;

•

even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment
    community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after
    incurring certain acquisition-related costs;

•

we may incur significant costs and divert management attention
    in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential
    acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are
    subsequently unable to complete;

•

an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we
    expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure
    related to the acquired property may go undetected during our
    due diligence procedures;

•

when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional
    amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability,
    and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated
    improvements in profitability; and

•

we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired
    apartment communities and new personnel into our existing
    operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such
    apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies
    that could adversely affect our expected return on our
    investments and our overall profitability.



We do not expect to acquire apartment communities at the rate we
    have in prior years, which may limit our growth and have a
    material adverse effect on our business and the market value of
    our securities. In the past, other real estate investors,
    including insurance companies, pension and investment funds,
    developer partnerships, investment companies and other public
    and private apartment REITs, have competed with us to acquire
    existing properties and to develop new properties, and such
    competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to
    pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms,
    which could adversely affect growth.

Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our
    Profitability.

In the past we have selectively
    pursued the development and construction of apartment
    communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate
    opportunities arise. Development activities have been, and in
    the future may be, conducted through wholly owned affiliated
    companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties.
    Our development and construction activities are subject to the
    following risks:

•

we may be unable to obtain construction financing for
    development activities under favorable terms, including but not
    limited to interest rates, maturity dates

and/or

loan
    to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even
    abandon potential developments;

•

we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining,
    necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other
    required governmental permits and authorizations, which could
    result in increased development costs, could delay initial
    occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community,
    and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with
    respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits
    or authorizations;

•

yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in
    completing projects, costs that exceed budget

and/or

higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents
    than pro forma;

•

if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the
    development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable
    financing for the developments, our development capacity may be
    limited;

•

we may abandon development opportunities that we have already
    begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already
    incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;

•

we may be unable to complete construction and

lease-up

of
    a community on schedule, or incur development or construction
    costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable
    to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such
    costs;

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may
    fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and
    economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our
    profitability goals for that community; and

•

when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we
    developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or
    construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the
    limits of our insurance.

In some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired
    communities exceeded our original estimates. We may experience
    similar cost increases in the future. Our inability to charge
    rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any
    increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Bankruptcy of Developers in Our Development Joint Ventures
    Could Impose Delays and Costs on Us With Respect to the
    Development of Our Communities and May Adversely Affect Our
    Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The bankruptcy of one of the
    developers in any of our development joint ventures could
    materially and adversely affect the relevant property or
    properties. If the relevant joint venture through which we have
    invested in a property has incurred recourse obligations, the
    discharge in bankruptcy of the developer may require us to honor
    a completion guarantee and therefore might result in our
    ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations
    than we would otherwise bear.

Property Ownership Through Joint Ventures May Limit Our
    Ability to Act Exclusively in Our Interest.

We
    have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire
    properties in joint ventures with other persons



or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of
    such structures. If we use such a structure, we could become
    engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture
    partners that might affect our ability to operate a
    jointly-owned property. Moreover, joint venture partners may
    have business, economic or other objectives that are
    inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that
    relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or
    refinancing of a property. In some instances, joint venture
    partners may have competing interests in our markets that could
    create conflicts of interest.

Some Potential Losses May Not Be Adequately Covered by
    Insurance.

We have a comprehensive insurance
    program covering our property and operating activities. We
    believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these
    policies are adequate and appropriate. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be
    adequately covered under our insurance program. In addition, we
    will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured
    retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess
    of applicable coverage.

If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits
    occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have
    invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future
    revenue from the property. In such an event, we might
    nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other
    financial obligations related to the property. Material losses
    in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. If one
    or more of our significant properties were to experience a
    catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations,
    delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild
    the property. Such events could adversely affect our cash flow
    and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our
    Growth.

We have acquired in the past, and we may
    acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise,
    apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets.
    Entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks,
    and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets.
    These risks include, among others:

•

inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market
    conditions and local economies;

•

inability to hire and retain key personnel;

•

lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting
    procedures; and

•

inability to achieve budgeted financial results.

Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could
    Result in Substantial Costs.

Under various
    federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or
    former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to
    investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of
    currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic
    substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or
    responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our
    current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. In
    addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or
    to third parties for property damage and for investigation and

clean-up

costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs
    could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws
    create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure
    their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to
    properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially
    and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent
    an affected property.

In addition, our properties are subject to various federal,
    state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including
    laws governing the management of wastes and underground and
    aboveground storage tanks. Noncompliance with these
    environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to
    liability. Changes in laws could increase the potential costs of
    compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or
    increase liability for noncompliance. This may result in
    significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise
    materially and adversely affect our operations.

As the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur
    liability based on various building conditions. For example,
    buildings and other structures on properties that we currently
    own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future
    contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing
    material, or ACM. Environmental, health and safety laws require
    that ACM be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines
    or penalties on owners, operators or employers for
    non-compliance with those requirements.



These requirements include special precautions, such as removal,
    abatement or air monitoring, if ACM would be disturbed during
    maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially
    resulting in substantial costs. In addition, we may be subject
    to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as
    a result of exposure to ACM or releases of ACM into the
    environment.

We cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a
    result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to
    make distributions to our shareholders, or that such costs or
    liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

Our Properties May Contain or Develop Harmful Mold or Suffer
    from Other Indoor Air Quality Issues, Which Could Lead to
    Liability for Adverse Health Effects or Property Damage or Cost
    for Remediation.

When excessive moisture
    accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth
    may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains
    undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some
    molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air
    quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation,
    chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other
    biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria.
    Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged
    to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms,
    including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence
    of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our
    properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation
    program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne
    contaminants or to increase ventilation. In addition, the
    presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants
    could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if
    property damage or personal injury occurs.

Compliance or Failure to Comply with the Americans with
    Disabilities Act of 1990 or Other Safety Regulations and
    Requirements Could Result in Substantial
    Costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act
    generally requires that public buildings, including our
    properties, be made accessible to disabled persons.
    Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the
    federal government or the award of damages to private litigants.
    From time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect
    to some of our properties under this Act. If, under the
    Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make
    substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more
    of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it
    could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local
    regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life
    safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these
    requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We
    do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether
    compliance with future requirements will require significant
    unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and
    results of operations.

Real Estate Tax and Other Laws.

Generally we
    do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance
    with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property
    tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in
    income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. These
    costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability
    to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance
    with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential
    liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or
    the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or
    (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws
    regulating housing, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act
    and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, may result in
    significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely
    affect funds from operations and the ability to make
    distributions to stockholders.

Risk of Damage from Catastrophic Weather
    Events.

Certain of our communities are located in
    the general vicinity of active earthquake faults, mudslides and
    fires, and others where there are hurricanes, tornadoes or risks
    of other inclement weather. The adverse weather events could
    cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels.
    In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could
    lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as
    anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also
    continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or
    other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could
    materially and adversely affect our business and our financial
    condition and results of operations.



Actual or Threatened Terrorist Attacks May Have an Adverse
    Effect on Our Business and Operating Results and Could Decrease
    the Value of Our Assets.

Actual or threatened
    terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
    Attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment
    communities could significantly affect our ability to operate
    those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our
    expected results. Further, our insurance coverage may not cover
    all losses caused by a terrorist attack. In addition, the
    adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future
    attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have
    a material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

We May Experience a Decline in the Fair Value of Our Assets
    and Be Forced to Recognize Impairment Charges, Which Could
    Materially and Adversely Impact Our Financial Condition,
    Liquidity and Results of Operations and the Market Price of Our
    Common Stock.

A decline in the fair value of our
    assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such
    assets under GAAP if we were to determine that, with respect to
    any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the
    ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized
    cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we
    would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write
    down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis,
    based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are
    considered to be impaired. Such impairment charges reflect
    non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent
    disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our
    future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference
    between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of
    such assets at the time of sale. If we are required to recognize
    asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could
    materially and adversely affect our financial condition,
    liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price
    of our common stock.

Any Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Stock
    Price.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal
    control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more
    material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
    reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and
    completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have
    an adverse effect on our stock price.

Our Success Depends on Our Senior
    Management.

Our success depends upon the
    retention of our senior management, whose continued service in
    not guaranteed. We may not be able to find qualified
    replacements for the individuals who make up our senior
    management if their services should no longer be available to
    us. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior
    management team could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

We May be Adversely Affected by New Laws and
    Regulations.

The current United States
    administration and Congress have enacted, or called for
    consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues,
    including with respect to health care, financial regulation
    reform, climate control, executive compensation and others. We
    believe that these and other potential proposals could have
    varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to
    material. At this time, we are unable to predict with certainty
    what level of impact specific proposals could have on us.

Certain rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an
    impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as
    contributing to the global financial crisis and the continuing
    economic downturn. These initiatives have created a degree of
    uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate
    industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the
    United States at least since the wave of lawmaking and
    regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the Great
    Depression. The federal legislative response in this area has
    culminated most recently in the enactment on July 21, 2010
    of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
    (“Dodd-Frank Act”). Many of the provisions of the
    Dodd-Frank Act have extended implementation periods and delayed
    effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by
    regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known
    for an extended period of time. The Dodd-Frank Act, including
    future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation
    of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory
    proposals that are proposed or pending in the United States
    Congress, may



limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us,

and/or

intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways
    that are not currently identifiable.

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate
    governance and public disclosure in particular, including
    certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and
    regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for
    public companies like ours and could significantly increase the
    costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public
    markets. Because we are committed to maintaining high standards
    of internal control over financial reporting, corporate
    governance and public disclosure, our management team will need
    to devote significant time and financial resources to comply
    with these evolving standards for public companies. We intend to
    continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both
    existing and evolving standards, and this investment has
    resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general
    and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time
    and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance
    activities.

Changes in the System for Establishing U.S. Accounting
    Standards May Materially and Adversely Affect Our Reported
    Results of Operations.

Accounting for public
    companies in the United States has historically been conducted
    in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as
    in effect in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP is
    established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
    “FASB”), an independent body whose standards are
    recognized by the SEC as authoritative for publicly held
    companies. The International Accounting Standards Board (the
    “IASB”) is a London-based independent board
    established in 2001 and charged with the development of
    International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
    IFRS generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in
    Europe and in developed nations around the world.

IFRS differs in material respects from GAAP. Among other things,
    IFRS has historically relied more on “fair value”
    models of accounting for assets and liabilities than GAAP.
    “Fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation
    of assets and liabilities, often resulting in fluctuations in
    such values as compared to GAAP, which relies more frequently on
    historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation.

The SEC has proposed the mandatory adoption of IFRS by United
    States public companies starting in 2015, with early adoption
    permitted before that date. It is unclear at this time how the
    SEC will propose that GAAP and IFRS be harmonized if the
    proposed change is adopted. In addition, switching to a new
    method of accounting and adopting IFRS will be a complex
    undertaking. We may need to develop new systems and controls
    based on the principles of IFRS. Since these are new endeavors,
    and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately
    adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs associated
    with this conversion are uncertain.

We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of IFRS
    on our financial position and results of operations. Such
    evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity
    regarding the specific IFRS standards that will be adopted.
    Until there is more certainty with respect to the IFRS standards
    to be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our
    conversion to IFRS could have a material adverse impact on our
    reported results of operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Indebtedness and Financings

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and
    Create Refinancing Risk.

We are subject to the
    risks normally associated with debt financing, including the
    risk that our operating income and cash flow will be
    insufficient to make required payments of principal and
    interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our
    line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash
    flow may not be available to make all required principal
    payments and still satisfy UDR’ Inc.’s distribution
    requirements to maintain its status as a REIT for federal income
    tax purposes. In addition, the full limits of our line of credit
    may not be available to us if our operating performance falls
    outside the constraints of our debt covenants. We are also
    likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding
    debt as it matures. We may not be able to refinance existing
    debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as
    the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to
    sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would
    otherwise not choose to do so. In addition, our failure to
    comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to



repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have
    an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs
    and impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt
    Service Payments and Distributions to
    Stockholders.

If our apartment communities do not
    generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses,
    our ability to make required payments of interest and principal
    on our debt securities and to pay distributions to UDR,
    Inc.’s stockholders will be adversely affected. The
    following factors, among others, may affect the net rental
    income generated by our apartment communities:

•

the national and local economies;

•

local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of
    apartment homes;

•

tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience, and
    attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where
    they are located;

•

our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and
    insurance;

•

rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities;

•

competition from other apartment communities;

•

changes in interest rates and the availability of financing;

•

changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of
    compliance; and

•

changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent
    control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing.

Expenses associated with our investment in an apartment
    community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance
    and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when
    circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that
    community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt
    and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could
    sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or
    the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.

Debt Level May Be Increased.

Our current
    debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of
    debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is
    limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We
    manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants,
    but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase
    the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent
    improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.

Financing May Not Be Available and Could Be
    Dilutive.

Our ability to execute our business
    strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt
    financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms
    of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including
    common and preferred equity. We and other companies in the real
    estate industry have experienced limited availability of
    financing from time to time. If we issue additional equity
    securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of
    incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could
    be diluted.

Disruptions in Financial Markets May Adversely Impact
    Availability and Cost of Credit and Have Other Adverse Effects
    on Us and the Market Price of Our Stock.

Our
    ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt
    obligations will depend on our operating and financial
    performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic
    conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond
    our control. During the past few years, the United States stock
    and credit markets have experienced significant price
    volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have
    caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially
    and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen
    considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted
    liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain
    financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in
    the unavailability of financing. Continued uncertainty in the
    stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to
    access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our
    properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may
    negatively affect our business. Additionally, due to this
    uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing
    indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not



be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. If we
    are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due,
    we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous
    terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other
    debt and to meet our other obligations. A prolonged downturn in
    the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources
    of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to
    adjust our business plan accordingly. These events also may make
    it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the
    issuance of our common or preferred stock. The disruptions in
    the financial markets have had and may continue to have a
    material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares
    and other adverse effects on us and our business.

Prospective buyers of our properties may also experience
    difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more
    difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing
    levels. Tightening of credit in financial markets and high
    unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of
    tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue
    increasing rents on a prospective basis. Disruptions in the
    credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects
    on us and the overall economy.

A Change in U.S. Government Policy Regarding Fannie Mae
    or Freddie Mac Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our
    Business.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are a major
    source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate.
    We and other multifamily companies depend heavily on Fannie Mae
    and Freddie Mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing
    apartment loans. In September 2008, the U.S. government
    assumed control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and placed both
    companies into a government conservatorship under the Federal
    Housing Finance Agency. The Administration has recently proposed
    potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the
    U.S. that could involve the phase out of Fannie Mae and
    Freddie Mac. While we believe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will
    continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they
    discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or
    be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would
    significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely
    affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness
    at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to
    sale assets. Uncertainty in the future activity and involvement
    of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a source of financing could
    negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it
    more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may
    adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do
    sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of
    debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.

The Soundness of Financial Institutions Could Adversely
    Affect Us.

We have relationships with many
    financial institutions, including lenders under our credit
    facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with
    counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result,
    defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial
    institutions or the financial services industry generally, could
    result in losses or defaults by these institutions. In the event
    that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects
    these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other
    parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete
    transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our
    business and results of operations.

Changing Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and
    Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow and the Market Price of Our
    Securities.

We currently have, and expect to
    incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary
    with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2010, UDR,
    Inc. had approximately $1 billion of variable rate
    indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 29% of
    total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership had
    approximately $304 million of variable rate indebtedness
    outstanding, which constitutes approximately 28% of total
    outstanding indebtedness as of such date. An increase in
    interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase
    the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing
    new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely
    affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make
    distributions to security holders. The effect of prolonged
    interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to
    make acquisitions and develop properties. In addition, an
    increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders
    to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect
    the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt
    securities.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May
    Result in Material Charges.

From time to time
    when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit
    our exposure to fluctuations in interest



rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities
    by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. We may do this
    to increase the predictability of our financing costs. Also,
    from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts
    to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable
    changes in market interest rates. If the terms of new debt
    securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest
    rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest
    rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore,
    the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved
    and may in the future involve material charges. In addition, our
    use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to
    additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a
    hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations.
    Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex
    and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated
    with interest rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that
    our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on
    our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of
    these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as
    transaction fees or breakage costs.

Risks
    Related to Tax Laws

We Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if UDR Failed to
    Qualify as a REIT.

UDR has elected to be taxed as
    a REIT under the Code. Our qualification as a REIT requires us
    to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and
    quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex
    Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or
    administrative interpretations, and involves the determination
    of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within
    our control. We intend that our current organization and method
    of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT, but we
    may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified
    in the future. In addition, U.S. federal income tax laws
    governing REITs and other corporations and the administrative
    interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time,
    potentially with retroactive effect. Future legislation, new
    regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions
    could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or
    adversely affect our stockholders.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be
    subject to federal income tax (including any applicable
    alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular
    corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends
    paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. Also,
    unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under
    certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect REIT status
    until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first
    failed to qualify as a REIT. The additional tax liability from
    the failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce or eliminate the
    amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our
    stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse
    effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise
    additional capital. In addition, we would no longer be required
    to make distributions to our stockholders. Even if we continue
    to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain
    federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

REITs May Pay a Portion of Dividends in Common
    Stock.

In December 2009, the Internal Revenue
    Service issued Revenue Procedure

2010-12,

which expanded previously issued temporary guidance relating to
    certain stock distributions made by publicly traded REITs to
    satisfy their tax-related distribution requirements. This
    expanded temporary guidance is intended to permit REITs to limit
    cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the
    current downturn in economic conditions. Under this expanded
    guidance, for stock dividends declared on or after
    January 1, 2008 and before December 31, 2012, with
    respect to a taxable year ending on or before December 31,
    2011, the Internal Revenue Service will treat a distribution of
    stock by a publicly traded REIT, pursuant to certain stockholder
    elections to receive either stock or cash, as a taxable
    distribution of property, provided that, among other conditions,
    (i) the total amount of cash available for distribution is
    not less than 10% of the aggregate declared distribution, and
    (ii) if too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each
    stockholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata
    amount of cash corresponding to its respective entitlement under
    the declaration, but in no event will any such electing
    stockholder receive less than 10% of the stockholder’s
    entire entitlement in money. The amount of such stock
    distribution will generally be treated as equal to the amount of
    cash that could have been received instead. If we pay a portion
    of our dividends in shares of our common stock pursuant to this
    temporary guidance, our stockholders may receive less cash than
    they received in distributions in prior years and the market
    value of our securities may decline.



UDR May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable
    REIT Subsidiaries, Which are Subject to Certain Tax
    Risks.

We have established several taxable REIT
    subsidiaries. Despite UDR’s qualification as a REIT, its
    taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable
    income. In addition, we must comply with various tests to
    continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    and our income from and investments in our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and
    investments for these tests. While we will attempt to ensure
    that our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not
    adversely affect our REIT qualification, we cannot provide
    assurance that we will successfully achieve that result.
    Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may
    jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property
    sales, or our taxable REIT subsidiaries may be denied
    deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or
    are otherwise not respected.

REIT Distribution Requirements Limit Our Available
    Cash.

As a REIT, UDR is subject to annual
    distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we
    retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund
    our growth. We generally must distribute annually at least 90%
    of our net REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain,
    in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to
    corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to our
    stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code.
    However, differences in timing between the recognition of
    taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us
    to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term
    basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code.

Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited
    Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain
    Attributable to the Transaction.

From time to
    time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our
    properties. Under the Code, any gain resulting from transfers of
    properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to
    customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as
    income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100%
    penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment
    purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or
    disposals of property are prohibited transactions. However,
    whether property is held for investment purposes is a question
    of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances
    surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue
    Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of
    properties by us are prohibited transactions. If the Internal
    Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer or
    disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction,
    then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain
    allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may
    jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property
    sales. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might
    adversely affect UDR’s ability to satisfy the income tests
    for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

We Could Face Possible State and Local Tax Audits and Adverse
    Changes in State and Local Tax Laws.

As discussed
    in the risk factors above, because UDR is organized and
    qualifies as a REIT it is generally not subject to federal
    income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local
    taxes. From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or
    regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our
    tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and
    municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to
    an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such
    changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and
    local taxes. These increased tax costs could adversely affect
    our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the
    payment of distributions to our stockholders. In the normal
    course of business, entities through which we own real estate
    may also become subject to tax audits. If such entities become
    subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of
    such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial
    condition.

The Operating Partnership Intends to Qualify as a
    Partnership, But Cannot Guarantee That It Will
    Qualify.

The Operating Partnership intends to
    qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any
    such time that the Operating Partnership admits additional
    limited partners other than UDR, Inc. If classified as a
    partnership, the Operating Partnership generally will not be a
    taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability.
    However, the Operating Partnership would be treated as a
    corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a
    “publicly traded partnership,” unless at least 90% of
    the Operating Partnership’s income was qualifying income as
    defined in the Code. A “publicly traded partnership”
    is a partnership whose



partnership interests are traded on an established securities
    market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the
    substantial equivalent thereof). Although the Operating
    Partnership’s partnership units are not traded on an
    established securities market, because of the redemption right,
    the Operating Partnership’s units held by limited partners
    could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or
    the substantial equivalent thereof), and the Operating
    Partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe
    harbors” under the applicable tax regulations. Qualifying
    income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such
    as real property rents, dividends and interest. The income
    requirements applicable to REITs and the definition of
    qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in
    most respects. The Operating Partnership may not meet this
    qualifying income test. If the Operating Partnership were to be
    taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax
    liabilities, and UDR, Inc. would then fail to qualify as a REIT
    for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain
    statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise
    additional capital would be impaired.

Risks
    Related to Our Organization and Ownership of UDR, Inc.’s
    Stock

Changes in Market Conditions and Volatility of Stock Prices
    Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common
    Stock.

The stock markets, including the New York
    Stock Exchange, on which we list UDR, Inc’s common stock,
    have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a
    result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly
    volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a
    decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases
    unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition
    to the risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section, a
    number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of
    our common stock, including:

•

general market and economic conditions;

•

actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating
    results or dividends or our payment of dividends in shares of
    our stock;

•

changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•

difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or
    refinance existing debt;

•

decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations;

•

changes in market valuations of similar companies;

•

publication of research reports about us or the real estate
    industry;

•

the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the
    attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other
    equity securities (including securities issued by other real
    estate companies);

•

general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in
    interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead
    prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual
    yield from future dividends;

•

a change in analyst ratings;

•

additions or departures of key management personnel;

•

adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the
    future;

•

speculation in the press or investment community;

•

terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in
    which our securities trade, possibly increasing market
    volatility and causing the further erosion of business and
    consumer confidence and spending;

•

failure to qualify as a REIT;

•

strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as
    acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic
    investments or changes in business strategy;



•

failure to satisfy listing requirements of the NYSE;

•

governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and

•

the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or the
    perception that such sales might occur, including under our

at-the-market

equity distribution program.

Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These
    factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock
    to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of
    operations, business or our prospects.

We May Change the Dividend Policy for Our Common Stock in the
    Future.

The decision to declare and pay dividends
    on UDR’s common stock, as well as the timing, amount and
    composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole
    discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our
    earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition,
    capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other
    limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution
    requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, state law
    and such other factors as our board of directors considers
    relevant. Any change in our dividend policy could have a
    material adverse effect on the market price of UDR’s common
    stock.

Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to
    Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in Our
    Stockholders’ Best Interests.

Maryland
    business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to
    acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject
    to various Maryland laws which may have the effect of
    discouraging offers to acquire our Company and of increasing the
    difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our
    acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests.
    The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other
    business combination transactions between us and any person who
    acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock
    representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board
    of directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination
    transaction could not be completed until five years after the
    person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the
    approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled
    to be cast and


/


%
    of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested
    stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also
    provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our
    equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of
    the voting power in electing directors will have no voting
    rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares
    eligible to vote.

Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability
    of Our Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company
    Restricts the Transferability of Our Stock and May Prevent
    Takeovers That are Beneficial to Our
    Stockholders.

One of the requirements for
    maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal
    income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our
    outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer
    individuals, including entities specified in the Code, during
    the last half of any taxable year. Our charter contains
    ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock
    primarily to assist us in complying with this and other REIT
    ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the
    effect of preventing a change of control, which does not
    threaten REIT status. These restrictions include a provision
    that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9%
    of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board
    of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation,
    provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to
    exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. Absent
    such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of
    our stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership
    limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of
    the ownership requirements of the Code for REITs, will be
    considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such
    stock will acquire no rights in such shares. These provisions of
    our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
    preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a
    change of control might involve a premium price for our
    stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’
    best interests.

On February 17, 2011, the closing sale price of our common
    stock was $23.82 per share on the NYSE and there were 4,804
    holders of record of the 182,496,330 outstanding shares of our
    common stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax purposes,
    approximately 95% of the distributions for 2010 represented
    ordinary income, 3% represented long-term capital gain, and 2%
    represented unrecaptured section 1250 gain.

UDR pays regular quarterly distributions to holders of its
    common stock. Future distributions will be at the discretion of
    our Board of Directors and will depend on our actual funds from
    operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the
    annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of
    the Code, and other factors. The annual distribution payment for
    calendar year 2010 necessary for us to maintain our status as a
    REIT was $0.002 per share of common stock. We declared total
    distributions of $0.73 per share of common stock for 2010.

Series E
    Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
    (“Series E”) has no stated par value and a
    liquidation preference of $16.61 per share. Subject to certain
    adjustments and conditions, each share of the Series E is
    convertible at any time and from time to time at the
    holder’s option into one share of our common stock prior to
    the Special Dividend. The holders of the Series E are
    entitled to vote on an as-converted basis as a single class in
    combination with the holders of common stock at any meeting of
    our stockholders for the election of directors or for any other
    purpose on which the holders of common stock are entitled to
    vote. The Series E has no stated maturity and is not
    subject to any sinking fund or any mandatory redemption. In
    connection with the Special Dividend, the Company reserved for
    issuance upon conversion of the Series E additional shares
    of common stock to which a holder of the Series E would
    have received if the holder had converted the Series E
    immediately prior to the record date for the Special Dividend.

Distributions declared on the Series E in 2010 were $1.33
    per share or $0.3322 per quarter. The Series E is not
    listed on any exchange. At December 31, 2010, a total of
    2,803,812 shares of the Series E were outstanding.

Series F
    Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of our
    Series F (“Series F”) Preferred Stock. The
    Series F Preferred Stock may be purchased by holders of our
    Operating Partnership Units, or OP Units, described below
    under “Operating Partnership Units,” at a purchase
    price of $0.0001 per share. OP Unitholders are entitled to
    subscribe for and purchase one share of the Series F for
    each OP Unit held. At December 31,



2010, a total of 3,208,706 shares of the Series F were
    outstanding at a value of $321. Holders of the Series F are
    entitled to one vote for each share of the Series F they
    hold, voting together with the holders of our common stock, on
    each matter submitted to a vote of security holders at a meeting
    of our stockholders. The Series F does not entitle its
    holders to any other rights, privileges or preferences.

Series G
    Preferred Stock

In May 2007, UDR issued 5,400,000 shares of our 6.75%
    Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock
    (“Series G”). The Series G has no stated par
    value and a liquidation preference of $25 per share. The
    Series G generally has no voting rights except under
    certain limited circumstances and as required by law. The
    Series G has no stated maturity and is not subject to any
    sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not convertible into
    any of our other securities. The Series G is not redeemable
    prior to May 31, 2012. On or after this date, the
    Series G may be redeemed for cash at our option, in whole
    or in part, at a redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued
    and unpaid dividends. During the year ended December 31,
    2010, the Company repurchased 27,400 shares of
    Series G, for less than the liquidation preference of $25
    per share resulting in a $25,000 benefit to our net loss
    attributable to common stockholders. Distributions declared on
    the Series G for the year ended December 31, 2010 was
    $1.69 per share. The Series G is listed on the NYSE under
    the symbol “UDRPrG.” At December 31, 2010, a
    total of 3,405,562 shares of the Series G were
    outstanding.

Distribution
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
    under which holders of our common stock may elect to
    automatically reinvest their distributions and make additional
    cash payments to acquire additional shares of our common stock.
    Stockholders who do not participate in the plan continue to
    receive distributions as declared. As of February 17, 2011,
    there were approximately 2,707 participants in the plan.

United
    Dominion Realty, L.P.

Operating
    Partnership Units

There is no established public trading market for United
    Dominion Realty, L.P.’s Operating Partnership Units. From
    time to time we issue shares of our common stock in exchange for
    OP Units tendered to the Operating Partnership, for
    redemption in accordance with the provisions of the Operating
    Partnership’s limited partnership agreement. At
    December 31, 2010, there were 179,909,408 OP Units
    outstanding in the Operating Partnership, of which 174,847,440
    OP Units or 97.2% were owned by UDR and 5,061,968
    OP Units or 2.8% were owned by limited partners. Under the
    terms of the Operating Partnership’s limited partnership
    agreement, the holders of OP Units have the right to
    require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of
    the OP Units held by the holder in exchange for a cash
    payment based on the market value of our common stock at the
    time of redemption. However, the Operating Partnership’s
    obligation to pay the cash amount is subject to the prior right
    of the Company to acquire such OP Units in exchange for
    either the cash amount or the number of shares of our common
    stock equal to the number of OP Units being redeemed.
    During 2010, we issued a total of 924,624 shares of common
    stock upon redemption of OP Units.

Purchases
    of Equity Securities

In February 2006, UDR’s Board of Directors authorized a
    10,000,000 share repurchase program. In January 2008,
    UDR’s Board of Directors authorized a new
    15,000,000 share repurchase program. Under the two share
    repurchase programs, UDR may repurchase shares of our common
    stock in open market purchases, block purchases, privately
    negotiated transactions or otherwise. As reflected in the table
    below, no shares of common stock were repurchased under these
    programs during the quarter ended December 31, 2010.

Comparison
    of One-, Three- and Five- year Cumulative Total
    Returns

The following graphs compare the one-, three- and five-year
    cumulative total returns for UDR common stock with the
    comparable cumulative return of the NAREIT Equity REIT Index,
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index, the NAREIT
    Equity Apartment Index and the MSCI US REIT Index. Each graph
    assumes that $100 was invested on December 31 (of the initial
    year shown in the graph), in each of our common stock and the
    indices presented. Historical stock price performance is not
    necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. The
    comparisons assume that all dividends are reinvested.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Forward-Looking
    Statements

This Report contains forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such
    forward-looking statements include, without limitation,
    statements concerning property acquisitions and dispositions,
    development activity and capital expenditures, capital raising
    activities, rent growth, occupancy, and rental expense growth.
    Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”
    “seeks,” “estimates,” and variations of such
    words and similar expressions are intended to identify such
    forward-looking statements. Such statements involve known and
    unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause
    our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
    different from the results of operations or plans expressed or
    implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors
    include, among other things, unanticipated adverse business
    developments affecting us, or our properties, adverse changes in
    the real estate markets and general and local economies and
    business conditions.



The following factors, among others, could cause our future
    results to differ materially from those expressed in the
    forward-looking statements:

•

general economic conditions;

•

unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions
    that could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates;

•

the failure of acquisitions to achieve anticipated results;

•

possible difficulty in selling apartment communities;

•

competitive factors that may limit our ability to lease
    apartment homes or increase or maintain rents;

•

insufficient cash flow that could affect our debt financing and
    create refinancing risk;

•

failure to generate sufficient revenue, which could impair our
    debt service payments and distributions to stockholders;

•

development and construction risks that may impact our
    profitability;

•

potential damage from natural disasters, including hurricanes
    and other weather-related events, which could result in
    substantial costs to us;

•

risks from extraordinary losses for which we may not have
    insurance or adequate reserves;

•

uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insurance
    retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess
    of applicable coverage;

•

delays in completing developments and

lease-ups

on
    schedule;

•

our failure to succeed in new markets;

•

changing interest rates, which could increase interest costs and
    affect the market price of our securities;

•

potential liability for environmental contamination, which could
    result in substantial costs to us;

•

the imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a REIT
    under the Code in any taxable year;

•

our internal control over financial reporting may not be
    considered effective which could result in a loss of investor
    confidence in our financial reports, and in turn have an adverse
    effect on our stock price; and

•

changes in real estate laws, tax laws and other laws affecting
    our business.

A discussion of these and other factors affecting our business
    and prospects is set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk
    Factors. We encourage investors to review these risk factors.

Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the
    forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any
    of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore such
    statements included in this Report may not prove to be accurate.
    In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the
    forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of
    such information should not be regarded as a representation by
    us or any other person that the results or conditions described
    in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved.

Forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and
    other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we
    expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or
    revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to
    reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or
    any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which
    any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise
    required by law.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
    consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein and
    is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements and
    the



accompanying notes for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 of each of UDR, Inc. and United Domination Realty,
    L.P.

UDR,
    Inc.:

Business
    Overview

We are a self administered real estate investment trust, or
    REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and
    manages apartment communities in select markets throughout the
    United States. We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation.
    In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from
    Virginia to Maryland. Our subsidiaries include two operating
    partnerships, Heritage Communities L.P., a Delaware limited
    partnership, and United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware
    limited partnership.

At December 31, 2010, our consolidated real estate
    portfolio included 172 communities located in 23 markets with a
    total of 48,553 completed apartment homes and our total real
    estate portfolio, inclusive of our unconsolidated communities,
    included an additional 37 communities with 9,891 completed
    apartment homes.

Total Income per Occupied Home
    represents total revenues divided by the product of occupancy
    and the number of mature apartment homes.

(b)

The Company is currently developing
    four wholly-owned communities with 930 apartment homes, none of
    which have been completed.

We report in two segments: Same Communities and Non-Mature/Other
    Communities. Our Same Communities segment includes those
    communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to
    January 1, 2009, and held as of December 31, 2010.
    These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and



operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there
    is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and
    the community is not held for disposition within the current
    year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy
    once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive
    months. Our Non-Mature/Other Communities segment includes those
    communities that were acquired or developed in 2008, 2009 or
    2010, sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition, condominium
    conversion properties, joint venture properties, properties
    managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of
    mixed use properties.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial
    obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale of
    properties, and the issuance of debt and equity. Both the
    coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective
    capital management are important to the maintenance of
    liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from
    operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and
    operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes
    and borrowings under credit agreements. We routinely use our
    unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing
    and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term
    financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. During
    the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate
    have been used for both investing and financing activities as we
    repositioned our portfolio.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements
    generally through cash flow provided by operations and
    borrowings under credit agreements. We expect to meet certain
    long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt
    maturities, the repayment of financing on development
    activities, and potential property acquisitions, through secured
    and unsecured borrowings, the issuance of debt or equity
    securities, and the disposition of properties. We believe that
    our net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit
    agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating
    requirements and the payment of dividends by the Company in
    accordance with REIT requirements. Likewise, the budgeted
    expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain
    properties are expected to be funded from property operations,
    borrowings under credit agreements, and the issuance of debt or
    equity securities.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission, or “SEC” which provides for
    the issuance of an indeterminate amount of Common Stock,
    Preferred Stock, guarantees of debt securities, warrants,
    subscription rights, purchase contracts and units to facilitate
    future financing activities in the public capital markets.
    Access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at
    the time of issuance.

On September 13, 2010, the Company entered into an
    agreement to sell 16,000,000 shares of its Common Stock at
    a price of $20.35 per share in an underwritten public offering.
    The Company granted the underwriters a

30-day

option to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of
    Common Stock to cover overallotments. We sold
    18,400,000 shares of Common Stock in this offering, with
    aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $374.4 million at
    a price per share of $20.35. Aggregate net proceeds from the
    offering, after deducting related expenses were approximately
    $359.2 million.

On September 15, 2009, the Company entered into an equity
    distribution agreement under which the Company may offer and
    sell up to 15,000,000 shares of its Common Stock over time
    to or through its sales agents. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, we sold 6,144,367 shares of Common
    Stock through this program for aggregate gross proceeds of
    approximately $110.8 million at a weighted average price
    per share of $18.04. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales,
    after deducting related expenses, including commissions paid to
    the sales agents of approximately $2.2 million, were
    approximately $108.6 million.

On December 7, 2009, the Company entered into an Amended
    and Restated Distribution Agreement with respect to the issue
    and sale by the Company from time to time of its Medium-Term
    Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue.
    In February 2010, the Company issued $150 million of
    5.25% senior unsecured medium-term notes under the Amended
    and Restated Distribution Agreement. These notes were priced at
    99.46% of the principal amount at issuance and had a discount of
    $519,000 at December 31, 2010.



Future
    Capital Needs

Future development expenditures are expected to be funded with
    proceeds from construction loans, through joint ventures,
    unsecured or secured credit facilities, proceeds from the
    issuance of equity or debt securities, the sale of properties
    and to a lesser extent, with cash flows provided by operating
    activities. Acquisition activity in strategic markets is
    expected to be financed by the reinvestment of proceeds from the
    sale of properties, through the issuance of equity or debt
    securities, the issuance of operating partnership units and the
    assumption or placement of secured

and/or

unsecured debt.

During 2011, we have approximately $63.4 million of secured
    debt maturing, inclusive of principal amortization and net of
    extension rights of $188.1 million, and $95.8 million
    of unsecured debt maturing. We anticipate repaying that debt
    with proceeds from debt and equity offerings and by exercising
    extension rights with respect to the secured debt.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to use judgment in the application of
    accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.
    A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to
    our financial condition and results of operations as well as
    involves some degree of uncertainty. Estimates are prepared
    based on management’s assessment after considering all
    evidence available. Changes in estimates could affect our
    financial position or results of operations. Below is a
    discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical
    to understanding our financial condition or results of
    operations where there is uncertainty or where significant
    judgment is required.

Capital
    Expenditures

In conformity with GAAP, we capitalize those expenditures that
    materially enhance the value of an existing asset or
    substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset.
    Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in
    ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.

During 2010, $47.1 million or $1,047 per apartment home was
    spent on recurring capital expenditures. These include revenue
    enhancing capital expenditures, exterior/interior upgrades,
    turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and
    appliances, other recurring capital expenditures such as
    exterior paint, roofs, siding, parking lots, and asset
    preservation capital expenditures. In addition, major
    renovations totaled $30.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. Total capital expenditures, which in
    aggregate include recurring capital expenditures and major
    renovations, of $77.9 million or $1,732 per home was spent
    on all of our communities, excluding development and commercial
    properties, for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and
    maintenance costs for all of our communities, excluding real
    estate under development, condominium conversions and commercial
    properties, for the periods presented:

We will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing

    investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital.
    Recurring capital expenditures during 2011 are currently
    expected to be approximately $1,050 per apartment home.

Investment
    in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

We continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint
    ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    there may be an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a
    decrease in the value of the investment is

other-than-temporary.

These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the
    venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the
    entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the
    entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture
    partners and its lenders. The amount of loss recognized is the
    excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its
    estimated fair value. If we believe that the decline in fair
    value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. The
    aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in
    determining the valuation of our investment property. Should the
    actual results differ from management’s judgment, the
    valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a
    negative impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
    operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
    assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
    estimated to be generated by the future operation and
    disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of
    those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical
    results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market
    and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The
    net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market
    value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best
    estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market
    rates and transactions.

Real
    Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time
    and allocate the purchase price to various components, such as
    land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases. The
    purchase price is allocated based on the fair value of each
    component. The fair value of buildings is determined as if the
    buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased
    at market rental rates. As such, the determination of fair value
    considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be
    generated from the property including an initial

lease-up

period. We determine the fair value of in-place leases by
    assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease
    relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In
    addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the
    foregone rents associated with the

lease-up

period, and the carrying costs associated with the

lease-up

period. The fair value of in-place leases is recorded and
    amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual
    lease period.

REIT
    Status

We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for
    federal income tax purposes as a REIT. A REIT is a legal entity
    that holds interests in real estate and is required by the Code
    to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements,
    including a requirement that a REIT must distribute at least 90%
    of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to
    our stockholders. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any
    taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income
    taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to
    qualify as a REIT for four years. Based on the net earnings
    reported for the year ended December 31, 2010 in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations we would have incurred
    immaterial federal and state GAAP income taxes if we had failed
    to qualify as a REIT.



Statements
    of Cash Flow

The following discussion explains the changes in net cash
    provided by operating activities and net cash provided by/(used
    in) investing and net cash (used in)/provided by financing
    activities that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of
    Cash Flows.

Operating
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2010, our net cash flow
    provided by operating activities was $214.2 million
    compared to $229.4 million for 2009. The decrease in cash
    flow from operating activities is primarily due to changes in
    operating assets, which include an increase in lease tangibles
    related to the acquisition of five operating communities in
    2010, and operating liabilities, which include accrued
    restructuring and severance charges. This decrease is partially
    offset by an increase in property net operating income.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash flow
    provided by operating activities was $229.4 million
    compared to $179.8 million for 2008. The increase in cash
    flow from operating activities is primarily due to changes in
    operating liabilities and is partially offset by a reduction in
    property operating income.

Investing
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash used in
    investing activities was $583.8 million compared to net
    cash used in investing activities of $158 million for 2009.
    The change relates to acquisitions of real estate assets and
    investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, which are
    discussed in further detail throughout this Report.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash used in
    investing activities was $158 million compared to net cash
    provided by investing activities of $302.3 million for
    2008. The change is primarily driven by a reduction in the
    disposition of real estate investments partially offset by a
    reduction in the acquisition of real estate assets and capital
    expenditures, all of which are discussed in further detail
    throughout this Report.

Acquisitions

For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company acquired
    five apartment communities located in Orange County, California;
    Baltimore, Maryland; Los Angeles, California; and Boston,
    Massachusetts for a total gross purchase price of
    $412 million. During the same period, the Company also
    acquired land located in San Francisco, California for a
    gross purchase price of $23.6 million.

The purchase price is the

    include any costs that the Company incurred in the pursuit of
    the property.

Our long-term strategic plan is to continue achieving greater
    operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated
    markets. As a result, we have been seeking to expand our
    interests in communities located in California, Boston,
    Metropolitan D.C., Oregon and Washington state markets over the
    past years. Prospectively, we plan to channel new investments
    into those markets we believe will provide the best



investment returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined
    criteria including favorable job formation, low single-family
    home affordability and favorable demand/supply ratio for
    multifamily housing.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we acquired one
    community in Dallas, Texas with 289 apartment homes for
    $28.5 million.

Real
    Estate Under Development

At December 31, 2010, our development pipeline for
    wholly-owned communities totaled 930 apartment homes with a
    budget of $338.9 million in which we have a carrying value
    of $97.9 million. We anticipate the completion of these
    communities from the first quarter of 2012 through the third
    quarter of 2013.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, we invested
    approximately $92.1 million in development projects, a
    decrease of $91.0 million from our 2009 level of
    $183.2 million. In 2010, we completed development on four
    wholly-owned communities with 1,575 apartment homes that have a
    carrying value of $259.7 million and one community held by
    a consolidated joint venture with 274 apartment homes and a
    carrying value of $122.3 million.

Consolidated
    Joint Ventures

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Elements Too”) which owns and operates a 274
    home apartment community in the central business district of
    Bellevue, Washington. Construction began in the fourth quarter
    of 2006 and was completed in the first quarter of 2010. At
    closing, we owned 49% of the joint venture. Our initial
    investment was $10.0 million. On October 16, 2009, our
    partner resigned as managing member and appointed UDR as
    managing member. In addition, our partner relinquished its
    voting rights and approval rights and its ability to
    substantively participate in the decision-making process of the
    joint venture resulting in the consolidation of the joint
    venture. As a result of UDR’s appointment as managing
    member, the Company was required to consolidate the joint
    venture. In March 2010, the Company paid $3.2 million to
    acquire our partner’s 49% interest in the joint venture. At
    the closing of the agreement and at December 31, 2010, the
    Company held a 98% interest in Elements Too.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“989 Elements”) which owns and operates a
    23-story, 166 home high-rise apartment community in the central
    business district of Bellevue, Washington. At closing, UDR owned
    49% of the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $11.8 million. On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into
    an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49% interest in
    989 Elements for $7.7 million. Concurrently, our partner
    resigned as managing member and appointed UDR as managing
    member. In addition, our partner relinquished its voting rights
    and approval rights and its ability to substantively participate
    in the decision-making process of the joint venture resulting in
    the consolidation of the joint venture. In March 2010, the
    Company paid $7.7 million and acquired our partner’s
    49% interest in the joint venture. At the closing of the
    agreement and December 31, 2010, the Company held a 98%
    interest in 989 Elements.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Bellevue”) which owns an operating retail
    site in Bellevue, Washington. The Company initially planned to
    develop a 430 home high rise apartment building with ground
    floor retail on an existing operating retail center. However,
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, the joint venture
    decided to continue to operate the retail property as opposed to
    developing a high rise apartment building on the site. On
    December 30, 2009, UDR entered into an agreement with our
    partner to purchase its 49% interest in Bellevue for
    $5.2 million. In addition, our partner resigned as managing
    member and appointed UDR as managing member. Concurrent with its
    resignation, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture resulting in
    the consolidation of the joint venture at fair value. In March
    2010, the Company paid $5.2 million and acquired our
    partner’s 49% interest in the joint venture. At the closing
    of the agreement and at December 31, 2010, the Company held
    a 98% interest in Bellevue.

Prior to their consolidation in 2009, we evaluated our
    investments in these joint ventures when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that there may be an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. We considered



various factors to determine if a decrease in value of each of
    these investments is

other-than-temporary.

In 2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of $16 million
    representing the

other-than-temporary

decline in fair values below the carrying values of two of the
    Company’s Bellevue, Washington joint ventures.

For additional information regarding these joint ventures, see
    Note 5,

Joint Ventures

, in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in this Report.

Unconsolidated
    Joint Ventures

In November 2010, the Company acquired The Hanover
    Company’s (“Hanover”) partnership interests in
    the Hanover/MetLife Master Limited Partnership (the
    “UDR/MetLife Partnership”). The UDR/MetLife
    Partnership owns a portfolio of 26 operating communities
    containing 5,748 homes and 11 land parcels with the
    potential to develop approximately 2,300 additional homes. Under
    the terms of the UDR/MetLife Partnership, UDR will act as the
    general partner and earn fees for property and asset management
    and financing transactions. UDR acquired ownership interests of
    12.27% in the operating communities and 4.14% in the land
    parcels for $100.8 million. The initial investment of
    $100.8 million consists of $71.8 million in cash,
    which includes associated transaction costs, and a
    $30 million payable (includes discount of $1 million)
    to Hanover. UDR agreed to pay the $30 million balance to
    Hanover in two interest free installments in the amounts of
    $20 million and $10 million on the first and second
    anniversaries of the closing, respectively. At December 31,
    2010, the Company’s investment in the Partnership was
    $122.2 million.

In October 2010, the Company entered into a venture with an
    affiliate of Hanover to develop a 240 apartment home community
    in the metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts area. At the closing
    and at December 31, 2010, UDR owned a noncontrolling
    interest of 95% in the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $10 million and our investment at December 31, 2010
    was $10.3 million.

During 2009, UDR and an unaffiliated third party formed a joint
    venture for the investment of up to $450 million in
    multifamily properties located in key, high barrier to entry
    markets. The partners will contribute equity of
    $180 million of which the Company’s maximum equity
    will be 30% or $54.0 million when fully invested. During
    2010, the joint venture acquired its first property (151 homes)
    located in Metropolitan Washington D.C. for $43.1 million.
    At closing and at December 31, 2010, the Company owned 30%.
    Our investment at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was
    $5.2 million and $242,000, respectively.

In November 2007, UDR and an unaffiliated third party formed a
    joint venture which owns and operates various properties located
    in Texas. UDR contributed cash and property equal to 20% of the
    fair value of the properties. The unaffiliated member
    contributed cash equal to 80% of the fair value of the
    properties comprising the joint venture, which was then used to
    purchase the nine operating properties from UDR. Our initial
    investment was $20.4 million. Our investment at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $10.3 million and
    $13.9 million, respectively.

Disposition
    of Investments

In 2010, UDR sold one 149 apartment home community. UDR
    recognized an after-tax gain for financial reporting purposes of
    $4 million on this sale that is included in discontinued
    operations. Proceeds from the sale were used primarily to reduce
    debt.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we did not dispose
    of any communities.

We plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets
    where long-term growth prospects are limited and redeploying
    capital into markets we believe will provide the best investment
    returns.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, UDR sold 86
    communities with a total of 25,684 apartment homes, for gross
    consideration of $1.7 billion, 53 condominiums from two
    communities with a total of 640 condominiums for gross
    consideration of $6.9 million, one parcel of land for gross
    proceeds of $1.6 million and one commercial property for
    gross proceeds of $6.5 million. We received
    $1.5 billion in cash and a note in the principal amount of
    $200 million. We recognized after-tax gains for financial
    reporting purposes of $786.4 million on these sales.
    Proceeds from the sales were used primarily to acquire new
    communities and



reduce debt. During 2008, we decided to discontinue sales of
    units with the two communities identified for condominium
    conversion until such time that the market conditions turn
    favorable and it is economically beneficial to sell those units
    versus operate the residual 525 apartment homes of those
    communities. As a result of our decision to revert the remaining
    units to operations the Company recorded a charge to earnings of
    $1.7 million, excluding the catch up for depreciation on
    the units when they were returned to operations.

As a result of our disposition activities in 2008, the Company
    declared a Special Dividend payable to holders of our common
    stock for $0.96 per share included with our recurring
    distribution for the Company’s fourth quarter of 2008 for a
    total of $1.29 per share payable on January 29, 2009 to
    stockholders of record on December 9, 2008. Additional
    information regarding the Special Dividend is set forth in
    Item 1. Business in Part 1 of this Report.

In conjunction with the transaction in which we sold 86
    communities for $1.7 billion, we received a note in the
    amount of $200.0 million. The note was paid in full in 2009.

Financing
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2010, our net cash provided
    by/(used in) financing activities was $373.1 million
    compared to ($78.1 million) for the comparable period of
    2009.

The following significant financing activity occurred during the
    year ended December 31, 2010:

•

repaid $187.3 million of secured debt and
    $50.0 million of maturing medium-term unsecured notes. The
    $187.3 million of secured debt includes $70.5 million
    for a maturing construction loan held by one of our consolidated
    joint ventures, repayment of $52.7 million of credit
    facilities and $64.1 million of mortgage payments;

•

repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $29.2 million for $29.4 million resulting in a loss on
    extinguishment of $1 million, which includes the write off
    of related deferred finance charges. The unsecured debt
    repurchased by the Company matures in 2011. As a result of this
    repurchase, the loss is represented as an addition to interest
    expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations;

•

net repayments of $157.6 million were applied toward our
    $600 million revolving credit facility;

•

received proceeds of $70.2 million from secured debt
    financings. The $70.2 million includes $37.8 million
    in variable rate mortgages, $21.1 million in fixed rate
    mortgages, and $11.3 million in credit facilities;

•

closed on a $250 million, five-year unsecured term loan
    facility of which $100 million was swapped into a fixed
    rate of 3.76% and $150 million has rate of LIBOR plus
    200 basis points;

•

in February 2010, we issued $150 million of
    5.25% senior unsecured medium-term notes under our Amended
    and Restated Distribution Agreement with respect to the issue
    and sale by us from time to time of our Medium-Term Notes,
    Series A Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue. These
    notes were priced at 99.46% of the principal amount at issuance
    and had a discount of $519,000 at December 31, 2010;

•

we sold 6,144,367 shares of Common Stock for aggregate
    gross proceeds of approximately $110.8 million at a
    weighted average price per share of $18.04 through our “At
    the Market” equity distribution program, which we initiated
    in 2009, pursuant to which we may sell up to
    15,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time to or
    through sales agents, by means of ordinary brokers’
    transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market
    prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the
    applicable agent. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after
    deducting related expenses, including commissions paid to the
    sales agents of approximately $2.2 million, were
    approximately $108.6 million;

•

initiated an underwritten public offering to sell
    16,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.35
    per share. We granted the underwriters a

30-day

option to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of
    common stock to cover overallotments, if any. We sold
    18,400,000 shares of common stock in this offering for
    aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $374.4 million at
    a price



of $20.35 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from the offering,
    after deducting related expenses were approximately
    $359.2 million; and

•

repurchased 27,400 shares of our 6.75% Series G
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $637,000, less than
    their liquidation value of $685,000.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash used in
    financing activities was $78.1 million compared to
    $472.5 million for the comparable period of 2008. The
    decrease in financing activities was due to a net issuance of
    debt in 2009 versus net payments in 2008 and the repurchase of
    shares of our Common Stock in 2008. These cash outflows were
    offset by the issuance of common equity through a public
    offering.

Credit
    Facilities

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we have secured revolving
    credit facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment
    of $1.4 billion with $1.2 billion outstanding. The
    Fannie Mae credit facilities are for an initial term of
    10 years, bear interest at floating and fixed rates, and
    certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an
    additional five years at our option. We have $897.3 million
    of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate
    of 5.3% and the remaining balance on these facilities is
    currently at a weighted average variable rate of 1.7% as of
    December 31, 2010. We had $950.0 million of the funded
    balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% and
    the remaining balance on these facilities was at a weighted
    average variable rate of 1.7% as of December 31, 2009.

We have a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility
    that matures on July 26, 2012. Under certain circumstances,
    we may increase the $600 million credit facility to
    $750 million. Based on our current credit rating, the
    $600 million credit facility carries an interest rate equal
    to LIBOR plus 47.5 basis points. In addition, the unsecured
    credit facility contains a provision that allows us to bid up to
    50% of the commitment and we can bid out the entire unsecured
    credit facility once per quarter so long as we maintain an
    investment grade rating. As of December 31, 2010, we had
    $31.8 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit
    facility leaving $568.2 million of unused capacity
    (excluding $4.8 million of letters of credit at
    December 31, 2010). As of December 31, 2009, we had
    $189.3 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit
    facility.

The Fannie Mae credit facilities and the bank revolving credit
    facility are subject to customary financial covenants and
    limitations. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance
    with all financial covenants under these credit facilities.

Interest
    Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable
    rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced.
    We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other
    speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial
    instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets.
    Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in
    market interest rates and the fair value of market rate
    sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as
    changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable
    rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. We had $1 billion
    in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap
    contracts as of December 31, 2010. If market interest rates
    for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, our
    interest expense would increase by $9.3 million based on
    the average balance outstanding during the year.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of
    hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These
    analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of
    overall economic activity that could exist in such an
    environment. Further, in the event of a change of such
    magnitude, management would likely take actions to further
    mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the
    uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and
    their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no
    change in our financial structure.



Funds
    from Operations

Funds from operations, or FFO, is defined as net income
    (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses)
    from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate
    depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute FFO
    for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations
    set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment
    Trust’s (“NAREIT”) April 1, 2002 White
    Paper. We consider FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and
    our operating performance, and believe that FFO should be
    considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income
    and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. FFO does not represent
    cash generated from operating activities in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily
    indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance
    with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate
    assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate
    values instead have historically risen or fallen with market
    conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered
    the presentation of operating results for real estate companies
    that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by
    themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure
    of REIT operating performance and defines FFO as net income
    (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from
    sales of depreciable property, premiums or original issuance
    costs associated with preferred stock redemptions, plus
    depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The use of FFO,
    combined with the required presentations, has been fundamentally
    beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results of
    REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT
    operating results more meaningful. We generally consider FFO to
    be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and
    financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in
    conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of
    performance) because by excluding gains or losses related to
    sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and
    excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO
    can help one compare the operating performance of a
    Company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
    different companies. We believe that FFO is the best measure of
    economic profitability for real estate investment trusts.

    reconciliation to GAAP for the three years ended

    benefits and gain on sales, net of taxes, to be a meaningful

Results
    of Operations

The following discussion includes the results of both continuing
    and discontinued operations for the periods presented.

Net
    (Loss)/ Income Attributable to Common Stockholders

    -vs-2009

Net loss attributable to common stockholders was
    $112.4 million ($0.68 per diluted share) for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 as compared to net loss attributable to
    common stockholders of $95.9 million ($0.64 per diluted
    share) for the comparable period in the prior year. The increase
    in net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year
    ended December 31, 2010 resulted primarily from the
    following items, all of which are discussed in further detail
    elsewhere within this Report:

•

an increase in depreciation expense primarily due to the
    Company’s acquisition of five apartment communities in the
    third quarter of 2010, consolidation of certain joint venture
    assets in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the completion of
    redevelopment and development communities in 2009 and 2010;

•

an increase in interest expense primarily due to debt
    extinguishment gain from the repurchase of unsecured debt
    securities in 2009; and



•

an increase in severance costs and restructuring charges in the
    fourth quarter of 2010 due to the consolidation of corporate
    operations and the centralization of job functions from its
    Richmond, Virginia office to its Highlands Ranch, Colorado
    headquarters, in addition to severance costs related to the
    retirement of an executive officer of the Company.

The increase to our net loss attributable to common stockholders
    was partially offset by:

•

an increase in our net operating income
    (“NOI”); and

•

a decrease in our loss from unconsolidated entities primarily
    due to the recognition of a $16 million non-cash charge
    representing an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of equity investments in two of our
    unconsolidated joint ventures during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

    -vs-2008

Net loss attributable to common stockholders was
    ($95.9 million) ($0.64 per diluted share) for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 as compared to net income
    attributable to common stockholders of $688.7 million
    ($5.29 per diluted share) for the comparable period in the prior
    year. The decrease in net income available to common
    stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2009 resulted
    primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed
    in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

a reduction in disposition gains in 2009 as compared to 2008.
    The Company recognized net gains of $3.2 million and
    $807.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively;

•

an increase in our loss from unconsolidated entities, primarily
    due to the recognition of a $16 million non-cash charge
    representing an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of equity investments in two of our
    unconsolidated joint ventures during the year ended
    December 31, 2009;

•

the recognition of an income tax benefit from the Company’s
    Taxable REIT Subsidiaries, or “TRS” during 2008;

•

an increase in depreciation expense primarily due to the
    Company’s acquisition of operating properties and the
    completion of redevelopment and development communities in 2008
    and 2009;

•

a decrease in other income primarily due to a reduction in fees
    earned for both recurring and non-recurring items related to the
    Company’s joint ventures and a decrease in interest income;

•

change in net income/(loss) attributable to redeemable
    non-controlling interest of $50.2 million.

The decreases to our net income available to common stockholders
    were partially offset by a decrease in general and
    administrative expense of $7.4 million when compared to
    2008.

Apartment
    Community Operations

Our net income is primarily generated from the operation of our
    apartment communities. The following table summarizes the

Same
    Communities

2010-vs.-2009

Our same store communities (those acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to January 1, 2009 and held on
    December 31, 2010) consisted of 40,699 apartment homes
    and provided $358.0 million or 88% of our total property
    NOI for the year ended December 31, 2010.

NOI for our same community properties decreased 1.7% or
    $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease in property
    NOI was primarily attributable to a 0.9% or $5.0 million
    decrease in property rental income and a 0.6% or
    $1.1 million increase in operating expenses. The decrease
    in revenues was primarily driven by a 2.4% or $12.8 million
    decrease in rental rates which was offset by a 57.7% or
    $2.7 million decrease in concessions, an 8.3% or
    $1.8 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 12.4% or
    $2.8 million increase in reimbursement income. Physical
    occupancy increased 0.4% to 95.7% and total income per occupied
    home decreased $16 to $1,155.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 3.3% or $935,000 increase in utilities expense, a 3.8% or
    $1.1 million increase in repairs and maintenance, and a
    2.6% or $1.2 million increase in personnel costs, which was
    partially offset by a 3.2% or $1.8 million decrease in real
    estate taxes.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
    net operating income divided by property rental income)
    decreased to 66.3% as compared to 66.8% in the comparable period
    in the prior year.

2009-vs.-2008

Our same store communities (those acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to January 1, 2008 and held on
    December 31, 2009) consisted of 33,166 apartment homes
    and provided $296.4 million or 76% of our total NOI for the
    year ended December 31, 2009.

NOI for our same community properties decreased 2.2% or
    $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in property
    NOI was primarily attributable to a 2.0% or $8.8 million
    decrease in property rental income, which was partially offset
    by a 1.6% or $2.3 million



decrease in operating expenses. The decrease in revenues was
    primarily driven by a 2.9% or $12.9 million decrease in
    rental rates which was offset by an 18.9% or $4.0 million
    decrease in vacancy loss and an 8.6% or $1.4 million
    increase in reimbursement income. Physical occupancy increased
    0.6% to 95.4% and total income per occupied home decreased $30
    to $1,149.

The decrease in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 1.3% or $568,000 decrease in real estate taxes due to
    favorable tax appeals, a 3.3% or $764,000 decrease in repairs
    and maintenance, and a 9.7% or $970,000 decrease in
    administrative and marketing costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
    net operating income divided by property rental income)
    decreased to 68.0% as compared to 68.1% in the comparable period
    in the prior year.

Non-Mature
    Communities

2010-vs.-2009

The remaining $46.7 million and $27.5 million of our
    NOI during the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities.” UDR’s non-mature
    communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria
    to be included in same communities, which include communities
    developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold
    properties, properties classified as real estate held for
    disposition, joint venture properties, properties managed by

third-parties,

and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties, and
    condominium properties. For the year ended December 31,
    2010, we recognized NOI for our developments of
    $15.7 million, acquired communities of $12.7 million,
    redeveloped properties of $12.3 million, and sold
    properties of $980,000. For the year ended December 31,
    2009, we recognized NOI for our developments of
    $6.3 million, acquired communities of $2.8 million,
    redeveloped properties of $11.5 million, and sold
    properties of $1.4 million.

2009-vs.-2008

The remaining $95.2 million and $88.8 million of our
    NOI during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities.” UDR’s non-mature
    communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria
    to be included in same communities, which include communities
    developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold
    properties, properties classified as real estate held for
    disposition, joint venture properties, properties managed by

third-parties,

and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties, and
    condominium properties. For the year ended December 31,
    2009, we recognized NOI for our developments of
    $10.5 million, acquired communities of $54.3 million,
    and redeveloped properties of $24.8 million. For the year
    ended December 31, 2008, we recognized NOI for our
    developments of $2.4 million, acquired communities of
    $38.2 million, redeveloped properties of $22.1 million
    and sold properties of $23.5 million.

Other
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2010, significant amounts
    reflected in other income include: a gain of $4.7 million
    from the sale of marketable securities, a reversal of certain
    tax accruals of $2.1 million, and $3.2 million of fees
    earned for both recurring and non-recurring items related to the
    Company’s joint ventures. For the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, other income also included
    interest income and discount amortization from an interest in a
    convertible debt security of $2.9 million and
    $3.6 million, respectively. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, other income also included
    $5.1 million of interest income from a note for
    $200 million that the Company received related to the
    disposition of 86 properties during 2008. In May 2009, the
    $200 million note was paid in full.

Tax
    Benefit/Expense of TRS

UDR elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated
    as TRS. Income taxes for our TRS are accounted for under the
    asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for future



tax consequences attributable to differences between the
    financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate
    is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date.
    For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a net
    benefit of $2.5 million from the write-off of income taxes
    payable (net of income taxes paid). For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we recognized tax expense of $311,000 to
    the extent of cash taxes paid. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we recognized a benefit of
    $9.7 million in continuing operations due to the results of
    operations and temporary differences associated with the TRS.
    Tax benefits and expenses recognized during the years are
    included in “General and administrative” in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this Report.

Other
    Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses decreased 9.9% or $639,000 for the year
    ended December 31, 2010 from the comparable period in 2009.
    The decrease was due to a number of factors, none of which are
    significant. For the year ended December 31, 2009, other
    operating expenses increased 42.2% or $1.9 million compared
    to the comparable period in 2008. The increase is primarily due
    to additional costs incurred by the Company related to long-term
    ground leases associated with properties acquired in December
    2007 and July 2008. A schedule of future obligations related to
    ground leases is set forth under “Contractual
    Obligations” below.

Real
    Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2010, real estate
    depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
    discontinued operations increased 9.0% or $25.1 million as
    compared to the comparable period in 2009. The increase in
    depreciation and amortization for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 is primarily the result of the
    Company’s acquisition of five communities with 1,374
    apartment homes during 2010, development completions during 2010
    and 2009, and additional capital expenditures. As part of the
    Company’s acquisition activity a portion of the purchase
    price is allocated to intangible assets and are typically
    amortized over a period of less than one year.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, real estate
    depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
    discontinued operations increased 10.5% or $26.4 million as
    compared to the comparable period in 2008. The increase in
    depreciation and amortization for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 is primarily the result of the
    Company’s acquisition of 13 communities with 4,558
    apartment homes during 2008, development completions during 2009
    and 2008, and additional capital expenditures. As part of the
    Company’s acquisition activity a portion of the purchase
    price is allocated to intangible assets and are typically
    amortized over a period of less than one year.

Interest
    Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2010, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations increased 6.1% or
    $8.6 million as compared to 2009. This increase is
    primarily due to the Company’s debt repurchase activity
    during 2010 and 2009. During the year ended December 31,
    2010, we recognized a loss of $1.0 million as a result of
    repurchasing some of our 3.625% convertible Senior Notes in the
    open market as compared to our recognition of $9.8 million
    in gains resulting from the repurchase of unsecured debt
    securities with a notional amount of $238.9 million in the
    open market in 2009. The decrease in our gain from debt
    repurchase activity was partially offset by a decrease of
    $3.8 million of expenses related to the tender of
    $37.5 million of unsecured debt in 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 2.4% or
    $3.5 million as compared to 2008. This decrease is
    primarily due to the Company’s debt repurchase activity
    during 2008 and 2009. During 2009, we recognized a gain of
    $9.8 million as a result of repurchasing unsecured debt
    securities with a notional amount of $238.9 million in the
    open market throughout the year. The gains were partially offset
    by $3.8 million of expenses related to the tender of
    $37.5 million of



unsecured debt and $2.6 million for prepayment penalties
    and the write-off of the fair market value adjustment for
    consolidated joint venture debt. In addition, the weighted
    average interest rate decreased from 4.9% in 2008 to 4.5% in
    2009, which further reduced our interest expense. The decrease
    in the weighted average interest rate during 2009 reflects
    short-term bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had lower
    interest rates in 2009 when compared to the same period in 2008.

General
    and Administrative

For the year ended December 31, 2010, general and
    administrative expenses increased 8.6% or $3.4 million as
    compared to 2009. The increase is primarily due to an increase
    in acquisition costs of $2.9 million related to the
    Company’s acquisitions of five operating communities and
    one parcel of land in 2010; an increase of $4.8 million in
    compensation expense, including deferred compensation and
    bonuses; which was partially offset by a decrease in taxes of
    $1.6 million and an increase in tax benefit, which is
    discussed in “Tax Benefit/Expense of TRS” above.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, general and
    administrative expenses increased 4.7% or $1.8 million as
    compared to 2008. The increase was due to a decrease in tax
    benefit, which is discussed in “Tax Benefit/Expense of
    TRS” above and is offset by a number of factors, including
    the Company writing off acquisition-related costs, the Company
    no longer pursuing a condominium strategy (which resulted in
    writing off $1.7 million in deferred sales charges), the
    renegotiation

and/or

cancellation of certain operating leases

and/or

vendor contracts of $0.8 million, the Company cancelling a
    contract to acquire a pre-sale property (which resulted in a
    charge of $1.7 million), and the acquisitions of certain
    contractual rights related to a joint venture (which resulted in
    the Company incurring a charge of $305,000 for the profit
    component of the contracts which were in recognized in 2008).

Severance
    Costs and Other Restructuring Charges

For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    recognized $6.8 million of severance and restructuring
    charges as the Company consolidated its corporate operations and
    centralized job functions to its Highlands Ranch, Colorado
    headquarters from its Richmond, Virginia office. Also included
    in these charges were severance costs related to the retirement
    of an executive officer.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recognized $653,000 of severance and restructuring charges as
    the Company consolidated its operations in Highlands Ranch,
    Colorado. In addition, we announced reductions to certain
    positions related to both operations and corporate staff.

Gains on
    the Sale of Land and Depreciable Property

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we
    recognized after-tax gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $4.1 million, $2.4 million, and $786.2 million,
    respectively. Changes in the level of gains recognized from
    period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture
    activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains
    related to specific properties sold.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation
    primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities
    and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a
    term of one year or less, which generally enables us to
    compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on
    our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy
    and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and
    their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this
    has had a material impact on our results for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

In connection with the purchase of Hanover’s interests in
    the UDR/MetLife Partnership, UDR agreed to indemnify Hanover
    from liabilities from Hanover’s guaranty of
    $333 million in loans which are secured by a



security interest in the operating community subject to the loan
    at December 31, 2010. The loans are to the

sub-tier

partnerships which own the 26 operating communities. The Company
    anticipates that the balance of these loans will be refinanced
    by the Partnership over the next twelve months.

We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that
    have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future
    effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
    condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations,
    liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
    material.

    contracts, the Company uses the minimum lease payment, if stated
    in the agreement. For ground lease agreements where there is a
    reset provision based on the communities appraised value or

    lease payment, the Company uses the current rent over the
    remainder of the lease term.

During 2010, we incurred gross interest costs of
    $158.6 million, of which $12.5 million was capitalized.

UNITED
    DOMINION REALTY, L.P.:

Business
    Overview

United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the “Operating
    Partnership” or “UDR, L.P.”), is a Delaware
    limited partnership formed in February 2004 and organized
    pursuant to the provisions of the Delaware Revised Uniform
    Limited Partnership Act (as amended from time to time, or any
    successor to such statute, the “Act”). The Operating
    Partnership is the

successor-in-interest

to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed
    under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations on
    November 4, 1995. Our sole general partner is UDR, Inc., a
    Maryland corporation (“UDR” or the “General
    Partner”), which conducts a substantial amount of its
    business and holds a substantial amount of its assets through
    the Operating Partnership. At December 31, 2010, the
    Operating Partnership’s real estate portfolio included 81
    communities located in 8 states plus the District of
    Columbia, with a total of 23,351 apartment homes.

As of December 31, 2010, UDR owned 110,883 units of
    our general limited partnership interests and
    174,736,557 units of our limited partnership interests (the
    “OP Units”), or approximately 97.2% of our
    outstanding OP Units. By virtue of its ownership of our
    OP Units and being our sole general partner, UDR has the
    ability to control all of the

day-to-day

operations of the Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise
    indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all
    references in this Report to the Operating Partnership refer to
    the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated
    subsidiaries, and all references in this “Item 7.
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis — United
    Dominion Realty, L.P.” to “we,” “us” or

    its consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our General Partner
    together with



its consolidated subsidiaries (including us) and the General
    Partner’s consolidated joint ventures as “UDR” or
    the “General Partner.”

UDR operates as a self administered real estate investment
    trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. UDR focuses on
    owning, acquiring, renovating, developing, redeveloping, and
    managing apartment communities in select markets throughout the
    United States. The General Partner was formed in 1972 as a
    Virginia corporation and changed its state of incorporation from
    Virginia to Maryland in September 2003. At December 31,
    2010, the General Partner’s consolidated real estate
    portfolio included 172 communities located in 23 markets with a

We report in two segments: Same Communities and Non-Mature/Other
    Communities. Our Same Communities segment includes those
    communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to
    January 1, 2009, and held as of December 31, 2010.
    These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and
    operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there
    is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and
    the community is not held for disposition within the current
    year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy
    once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive
    months. Our Non-Mature/Other Communities segment includes those
    communities that were acquired or developed in 2008, 2009 or
    2010, sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition, condominium
    conversion properties, joint venture properties, properties
    managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of
    mixed use properties.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial
    obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale of
    properties, and the issuance of debt. Both the coordination of
    asset and liability maturities and effective capital management
    are important to the maintenance of liquidity. The Operating
    Partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from
    operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and
    operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes
    and borrowings allocated to us under the General Partner’s
    credit agreements. The General Partner will routinely use its
    unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing
    and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term
    financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. During
    the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate
    have been used for both investing and financing activities as we
    repositioned our portfolio.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements
    generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings
    allocated to us under the General Partner’s credit
    agreements. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity
    requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential
    property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of
    properties. We believe that our net cash provided by operations
    and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both
    operating requirements and the payment of distributions.
    Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and
    renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from
    property operations and borrowings allocated to us under the
    General Partner’s credit agreements the Operating
    Partnership is a party to.

Future
    Capital Needs

Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with
    proceeds from the issuance of secured debt, the sale of
    properties, the borrowings allocated to us under our General
    Partner’s credit agreements, and to a lesser extent, with
    cash flows provided by operating activities. Acquisition
    activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed
    by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties, the
    issuance of OP Units and the assumption or placement of
    secured debt.

During 2011, we have approximately $42.2 million of secured
    debt maturing and we anticipate that we will repay that debt
    with operating cash flows, proceeds from borrowings allocated to
    us under our General Partner’s credit agreements, or by
    exercising extension rights on such secured debt, as applicable.
    The repayment of debt will be recorded as an offset to the
    “Receivable due from General Partner”.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to use judgment in the application of
    accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.
    A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to
    our financial condition and results of operations and that
    involves some degree of uncertainty. Estimates are prepared
    based on management’s assessment after considering all
    evidence available. Changes in estimates could affect our
    financial position or results of operations. Below is a
    discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical
    to understanding our financial condition or results of
    operations where there is uncertainty or where significant
    judgment is required.



Capital
    Expenditures

In conformity with GAAP, we capitalize those expenditures that
    materially enhance the value of an existing asset or
    substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset.
    Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in
    ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.

During year ended December 31, 2010, $59.5 million was
    spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities as
    compared to $70.4 million for the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2009. These capital improvements included
    turnover-related capital expenditures, revenue enhancing capital
    expenditures, asset preservation expenditures, kitchen and bath
    upgrades, other extensive interior/exterior upgrades and major
    renovations.

We will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing
    improvements which we believe will provide a return on
    investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
    operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
    assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
    estimated to be generated by the future operation and
    disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of
    those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical
    results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market
    and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The
    net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market
    value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best
    estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market
    rates and transactions.

Real
    Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time
    and allocate the purchase price to various components, such as
    land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases in
    accordance with FASB ASC 805,

Business Combinations

(formerly SFAS 141R, “Business
    Combinations”). The purchase price is allocated based on
    the fair value of each component. The fair value of buildings is
    determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and
    subsequently leased at market rental rates. As such, the
    determination of fair value considers the present value of all
    cash flows expected to be generated from the property including
    an initial

lease-up

period. We determine the fair value of in-place leases by
    assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease
    relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In
    addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the
    foregone rents associated with the

lease-up

period, and the carrying costs associated with the

lease-up

period. The fair value of in-place leases is recorded and
    amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual
    lease period.

Statements
    of Cash Flows

The following discussion explains the changes in net cash
    provided by operating activities, net cash (used in)/provided by
    investing activities and net cash used in financing activities
    that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Operating
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash flow
    provided by operating activities was $146.6 million
    compared to $157.3 million for the comparable period in
    2009. The decrease in net cash flow from operating activities is
    primarily due an increase in consolidated net loss, primarily
    due to a decrease in property net operating income and an
    increase in allocated general and administrative costs.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash flow
    provided by operating activities was $157.3 million
    compared to $168.7 million for 2008. The decrease in net
    cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to a
    decrease in property net operating income from our apartment
    community portfolio, a decrease in interest income related to a
    $200 million note receivable that was paid off during 2009
    and higher interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in
    other operating liabilities.



Investing
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash used in
    investing activities was $59.5 million compared to net cash
    provided by investing activities of $129.6 million for the
    comparable period in 2009. This change was primarily due to the
    full payment received on a $200 million note receivable in
    2009. The activity during 2010 consisted entirely of capital
    expenditures.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash provided by
    investing activities was $129.6 million compared to
    $82.0 million for 2008. The increase in cash is primarily
    driven by the proceeds from a $200 million note receivable
    in 2009 and a reduction in acquisition activity and capital
    expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008. This is partially
    offset by the proceeds from dispositions of $880 million in
    2008.

Acquisitions

For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no
    property acquisitions. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, we acquired nine apartment communities with 3,348
    apartment homes for aggregate consideration of
    $713.6 million. The Operating Partnership’s long-term
    strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by
    investing in fewer, more concentrated markets. As a result, we
    have been seeking to expand our interests in communities located
    in California, Metropolitan Washington D.C. and the Washington
    state markets over the past years. Prospectively, we plan to
    continue to channel new investments into those markets we
    believe will continue to provide the best investment returns.
    Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including
    favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability
    and favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing.

Dispositions

During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we did
    not dispose of any communities. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we sold 55 communities with a total of
    16,960 apartment homes, for net proceeds of $880 million.
    We recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $475.2 million on these sales. Proceeds from the sales were
    used primarily to acquire new communities, reduce debt, and
    repay our General Partner.

In conjunction with this transaction, a subsidiary of the
    Operating Partnership received a note in the amount of
    $200 million. The note was paid in full in 2009.

Financing
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2010, our net cash used in
    financing activities was $86.7 million compared to
    $290.1 million for 2009. The decrease in cash used in
    financing activities was primarily due to a net decrease in
    payments to the General Partner, partially offset by a decrease
    in the proceeds from secured debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash used in
    financing activities was $290.1 million compared to
    $247.2 million for the comparable period of 2008. The
    increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due
    to a net increase in payments to the General Partner, which was
    partially offset by the net activity on secured debt.

Credit
    Facilities

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the General Partner had
    secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate
    commitment of $1.4 billion with $1.2 billion
    outstanding. The Fannie Mae credit facilities are for an initial
    term of 10 years, bear interest at floating and fixed
    rates, and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for
    an additional five years at the General Partner’s option.
    At December 31, 2010, $897.3 million of the funded
    balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%
    and the remaining balance on these facilities was at a weighted
    average variable rate of 1.7%. At December 31, 2010,
    $736.9 million of these credit facilities are allocated to
    the Operating Partnership based on the ownership of the assets
    securing the debt.



At December 31, 2009, there was $950 million of the
    funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%
    and the remaining balance on these facilities was at a weighted
    average variable rate of 1.7%. $750.4 million of these
    credit facilities were allocated to the Operating Partnership at
    December 31, 2009 based on the ownership of the assets
    securing the debt.

The Operating Partnership is a guarantor on the General
    Partner’s unsecured credit facility, with an aggregate
    borrowing capacity of $600 million, on a $100 million
    term loan, and on the $250 million term loan facility. At
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the
    outstanding balance under the unsecured credit facility was
    $31.8 million and $189.3 million, respectively.

The credit facilities are subject to customary financial
    covenants and limitations.

Other
    Guarantees

At December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership guaranteed
    certain outstanding securities of UDR, such that the Operating
    Partnership, as primary obligor and not merely as surety,
    irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the
    applicable securities and to the trustee and their successors
    and assigns under the respective indenture (a) the full and
    punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by
    acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of UDR under the
    respective indenture whether for principal of or interest on the
    securities (and premium, if any), and all other monetary
    obligations of UDR under the respective indenture and the terms
    of the applicable securities and (b) the full and punctual
    performance within the applicable grace periods of all other
    obligations of UDR under the respective indenture and the terms
    of the applicable securities.

Interest
    Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable
    rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced.
    We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other
    speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial
    instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets.
    Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in
    market interest rates and the fair value of market rate
    sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as
    changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable
    rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. We had
    $303.5 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to
    interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2010. If
    market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by
    100 basis points, our interest expense would increase by
    $3 million based on the balance at December 31, 2010.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of
    hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These
    analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of
    overall economic activity that could exist in such an
    environment. Further, in the event of a change of such
    magnitude, management would likely take actions to further
    mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the
    uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and
    their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no
    change in our financial structure.

Results
    of Operations

The following discussion explains the changes in results of
    operations that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, and includes the results of both
    continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented.



Net
    (Loss)/Income Attributable to OP Unitholders

2010-vs.-2009

Net loss attributable to OP unit holders was $20.7 million
    ($0.12 per OP unit) for the year ended December 31, 2010 as
    compared to $4.2 million ($0.02 per OP unit) for the
    comparable period in the prior year. The increase in net loss
    attributable to OP unit holders for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 resulted primarily from the following
    items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere
    within this Report:

•

a decrease in net operating income (“NOI”);

•

an increase in general and administrative expenses allocated to
    us by our General Partner; and

•

a decrease in other income.

2009-vs.-2008

Net loss attributable to OP unit holders was $4.2 million
    ($0.02 per OP unit) for the year ended December 31, 2009 as
    compared to net income attributable to OP unit holders of
    $497.7 million ($3.00 per OP unit) for the comparable
    period in the prior year. The decrease in net income
    attributable to OP unit holders for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 resulted primarily from the following
    items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere
    within this Report:

•

a reduction in disposition gains in 2009 as compared to 2008. We
    recognized net gains of $1.5 million and
    $475.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively;

•

a decrease in net operating income due to the disposition of
    properties in 2008;

•

an increase in interest expense incurred on new debt;

•

an increase in depreciation expense primarily due to the
    acquisition of operating properties in 2008; and

•

a decrease in other income primarily due to a decrease in
    interest income.

Apartment
    Community Operations

Our net income is primarily generated from the operation of our
    apartment communities.

Same
    Store Communities

2010-vs.-2009

Our same store communities (those acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to January 1, 2009 and held on
    December 31, 2010) consisted of 22,104 apartment homes
    and provided 93.7% of our total NOI for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

NOI for our same store community properties decreased 2.7% or
    $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease in property
    NOI was primarily attributable to a 1.4% or $4.6 million
    decrease in property rental income and by a 1.4% or
    $1.5 million increase in operating expenses. The decrease
    in revenues was primarily driven by a 2.9% or $9.4 million
    decrease in rental rates which was partially offset by a 4.9% or
    $1.2 million increase in reimbursement income. Physical
    occupancy increased 0.4% to 95.6% and total income per occupied
    home decreased $24 to $1,287 for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior year.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 3.6% or $582,000 increase in utilities, a $764,000 or 4.8%
    increase in repairs and maintenance, and a 3.1% or $767,000
    increase in personnel costs which was partially offset by a 1.6%
    or $571,000 decrease in real estate taxes and a 3.7% or $252,000
    decrease in administrative and marketing costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
    net operating income divided by property rental income) was
    67.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to
    68.1% for the comparable period in 2009.

2009-vs.-2008

Our same store communities (those acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to January 1, 2008 and held on
    December 31, 2009) consisted of 17,332 apartment homes
    and provided 72% of our total NOI for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

NOI for our same store community properties decreased 2.5% or
    $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in property
    NOI was primarily attributable to a 2.4% or $6.2 million
    decrease in property rental income, which was partially offset
    by a 2.3% or $1.8 million decrease in operating expenses.
    The decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a 3.1% or
    $7.7 million decrease in rental rates and a 52.1% or
    $573,000 increase in bad debt which was offset by an 13.7% or
    $1.6 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 7.3% or
    $739,000 increase in reimbursement income. Physical occupancy
    increased 0.3% to 95.3% and total income per occupied home
    decreased $23 to $1,266.



The decrease in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 6.0% or $223,000 decrease in insurance, a 2.1% or $249,000
    decrease in utilities, a 5.5% or $706,000 decrease in repairs
    and maintenance, a 38.3% or $298,000 decrease in incentive
    bonuses, and a 6.6% or $365,000 decrease in administrative and
    marketing costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
    net operating income divided by property rental income) was
    69.3% during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Non-Mature/Other
    Communities

2010-vs.-2009

The remaining $14.8 million and $15.2 million of our
    NOI during the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities.” Our non-mature communities
    consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be
    included in same store communities, which includes communities
    developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold
    properties, properties managed by third-parties, the
    non-apartment components of mixed use properties, and properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition. For the year
    ended December 31, 2010, we recognized NOI for
    redevelopments of $10.2 million. The remainder was
    primarily due to the non-apartment components of mixed use
    properties. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we
    recognized NOI for redeveloped properties of $9.5 million.
    The remaining NOI was primarily due to the non-apartment
    components of mixed use properties.

2009-vs.-2008

The remaining $66.8 million and $67.8 million of our
    NOI during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities.” Our non-mature communities
    consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be
    included in same store communities, which includes communities
    developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold properties
    and properties classified as real estate held for disposition.
    For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized NOI for
    our acquired communities of $49.3 million and
    redevelopments of $11.8 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we recognized NOI for our acquired
    communities of $35.5 million, sold communities of
    $15.2 million, and redeveloped properties of
    $11.8 million.

Other
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2010, other income
    primarily includes a reversal of certain real estate tax
    accruals partially offset by losses due to the change in the
    fair value of derivatives.

For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, other
    income primarily includes interest income on a note for
    $200 million that a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership
    received related to the disposition of 55 properties during
    2008. In May 2009, the $200 million note was paid in full.

Real
    Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, real estate
    depreciation and amortization did not change significantly as
    the Operating Partnership did not have any acquisitions or
    dispositions during these respective periods.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, real estate
    depreciation and amortization increased 7.9% or
    $12.2 million as compared to the comparable period in 2008.
    The increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 is primarily the result of the
    acquisition of nine communities with 3,348 apartment homes
    during 2008, and additional capital expenditures. As part of the
    Operating Partnership’s acquisition activity a portion of
    the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and are
    typically amortized over a period of less than one year.



Interest
    Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2010, interest expense
    decreased 2.5% or $1.3 million, as compared to the same
    period in 2009. This decrease is primarily due a decrease in the
    interest rate charged on the note payable due to the General
    Partner partially offset by slightly higher average borrowings
    on secured credit facilities.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations increased 14.7% or
    $6.9 million as compared to 2008. This increase is
    primarily due to additional borrowings on FNMA credit facilities
    offset by debt repayments and maturities.

General
    and Administrative

The Operating Partnership is charged directly for general and
    administrative expenses it incurs. The Operating Partnership is
    also charged for other general and administrative expenses that
    have been allocated by UDR to each of its subsidiaries,
    including the Operating Partnership, based on each
    subsidiary’s pro-rata portion of UDR’s total apartment
    homes.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, general and
    administrative expenses increased 37.9% or $6.4 million, as
    compared to the comparable period in 2009. The increase was due
    to a number of factors including acquisition-related costs and
    severance and other restructuring charges recognized in 2010.
    The increases were consistent with the changes in UDR’s
    general and administrative expenses and severance and other
    restructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, general and
    administrative expenses decreased 11.5% or $2.2 million as
    compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a number of
    factors including the write off of acquisition-related costs and
    severance and restructuring costs recognized in 2008.

Income
    from Discontinued Operations

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we
    recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of $152,000,
    $1.5 million and $475.2 million, respectively. Changes
    in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect
    the residual activities from specific properties sold.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation
    primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities
    and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a
    term of one year or less, which generally enables us to
    compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on
    our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy
    and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and
    their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this
    has had a material impact on our results for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Operating Partnership is a guarantor on the General
    Partner’s unsecured credit facility, with an aggregate
    borrowing capacity of $600 million, a $100 million
    term loan, and a $250 million term loan. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding balance under
    the unsecured credit facility was $31.8 million and
    $189.3 million, respectively.

On September 30, 2010, the Operating Partnership guaranteed
    certain outstanding debt securities of the General Partner.
    These guarantees provide that the Operating Partnership, as
    primary obligor and not merely as surety, irrevocably and
    unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the applicable
    securities and to the trustee and their successors and assigns
    under the respective indenture (a) the full and punctual
    payment when due, whether as stated maturity, by acceleration or
    otherwise, of all obligations of the General Partner under the
    respective indenture whether for principal or interest on the
    securities (and premium, if any), and all other monetary
    obligations of the General Partner under the respective
    indenture and the terms of the applicable



securities and (b) the full and punctual performance within
    the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the
    General Partner under the respective indenture and the terms of
    applicable securities.

We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that
    have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future
    effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
    condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations,
    liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
    material.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

The disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the
    Operating Partnership are designed with the objective of
    ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our
    reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
    that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is
    based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
    future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
    will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
    future conditions, regardless of how remote. As a result, our
    disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that such disclosure controls and
    procedures will meet their objectives.

As of December 31, 2010, we carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, of
    the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure
    controls and procedures of the Company and the Operating
    Partnership. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company concluded
    that the



disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the
    Operating Partnership are effective at the reasonable assurance
    level described above.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of UDR, Inc. is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of the management, the Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer of UDR, Inc. conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
    reporting based on the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO). Based on such
    evaluation, management concluded that UDR, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2010.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Report, has audited UDR, Inc.’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. The report of Ernst & Young
    LLP, which expresses an unqualified opinion on UDR, Inc.’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, is included under the heading
    “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm” of UDR, Inc. contained in this Report.

This Report does not include a report of management’s
    assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting
    of United Dominion Realty, L.P. or an attestation report of the
    registered public accounting firm of United Dominion Realty,
    L.P. due to a transition period established by the rules of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public companies.
    Further, an attestation report of the registered public
    accounting firm of United Dominion Realty, L.P. will not be
    required as long as United Dominion Realty, L.P. is a
    non-accelerated filer.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have not been any changes in either the Company’s or
    the Operating Partnership’s internal control over financial
    reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the fourth fiscal quarter to
    which this report relates that materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control
    over financial reporting of either the Company or the Operating
    Partnership.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

UDR, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    UDR, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2010
    and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income/(loss), and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of UDR, Inc. at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), UDR,
    Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

    Young LLP

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of UDR, Inc.

We have audited UDR, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). UDR, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, UDR, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of UDR, Inc. as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
    income/(loss), and cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2010 of UDR, Inc. and our report
    dated February 23, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2010

1.

CONSOLIDATION
    AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Organization,
    formation and special dividend

UDR, Inc. (“UDR”, the “Company”
    “we” or “our”) is a self-administered real
    estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires,
    renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages apartment
    communities generally in high

barrier-to-entry

markets located in the United States. The high

barrier-to-entry

markets are characterized by limited land for new construction,
    difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive
    single-family home prices and significant employment growth
    potential. At December 31, 2010, our apartment portfolio
    consisted of 172 consolidated communities located in 23 markets
    consisting of 48,553 apartment homes. In addition, the Company
    has an ownership interest in 9,891 apartment homes through
    unconsolidated joint ventures.

On November 5, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend of $1.29 per share (“the Special Dividend”)
    payable to holders of our Common Stock. The Special Dividend was
    paid on January 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on
    December 9, 2008. The Special Dividend represented the
    Company’s 2008 fourth quarter recurring distribution of
    $0.33 per share and an additional special distribution in the
    amount of $0.96 per share due to taxable income arising from our
    disposition activity occurring during the year. Subject to the
    Company’s right to pay the entire Special Dividend in cash,
    stockholders had the option to make an election to receive
    payment in cash or in shares, however, the aggregate amount of
    cash payable to stockholders, other than cash payable in lieu of
    fractional shares, would not be less than $44.0 million.

The Special Dividend, totaling $177.1 million was paid on
    137,266,557 Common Shares issued and outstanding on the record
    date. Approximately $133.1 million of the Special Dividend
    was paid through the issuance of 11,358,042 shares of
    Common Stock, which was determined based on the volume weighted
    average closing sales price of our Common Stock of $11.71 per
    share on the NYSE on January 21, 2009 and January 22,
    2009. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board’s (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
    Update

2010-01,

Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components
    of Stock and Cash

(“ASU

2010-01”),

which considers distributions that contain components of cash
    and stock and allows shareholders to select their preferred form
    of distribution. Such a distribution, to the extent paid in
    stock, is now treated as a stock issuance on the date the
    dividend is paid. At December 31, 2008, the Company accrued
    $133.1 million of distribution payable related to the
    Special Dividend. ASU

2010-01

was
    effective for the Company on December 15, 2009 and was
    applied on a retrospective basis. As a result, the Company
    reversed the effect of the issuance of additional shares of
    Common Stock pursuant to the Special Dividend, which was
    retroactively reflected in each of the historical periods
    presented within the Company’s

Form 8-K

filed with the SEC on May 22, 2009, and effectively issued
    these shares on January 29, 2009 (the payment date of the
    Special Dividend). For the year ended December 31, 2008,
    basic and diluted net income attributable to Common Stockholders
    per weighted average common share prior to retrospective
    adjustment was $4.89. This was based on weighted average common
    shares of 140,982,000 (basic and diluted) for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Basis of
    presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of UDR and
    its wholly-owned subsidiaries includes certain joint ventures,
    which the Company previously accounted for as investments under
    the equity method (see Note 5,

Joint Ventures

    further discussion). All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company’s subsidiaries include United Dominion Realty,
    L.P., (the “Operating Partnership”), and Heritage
    Communities L.P. (the “Heritage OP”). As of
    December 31, 2010, there were 179,909,408 units in the
    Operating Partnership outstanding, of which
    174,847,440 units or 97.2% were owned by UDR and

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

No. 2010-06,

“Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements”
    an amendment to ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures.” This amendment provides for more robust
    disclosures about (1) the different classes of assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value, (2) the valuation
    techniques and inputs used, (3) the activity in
    Level 3 fair value measurements, and (4) the transfers
    between Levels 1, 2, and 3. ASU

No. 2010-06

was effective for the Company for our fiscal year beginning in
    January 1, 2010.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-29,

which addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation
    of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements
    for business combinations. The amendments in ASU

2010-29

specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial
    statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of
    the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that
    occurred during the current year had occurred as of the
    beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
    The amendments in ASU

2010-29

also
    expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a
    description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring
    pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business
    combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and
    earnings. The amendments in

ASU 2010-29

are effective prospectively for business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2010.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
    disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the
    financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid
    could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to
    conform to the current financial statement presentation.

Investment
    in joint ventures

We use the equity method to account for investments that qualify
    as variable interest entities where we are not the primary
    beneficiary and entities that we do not control or where we do
    not own a majority of the economic interest but have the ability
    to exercise significant influence over the operating and
    financial policies of the investee. Throughout these financial
    statements we use the term “joint venture” when
    referring to entities in which we do not have a 100% ownership
    interest. The Company will also use the equity method when we
    function as the managing member and our joint venture partner
    has substantive participating rights or where we can be replaced
    by our joint venture partner as managing member without cause.
    For a joint venture accounted for under the equity method, our
    share of net earnings or losses is reflected as income when
    earned and distributions are credited against our investment in
    the joint venture as received.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In determining whether a joint venture is a variable interest
    entity, the Company considers: the form of our ownership
    interest and legal structure; the size of our investment; the
    financing structure of the entity, including necessity of
    subordinated debt; estimates of future cash flows; ours and our
    partner’s ability to participate in the decision making
    related to acquisitions, disposition, budgeting and financing of
    the entity; obligation to absorb losses and preferential
    returns; nature of our partner’s primary operations; and
    the degree, if any, of disproportionally between the economic
    and voting interests of the entity. As of December 31,
    2010, the Company did not assess any of our joint ventures as
    variable interest entities where UDR was the primary beneficiary.

We continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint
    ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    there may be an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a
    decrease in the value of the investment is

other-than-temporary.

These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the
    venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the
    entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the
    entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture
    partners and its lenders. The amount of loss recognized is the
    excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its
    estimated fair value. If we believe that the decline in fair
    value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. The
    aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in
    determining the valuation of our equity method investments.
    Should the actual results differ from management’s
    judgment, the valuation could be negatively affected and may
    result in a negative impact to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Discontinued
    operations

For properties accounted for under FASB ASC 360,

Property, Plant and Equipment

(formerly

SFAS

144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets”) (“Topic 360”), the results of
    operations for those properties sold during the year or
    classified as

held-for-sale

at the end of the current year are classified as discontinued
    operations in the current and prior periods. Further, to meet
    the discontinued operations criteria, the Company will not have
    any significant continuing involvement in the ownership or
    operation of the property after the sale or disposition. Once a
    property is deemed as

held-for-sale,

depreciation is no longer recorded. However, if the Company
    determines that the property no longer meets the criteria for

held-for-sale,

the Company will recapture any unrecorded depreciation on the
    property. The sales related to condominium units are also
    included in discontinued operations (see Note 4,

Discontinued Operations

for further discussion).

Real
    estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical
    cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements, furniture,
    fixtures and equipment and other costs incurred during their
    development, acquisition and redevelopment.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are
    charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements,
    renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition

and/or

improvement of real estate assets are capitalized and
    depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the
    expenditures qualify as a betterment or the life of the related
    asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life
    expectancy.

UDR purchases real estate investment properties and allocates
    the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired based on their estimated fair value. The
    primary, although not only, identifiable intangible asset
    associated with our portfolio is the value of existing lease
    agreements. When allocating cost to an acquired community, we
    first allocate costs to the estimated intangible value of the
    existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the
    land, building and fixtures assuming the community is vacant.
    The Company estimates the intangible value of the lease
    agreements by determining the lost revenue associated with a
    hypothetical

lease-up.

Depreciation on the building is based on the expected



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

useful life of the asset and the in-place leases are amortized
    over their remaining contractual life. Property acquisition
    costs are expensed as incurred.

Quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant, UDR will
    assess our real estate portfolio for indicators of impairment.
    In determining whether the Company has indicators of impairment
    in our real estate assets, we assess whether the long-lived
    asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s
    undiscounted future cash flows, which is representative of
    projected NOI plus the residual value of the community. Our
    future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results
    adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and
    operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. If such
    indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value
    exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the
    carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. Our
    estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based
    primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates,
    operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization
    rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and
    transactions.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are
    recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost
    to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition generally
    represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted
    for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next
    twelve months. Real estate held for disposition is carried at
    the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair
    value, less the cost to dispose, determined on an

asset-by-asset

basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on
    held for disposition properties are charged to expense as
    incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and
    replacements related to held for disposition properties are
    capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate
    held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets which are
    35 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major
    improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures,
    equipment, and other assets. As of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the value of our net intangible assets which are reflected
    in “Other assets” was $13.3 million and
    $7.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the value of our net intangible liabilities which are
    reflected in “Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other
    liabilities” was $3.9 million and $5.2 million in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balances are being
    amortized over the remaining life of the respective intangible.

All development projects and related carrying costs are
    capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
    “Real estate under development.” As each building in a
    project is completed and becomes available for

lease-up,

the total cost of the building is transferred to real estate
    held for investment and the assets are depreciated over their
    estimated useful lives. The costs of development projects which
    include interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated
    development overhead related to support costs for personnel
    working directly on the development site are capitalized during
    the construction period. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, total
    interest capitalized was $12.5 million, $16.9 million,
    and $14.9 million, respectively.

Cash and
    cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand
    deposits with financial institutions and short-term, highly
    liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid investments
    with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. The majority of the Company’s cash and
    cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks.

Restricted
    cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for
    real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and
    security deposits.



UDR,
    INC.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Escrow —
    1031 exchange funds

In most cases, disposition proceeds are set aside and designated
    to fund future tax-deferred exchanges of qualifying real estate
    investments. If these proceeds are not redeployed to qualifying
    real estate investment within 180 days, these funds are
    redesignated as cash and cash equivalents.

Derivative
    financial instruments

The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage
    interest rate risk and will generally designate these financial
    instruments as cash flow hedges. Derivative financial
    instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as
    either an asset or liability and measured quarterly at their
    fair value. The changes in fair value for cash flow hedges that
    are deemed effective are reflected in other comprehensive income
    and for non-designated derivative financial instruments in
    earnings. The ineffective component of cash flow hedges, if any,
    is recorded in earnings.

Cost of
    raising capital

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of equity
    securities are deducted from stockholders’ equity. Costs
    incurred in connection with the issuance or renewal of debt are
    subject to the provisions of

FASB ASC 470-50,

Debt Modification and Extinguishment

(formerly

EITF 96-19,

“Debtors’ Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments”). Accordingly, if the terms of the
    renewed or modified debt instrument are deemed to be
    substantially different (i.e. a 10 percent or greater
    difference in the cash flows between instruments), all
    unamortized financing costs associated with the extinguished
    debt are charged to earnings in the current period. When the
    cash flows are not substantially different, the costs associated
    with the renewal or modification are capitalized and amortized
    into interest expense over the remaining term of the related
    debt instrument and other related costs are expensed. The
    balance of any unamortized financing costs associated with
    retired debt is expensed upon retirement. Deferred financing
    costs for new debt instruments include fees and costs incurred
    by the Company to obtain financing. Deferred financing costs are
    generally amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates
    the effective interest method, over a period not to exceed the
    term of the related debt.

Preferred
    Share repurchases

When repurchasing Preferred Stock, the Company recognizes share
    issuance costs as a charge to the Preferred Stock on a pro rata
    basis to the total costs incurred for the Preferred Stock
    offering. The Company, during the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009, and 2008, recognized share issuance costs of
    $23,000, $853,000, and $829,000, respectively as part of the
    amount reported in “Discount/(premium) on Preferred Stock
    repurchases, net” in the Consolidated Statement of
    Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income/(Loss).

Comprehensive
    income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in equity
    during each period except for those resulting from investments
    by or distributions to stockholders, is displayed in the
    accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
    Equity and Comprehensive Income/(Loss). For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, other comprehensive income/(loss)
    consisted of the change in fair value of marketable securities,
    the change in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges from
    our consolidated subsidiaries, and the allocation of other
    comprehensive income/(loss) to redeemable non-controlling
    interests. (See Note 5,

Joint Ventures

for further
    discussion.)



UDR,

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue
    and real estate sales gain recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual
    basis when due from residents in accordance with FASB
    ASC 840,

Leases

(formerly SFAS 13
    “Accounting for Leases”) and SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition”.
    Rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis and
    recognized when earned. The Company recognizes interest income,
    management and other fees and incentives when earned, fixed and
    determinable.

The Company accounts for sales of real estate in accordance with
    FASB

ASC 360-20,

Real Estate Sales

(formerly SFAS 66,
    “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”). For sale
    transactions meeting the requirements for full accrual profit
    recognition, such as the Company no longer having continuing
    involvement in the property, we remove the related assets and
    liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record the
    gain or loss in the period the transaction closes. For sale
    transactions that do not meet the full accrual sale criteria due
    to our continuing involvement, we evaluate the nature of the
    continuing involvement and account for the transaction under an
    alternate method of accounting.

Sales to entities in which we retain or otherwise own an
    interest are accounted for as partial sales. If all other
    requirements for recognizing profit under the full accrual
    method have been satisfied and no other forms of continuing
    involvement are present, we recognize profit proportionate to
    the outside interest in the buyer and will defer the gain on the
    interest we retain. The Company will recognize any deferred gain
    when the property is then sold to a third party. In transactions
    accounted by us as partial sales, we determine if the buyer of
    the majority equity interest in the venture was provided a
    preference as to cash flows in either an operating or a capital
    waterfall. If a cash flow preference has been provided, we
    recognize profit only to the extent that proceeds from the sale
    of the majority equity interest exceed costs related to the
    entire property.

Advertising
    costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item
    “Administrative and marketing”. During 2010, 2009, and
    2008, total advertising expense was $6.4 million,
    $5.7 million, and $6.1 million, respectively.

Stock-based
    employee compensation plans

UDR accounts for its stock-based employee compensation plans in
    accordance with FASB ASC 718,

Compensation- Stock
    Compensation

(formerly SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based
    Payments”). This standard requires an entity to measure the
    cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
    an equity instrument based on the award’s fair value on the
    grant date and recognize the cost over the period during which
    the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the
    award, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value for
    stock options issued by the Company is calculated utilizing the
    Black-Scholes-Merton formula. For performance based awards, the
    Company remeasures the fair value each balance sheet date with
    adjustments made on a cumulative basis until the award is
    settled and the final compensation is known.

Redeemable
    non-controlling interests in the Operating Partnership

Interests in operating partnerships held by limited partners are
    represented by operating partnership units
    (“OP Units”). Income is allocated to holders of
    OP Units based upon net income available to common
    stockholders and the weighted average number of OP Units
    outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units
    outstanding during the period. Capital contributions,
    distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to
    non-controlling interests in accordance with the terms of the
    individual partnership agreements.

Limited partners have the right to require the Operating
    Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held
    by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the
    form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the limited partnership
    agreement of the Operating Partnership (the “Partnership
    Agreement”)),



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

provided that such OP Units have been outstanding for at
    least one year. UDR, as the general partner of the Operating
    Partnership may, in its sole discretion, purchase the
    OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash
    Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of Common
    Stock of the Company for each OP Unit), as defined in the
    Partnership Agreement. Accordingly, the Company records the
    OP Units outside of permanent equity and reports the
    OP Units at their redemption value at each balance sheet
    date.

Earnings
    per share

Basic earnings per Common Share is computed based upon the
    weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding during the
    year. Diluted earnings per Common Share is computed based upon
    Common Shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive stock
    options and other potentially dilutive Common Stock equivalents.
    The dilutive effect of OP units, stock options and other
    potentially dilutive Common Stock equivalents is determined
    using the treasury stock method based on UDR’s average
    stock price. The number of shares used to compute basic and
    dilutive earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the
    Special Dividend during the year ended December 31, 2009.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
    diluted earning per share

The effect of the conversion of the OP Units, convertible
    Preferred Stock, convertible debt, stock options, and restricted
    stock is not dilutive and is therefore not included in the above
    calculations as the Company reported a loss from continuing
    operations.

If the operating partnership units were converted to Common
    Stock, the additional shares of Common Stock outstanding for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 would be
    5,711,275; 6,705,624; and 8,751,367 weighted average Common
    Shares, respectively.

If the convertible Preferred Stock were converted to Common
    Stock, the additional shares of Common Stock outstanding would
    be 3,035,548 weighted average Common Shares for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and 2,803,812 weighted average
    Common Shares for the year ended December 31, 2008.

If the stock options and unvested restricted stock were
    converted to Common Stock, the additional weighted average
    Common Shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for
    the three years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008
    would be 2,296,097; 729,592; and 1,129,907 weighted average
    Common Shares, respectively.

Income
    taxes

UDR is operated as, and elects to be taxed as a REIT. Generally,
    a REIT complies with the provisions of the Code if it meets
    certain requirements concerning its income and assets, as well
    as if it distributes at least

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and will not
    be subject to U.S. federal income taxes if it distributes
    at least 100% of its income. Accordingly, no provision has been
    made for federal income taxes of the REIT. UDR is subject to
    certain state and local excise or franchise taxes, for which
    provision has been made. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any
    taxable year, our taxable income will be subject to United
    States Federal income tax at regular corporate rates (including
    any applicable alternative minimum tax). Even if we qualify as a
    REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local income taxes
    and to United States Federal income tax. We also will be
    required to pay a 100% tax on non-arms length transactions
    between us and a taxable REIT subsidiary and on any net income
    from sales of property that the IRS successfully asserts was
    property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course.

UDR elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated
    as Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (“TRS”) relating to the
    Company’s development activities. Income taxes for our TRS
    are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
    tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax
    consequences attributable to differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
    and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate
    is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date.

Market
    concentration risk

Approximately 11% and 10% of our apartment communities are
    located in Orange County, California and Metropolitan Washington
    D.C., respectively, based on the carrying value of our real
    estate portfolio as of December 31, 2010. Therefore, the
    Company is subject to increased exposure (positive or negative)
    from economic and other competitive factors specific to these
    markets.

The purchase price is the contractual amount paid by UDR to the
    third party and does not include any costs that the Company
    incurred in the pursuit of the property.

The $412 million purchase price, which includes assumed
    debt with a fair value of $93.3 million, was allocated
    $81.1 million to land; $317.7 million to building and
    improvements; $3.1 million to furniture, fixtures, and
    equipment; and $10.1 million to intangible assets.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company also
    acquired land located in San Francisco, California with a
    purchase price of $23.6 million.

The Company incurred $2.9 million and $0 of
    acquisition-related costs during the years ended 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. These expenses are classified on the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations in the line item entitled “General
    and administrative.”

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    acquired one community with 289 apartment homes in Dallas,
    Texas. The purchase related to an agreement previously entered
    into by UDR, which contains provisions that will require the
    Company and the builder to jointly agree upon the fair market
    value of each property at a later point in time (generally
    within two years of stabilization). A percentage of the increase
    in the fair market value over cost will then be paid to the
    developer, ranging from 50% to 70%, which is not included in the
    initial purchase price of $28.5 million nor is the
    contingent obligation accrued for by the Company.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

The results of operations for properties sold during the year or
    designated as

held-for-sale

at the end of the year are classified as discontinued operations
    for all periods presented. Properties classified as real estate
    held for disposition generally represent properties that are
    actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing
    expected to occur within the next twelve months. The application
    of Topic 360 does not have an impact on net income available to
    common stockholders. The application of Topic 360 results in the
    reclassification of the operating results of all properties sold
    or classified as held for disposition through December 31,
    2010, within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, and the
    reclassification of the assets and liabilities within the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, if applicable. The results of operations from these
    properties are classified on the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations in the line item entitled “Income from
    discontinued operations.”

During the year ended December 31, 2010, UDR sold one 149
    apartment home community. UDR recognized gains for financial
    reporting purposes of $4 million on this sale, which is
    included in discontinued operations.

JOINT
    VENTURES

UDR has entered into joint ventures with unrelated third parties
    for real estate assets that are either consolidated and included
    in real estate owned on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or are
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which are
    not consolidated and are included in investment in
    unconsolidated joint ventures on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. The Company consolidates an entity in which we own less
    than 100% but control the joint venture as well as any variable
    interest entity where we are the primary beneficiary. In
    addition, the Company consolidates any joint venture in which we
    are the general partner or managing member and the third party
    does not have the ability to substantively participate in the
    decision-making process nor do they have the ability to remove
    us as general partner or managing member without cause.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

UDR’s joint ventures are funded with a combination of debt
    and equity. Our losses are limited to our investment and except
    as noted below, the Company does not guarantee any debt, capital
    payout or other obligations associated with our joint venture
    portfolio.

Consolidated
    Joint Ventures

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“989 Elements”) which owns and operates a
    23-story, 166 home high-rise apartment community in the central
    business district of Bellevue, Washington. On December 30,
    2009, UDR entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase
    its 49% interest in 989 Elements for $7.7 million.
    Concurrently, our partner resigned as managing member and
    appointed UDR as managing member. In addition, our partner
    relinquished its voting rights and approval rights and its
    ability to substantively participate in the decision-making
    process of the joint venture resulting in the consolidation of
    the joint venture. The joint venture assets and liabilities were
    recorded at fair value. The fair value of the assets was
    $55 million ($54.8 million of real estate owned and
    $200,000 of current assets) and the fair value of liabilities
    was $34.1 million ($33.4 million of a construction
    loan, net of fair market value adjustment of $1.6 million
    and $700,000 of current liabilities) at the consolidation date.
    During the year ended December 31, 2009, UDR recognized a
    gain on the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest
    in the joint venture, acquired assets and assumed liabilities to
    fair value of $3.4 million and is included in “Gain on
    consolidation of joint ventures” on our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

On December 31, 2009, the Company repaid the outstanding
    balance of $35 million on the construction loan held by 989
    Elements. As a result, the Company wrote off the adjustment to
    record the fair value of the construction loan assumed on
    December 30, 2009 of $1.6 million and is included in
    “Write off of fair market value adjustment” on our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. In March 2010, the Company paid
    $7.7 million and acquired our partner’s 49% interest
    in the joint venture. At the closing of the agreement and at
    December 31, 2010, the Company’s interest in 989
    Elements was 98%. The activities and accounts of 989 Elements
    are included in the Company’s consolidated financial
    position as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and consolidated
    results of operations and cash flows during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and the two day period ending
    December 31, 2009.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Elements Too”) which owns and operates a 274
    home apartment community in the central business district of
    Bellevue, Washington. Construction began in the fourth quarter
    of 2006 and was completed in the first quarter of 2010. On
    October 16, 2009, our partner resigned as managing member
    and appointed UDR as managing member. In addition, our partner
    relinquished its voting rights and approval rights and its
    ability to substantively participate in the decision-making
    process of the joint venture resulting in the consolidation of
    the joint venture. The joint venture assets and liabilities were
    recorded at fair value. Prior to consolidation, our equity
    investment in Elements Too was $24.4 million (net of an
    $11 million impairment loss discussed below) at
    October 16, 2009. The fair value of the assets was
    $100.3 million ($99.5 million of real estate owned and
    $814,000 of other assets) and the fair value of liabilities was
    $75.6 million ($70.5 million of a construction loan,
    $917,000 of a derivative instrument, and $4.2 million of
    other liabilities). During the year ended December 31,
    2009, UDR recognized a loss on the remeasurement of our
    previously held equity interest in the joint venture, acquired
    assets and assumed liabilities to fair value of
    $1.9 million and is included in “Gain on consolidation
    of joint ventures” on our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into an agreement with
    our partner to purchase its 49% interest in Elements Too for
    $3.2 million. In March 2010, the Company paid the
    outstanding balance of $3.2 million and acquired our
    partner’s 49% interest in the joint venture. At the closing
    of the agreement and at December 31, 2010, the
    Company’s interest in Elements Too was 98%. During the year
    ended December 31, 2010, the Company repaid the outstanding
    balance of $70.5 million on the construction loan held by
    Elements Too. The activities and accounts of Elements Too are
    included in the Company’s consolidated financial position

    operations and cash flows during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and the seventy-six day period ending
    December 31, 2009.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Bellevue”) which owns an operating retail
    site in Bellevue, Washington. The Company initially planned to
    develop a 430 home high rise apartment building with ground
    floor retail on an existing operating retail center. However,
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, the joint venture
    decided to continue to operate the retail property as opposed to
    developing a high rise apartment building on the site. On
    December 30, 2009, UDR entered into an agreement with our
    partner to purchase its 49% interest in Bellevue for
    $5.2 million. In addition, our partner resigned as managing
    member and appointed UDR as managing member. Concurrent with its
    resignation, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture resulting in
    the consolidation of the joint venture at fair value. Prior to
    consolidation, our equity investment in Bellevue was
    $5 million (net of a $5 million impairment loss
    discussed below). The fair value of the assets was
    $33 million ($32.8 million of real estate owned and
    $211,000 of other assets) and the fair value of liabilities was
    $23.0 million ($22.3 million of a mortgage payable,
    $506,000 of a derivative instrument, and $213,000 of other
    liabilities). During the year ended December 31, 2009, UDR
    recognized a gain on the remeasurement of our previously held
    equity interest in the joint venture, acquired assets and
    assumed liabilities to fair value of $315,000 and is included in
    “Gain on consolidation of joint ventures” on our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. In March 2010, the
    Company paid $5.2 million and acquired our partner’s
    49% interest in the joint venture. At the closing of the
    agreement, the Company’s interest in Bellevue was 98%. At
    December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the mortgage
    payable guaranteed by the Company was $22.3 million. The
    activities and accounts of Elements Too are included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial position as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 and consolidated results of
    operations and cash flows during year ended December 31,
    2010 and the

two-day

period ending December 31, 2009.

Prior to their consolidation in 2009, we evaluated our
    investments in these joint ventures when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that there may be an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. We considered various factors to determine if
    a decrease in value of each of these investments was

other-than-temporary.

In 2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of $16 million
    representing the

other-than-temporary

decline in fair values below the carrying values of two of the
    Company’s investments in Bellevue, Washington joint
    ventures.

During 2008, we completed the development of a consolidated
    joint venture located in Marina del Rey, California with 298
    apartment homes and a carrying value of $139.3 million. In
    December 2008, we acquired for $1.5 million our joint
    venture partner’s interest in their profit participation
    and terminated the property management agreement that had
    approximately two years remaining on the pre-existing contract.
    As a result of terminating our arrangement, the Company recorded
    a charge to earnings of $305,000 as the profit component related
    to the management agreement and capitalized the balance as part
    of the investment in real estate. The component capitalized as
    the investment in real estate is depreciated over the average
    remaining life of the tangible assets. As of December 31,
    2008, the Company included this property as a component of our
    wholly-owned communities.

Unconsolidated
    Joint Ventures

The Company recognizes earnings or losses from our investments
    in unconsolidated joint ventures consisting of our proportionate
    share of the net earnings or loss of the joint venture. In
    addition, we may earn fees for providing management services to
    the unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2010,
    UDR had investments in the following unconsolidated joint
    ventures which are accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting.

In November 2010, the Company acquired The Hanover
    Company’s (“Hanover”) partnership interests in
    the Hanover/MetLife Master Limited Partnership
    (the“UDR/MetLife Partnership”). The UDR/MetLife



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Partnership owns a portfolio of 26 operating communities
    containing 5,748 apartment homes and 11 land parcels with
    the potential to develop approximately 2,300 additional
    apartment homes. Under the terms of the UDR/MetLife Partnership,
    UDR will act as the general partner and earn fees for property
    and asset management and financing transactions.

UDR acquired ownership interests of 12.27% in the operating
    communities and 4.14% in the land parcels for
    $100.8 million. The initial investment of
    $100.8 million consists of $71.8 million in cash,
    which includes associated transaction costs, and a
    $30 million payable (includes discount of $1 million)
    to Hanover. UDR agreed to pay the $30 million balance to
    Hanover in two interest free installments in the amounts of
    $20 million and $10 million on the first and second
    anniversaries of the closing, respectively. The $30 million
    payable was recorded at its present value of $29 million
    using an effective interest rate of 2.67%. At December 31,
    2010, the net carrying value of the payable was
    $29.1 million, and interest expense of $129,000 was
    recorded during the year ended December 31, 2010. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company’s investment was
    $122.2 million.

UDR’s total cost of its equity investment of
    $100.8 million differed from the fair value of its
    proportionate share in the underlying net assets of the
    UDR/MetLife Partnership of $111.4 million. The difference
    of $10.6 million was attributable to certain assets and
    adjustments were allocated to UDR’s proportionate share in
    the UDR/MetLife Partnership’s buildings of
    $8.4 million, land of $3.9 million, and
    ($1.6 million) of lease intangible assets. With the
    exception of land, the difference related to buildings is
    amortized and recorded as a component of loss from
    unconsolidated entities over 45 years and the difference
    related to lease intangible assets is amortized and recorded as
    a component of loss from unconsolidated entities over
    11 months with the offset to the Company’s carrying
    value of its equity investment. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company recorded $264,000 of
    amortization.

In connection with the purchase of Hanover’s interests in
    the UDR/MetLife Partnership, UDR agreed to indemnify Hanover
    from liabilities from Hanover’s guaranty of
    $333 million (outstanding at December 31,
    2010) in loans which are secured by a security interest in
    the operating communities subject to the loan. The loans are to
    the

sub-tier

partnerships which own the 26 operating communities. The Company
    anticipates that the balance of these loans will be refinanced
    by the UDR/MetLife Partnership over the next twelve months.

In October 2010, the Company entered into a venture with an
    affiliate of Hanover to develop a 240-home community in
    Stoughton, Massachusetts. At closing and at December 31,
    2010, UDR owned a noncontrolling interest of 95% in the joint
    venture. Our initial investment was $10 million and our
    investment at December 31, 2010 was $10.3 million.

During 2009, UDR and an unaffiliated third party formed a joint
    venture for the investment of up to $450 million in
    multifamily properties located in key, high barrier to entry
    markets. The partners will contribute equity of
    $180 million of which the Company’s maximum equity
    will be 30% or $54 million when fully invested. During the
    year ended December 31, 2010, the joint venture acquired
    its first property (151 homes) located in Metropolitan
    Washington D.C. for $43.1 million. At closing and at
    December 31, 2010, the Company owned 30%. Our investment at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $5.2 million and
    $242,000, respectively.

In November 2007, UDR and an unaffiliated third party formed a
    joint venture which owns and operates 10 operating properties
    located in Texas (3,992 homes). UDR contributed cash and a
    property equal to 20% of the fair value of the properties. The
    unaffiliated member contributed cash equal to 80% of the fair
    value of the properties comprising the joint venture, which was
    then used to purchase the nine operating properties from UDR.
    Our initial investment was $20.4 million. Our investment at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $10.3 million and
    $13.9 million, respectively.

We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures
    when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may
    be an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. We consider various factors to determine

if a decrease in the value of the investment is

Prior to their consolidation and during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of
    $16 million representing the

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair values below the carrying values of two of
    the Company’s Bellevue, Washington joint ventures, which
    were previously accounted for under the equity method. The
    Company did not recognize any

    joint ventures during the years ended December 31, 2010 and

SECURED
    DEBT

Our secured debt instruments generally feature either monthly
    interest and principal or monthly interest-only payments with
    balloon payments due at maturity. For purposes of classification
    in the following table, variable rate debt with a derivative
    financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is deemed
    as fixed rate debt due to the Company having effectively
    established the interest rate for the underlying debt
    instrument. Secured debt, which encumbers $3.1 billion or

UDR entered into secured revolving credit facilities with Fannie
    Mae with an aggregate commitment of $1.4 billion at
    December 31, 2010. The Fannie Mae credit facilities are for
    an initial term of 10 years, bear interest at floating and
    fixed rates, and certain variable rate facilities can be
    extended for an additional five years at our option. We have
    $897.3 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted
    average interest rate of 5.3% and the remaining balance on these
    facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of
    1.7%. Further information related to these credit facilities is

    will record the secured debt at its estimated fair value and
    amortize any difference between the fair value and par to
    interest expense over the life of the underlying debt
    instrument. The unamortized fair market adjustment was a net

Our unsecured credit facility provides us with an aggregate
    borrowing capacity of $600 million, which at our election
    we can increase to $750 million under certain
    circumstances. Our unsecured credit facility with a consortium
    of financial institutions carries an interest rate equal to
    LIBOR plus a spread of 47.5 basis points (0.9% interest
    rate at December 31, 2010) and matures in July 2012.
    In addition, the unsecured credit facility contains a provision
    that allows us to bid up to 50% of the commitment and we can bid
    out the entire unsecured credit facility once per quarter so
    long as we maintain an investment grade rating.

Subject to the restrictions on ownership of our common stock and
    certain other conditions, at any time on or after July 15,
    2011 and prior to the close of business on the second business
    day prior to the maturity date of September 15, 2011, and
    also following the occurrence of certain events, holders of
    outstanding 3.625% notes may convert their notes into cash
    and, if applicable, shares of our common stock, at the
    conversion rate in effect at such time. Upon conversion of the
    notes, UDR will deliver cash and common stock, if any, based on
    a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for
    each trading day of the relevant 30 trading day observation
    period. The initial conversion rate for each $1,000 principal
    amount of notes was 26.6326 shares of our common stock
    (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately
    $37.55 per share), subject to adjustment under certain
    circumstances. The Company’s Special Dividend paid in
    January 2009 met the criteria to adjust the conversion rate and
    resulted in an

    the conversion rate was adjusted to 38.7123 shares of our
    Common Stock for each $1,000 of principal (equivalent to a

During the year ended December 31, 2009, pursuant to a cash
    tender offer announced on August 4, 2009, the Company
    repurchased $37.5 million in aggregate principal amount of
    its 8.50% Debentures due September 15, 2024 for
    $41.2 million of cash. In connection with this repurchase,
    the Company recorded a premium and related transaction costs.
    The tender offer expired on September 3, 2009.

applies to all convertible debt instruments that have a
    “net settlement feature”, which means that such
    convertible debt instruments, by their terms, may be settled
    either wholly or partially in cash upon conversion. This
    guidance requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that
    may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion to
    separately account for the liability and equity components in a
    manner reflective of the issuers’ nonconvertible debt
    borrowing rate. The Company adopted provisions under Subtopic

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

UDR has an effective registration statement that allows the
    Company to sell an undetermined number of debt and equity
    securities as defined in the prospectus. The Company has the
    ability to issue 250,000,000 shares of common stock and
    50,000,000 shares of preferred shares as of
    December 31, 2010.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    entered into the following equity transactions for our common
    stock:

•

Issued 6,144,367 shares of common stock in connection with
    an “at the market” equity distribution program where
    we received gross proceeds of approximately $110.8 million;

•

Issued 18,400,000 shares of common stock in connection with
    an underwritten public offering where we received gross proceeds
    of approximately $374.4 million;

•

Issued 553,097 shares of common stock in connection with
    stock options exercised;

•

Issued 1,009,440 shares of common stock through the
    Company’s 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
    “LTIP”), net of forfeitures; and

•

Distributions are subject to the approval of the Board of
    Directors and are dependent upon our strategy, financial
    condition and operating results. UDR common distributions for
    the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 totaled $0.73
    and $0.85 per share, respectively. For taxable years ending on
    or before December 31, 2010, the IRS is allowing REITS to
    distribute up to 90% of total distributions in common shares
    with the residual distributed in cash as a means of enhancing
    liquidity.

Preferred
    Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
    (“Series E”) has no stated par value and a
    liquidation preference of $16.61 per share. Subject to certain
    adjustments and conditions, each share of the Series E is
    convertible at any time and from time to time at the
    holder’s option into one share of our common stock prior to
    the Special Dividend (1.083 shares after the Special
    Dividend). The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote
    on an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with
    the holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders
    for the election of directors or for any other purpose on which
    the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The
    Series E has no stated maturity and is not subject to any
    sinking fund or any mandatory redemption.

Distributions declared on the Series E for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $1.33 per share. The
    Series E is not listed on any exchange. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, a total of
    2,803,812 shares of the Series E were outstanding.

UDR is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of the
    Series F Preferred Stock (“Series F”). The
    Series F may be purchased by holders of UDR’s
    operating partnership units, or OP Units, at a purchase
    price of $0.0001 per share. OP Unitholders are entitled to
    subscribe for and purchase one share of UDR’s Series F
    for each OP Unit held. A total of 3,208,706 and
    2,959,428 shares of the Series F were outstanding at a
    value of $321 and $296 at December 31, 2010 and 2009,

    vote for each share of the Series F they hold, voting
    together with the holders of our common stock, on each matter
    submitted to a vote of security holders at a meeting of our
    stockholders. The Series F does not entitle its holders to

    Series G may be redeemed for cash at our option, in whole
    or in part, at a redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued

    997,738 shares of Series G, respectively, for less
    than the liquidation preference of $25 per share resulting in a
    $25,000 and $2.6 million benefit to our net income/(loss)
    attributable to common stockholders, respectively.

Distribution
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

UDR’s Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
    (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows common and
    preferred stockholders the opportunity to purchase, through the
    reinvestment of cash dividends, additional shares of UDR’s
    common stock. From inception through December 31, 2008,
    shareholders have elected to utilize the Stock Purchase Plan to
    reinvest their distribution for the equivalent of
    9,957,233 shares of Company common stock. Shares in the
    amount of 13,134,256 were reserved for issuance under the Stock
    Purchase Plan as of December 31, 2010. During the year
    ended December 31, 2010, UDR acquired all shares issued
    through the open market.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

In May 2001, the stockholders of UDR approved the long term
    incentive plan (“LTIP”), which supersedes the 1985
    Stock Option Plan. The LTIP authorizes the granting of awards
    which may take the form of options to purchase shares of common
    stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, dividend
    equivalents, other stock-based awards, and any other right or
    interest relating to common stock or cash incentive awards to
    Company directors, employees and outside trustees to promote the
    success of the Company by linking individual’s compensation
    via grants of share based payment. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the stockholders of UDR voted to amend
    and restate the LTIP to increase the number of shares reserved
    from 4,000,000 shares to 16,000,000 shares on an
    unadjusted basis for issuance upon the grant or exercise of
    awards under the LTIP, which all can be for incentive stock
    option grants. The LTIP generally provides, among other things,
    that options are granted at exercise prices not lower than the
    market value of the shares on the date of grant and that options
    granted must be exercised within 10 years. As of
    December 31, 2010, there were 9,019,122 common shares
    available for issuance under the LTIP.

The LTIP contains change of control provisions allowing for the
    immediate vesting of an award upon certain events such as a
    merger where UDR is not the surviving entity. Upon the death or
    disability of an award recipient all outstanding instruments
    will vest and all restrictions will lapse. Further, upon the
    retirement of an award recipient, all outstanding instruments
    will vest and all restrictions will lapse. The LTIP specifies
    that in the event of a capital transaction, which includes but
    is not limited to stock dividends, stock splits, extraordinary
    cash dividends and spin-offs, the number of shares available for
    grant in totality or to a single individual is to be adjusted
    proportionately. The LTIP specifies that when a capital
    transaction occurs that would dilute the holder of the stock
    award, prior grants are to be adjusted such that the recipient
    is no worse as a result of the capital transaction.

UDR has granted stock options to our employees, subject to

Total remaining compensation cost related to unvested share
    options as of December 31, 2010 was approximately
    $1.4 million.

The weighted average remaining contractual life on all options
    outstanding as of December 31, 2010 is 13.9 years.
    3,287,639 of share options had exercise prices between $10.06
    and $10.30; 53,004 of share options had exercise prices between
    $13.15 and $13.74; 496,534 of share options had exercise prices
    between $24.38 and $25.10.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 we
    recognized $1.3 million, $1.3 million, and $372,000 of
    net compensation expense related to outstanding stock options.

Restricted
    Stock Awards

Restricted stock is granted to Company employees, officers,
    consultants, and directors. The restricted stock is valued on
    the grant date based upon the market price of UDR common stock
    on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recorded over the
    vesting period, which is generally three to four years.
    Restricted stock earn dividends payable in cash until the
    earlier of the date of the underlying restricted stock is
    exercised or the expiration of the underlying restricted stock
    award. Some of the restricted stock is performance based and is
    adjusted based on the Company’s performance. For the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized
    $12.2 million, $7.6 million, and $7.0 million of
    compensation expense related to the amortization of restricted
    stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, the Company
    had issued 2,750,363 shares of restricted stock under the
    LTIP. The total remaining compensation cost on unvested
    restricted stock awards was $14.0 million and has a
    weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.0 years as
    of December 31, 2010.

Profit
    Sharing Plan

Our profit sharing plan (the “Plan”) is a defined
    contribution plan covering all eligible full-time employees.
    Under the Plan, UDR makes discretionary profit sharing and
    matching contributions to the Plan as determined by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Aggregate
    provisions for contributions, both matching and discretionary,
    which are included in UDR’s Consolidated Statements of
    Operations for the three years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009, and 2008 were $0.7 million, $0.7 million, and

INCOME
    TAXES

For 2010, 2009, and 2008, UDR believes that we have complied
    with the REIT requirements specified in the Code. As such the
    REIT would generally not be subject to federal income taxes.

For income tax purposes, distributions paid to common
    stockholders may consist of ordinary income, qualified
    dividends, capital gains, unrecaptured section 1250 gains,
    return of capital, or a combination thereof. Distributions that
    exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits
    constitute a return of capital rather than taxable income and
    reduce the stockholder’s basis in their common shares. To
    the extent that a distribution exceeds both current and
    accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder’s
    basis in the common shares, it generally will be treated as a
    gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder’s common
    shares. For the three years ended December 31, 2010,

As of December 31, 2010, the Company through our TRS had
    federal net loss carryovers (“NOL”) of approximately
    $81.4 million. Of the total NOL, $20.5 million will be
    expiring in 2028, $30.0 million expiring in 2029 and the
    remaining $30.9 million expiring in 2030. As of
    December 31, 2010, the TRS had state NOL of approximately
    $92.0 million, of which approximately $1.8 million
    begins to expire in 2012 with the remainder expiring in 2020
    through 2030. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a
    valuation allowance of $55.5 million against 100% of its
    deferred tax assets and 78% of its federal net operating losses.
    During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company had a
    net change of $21.9 million in the valuation allowance.

FASB ASC 740,

Income Taxes

(“Topic 740”)
    (formerly FASB Interpretation 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes-An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109”) defines a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. Topic 740 requires the financial statements
    reflect expected future tax consequences of income tax positions
    presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the tax
    position and all relevant facts, but without considering time
    values. Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim
    periods, disclosure and transition.

The Company evaluates our tax position using a two-step process.
    First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than
    not (greater than 50 percent probability) to be sustained
    upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or
    litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the
    position. Then the Company will determine the amount of benefit
    to recognize and record the amount of the benefit that is more
    likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. When
    applicable, UDR recognizes interest

and/or

penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax
    expense. As of December 31, 2008, we reduced our recognized
    tax benefits as a result of a change in measurement of certain
    items. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, UDR does not
    believe we have any unrecognized tax benefits.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties is
    as follows (

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
    recognized would affect the effective rate is $0. We do not
    currently believe the unrecognized tax benefits will change
    significantly within the next 12 months.

We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for
    income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the
    Company recognized $0 in interest and penalties. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, UDR had $0 of interest and
    penalties accrued, respectively.

The Company files income tax returns in federal and various
    state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no
    longer subject to federal, state and local income tax
    examination by tax authorities for years prior to 2007.

NONCONTROLLING
    INTERESTS

Redeemable
    noncontrolling interests in operating partnerships

Interests in operating partnerships held by limited partners are
    represented by operating partnership units
    (“OP Units”). The income is allocated to holders
    of OP Units based upon net income attributable to common
    stockholders and the weighted average number of OP Units
    outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units
    outstanding during the period. Capital contributions,
    distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to
    non-controlling interests in accordance with the terms of the
    individual partnership agreements.

Limited partners have the right to require the Operating
    Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held
    by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the
    form of the Cash Amount [as defined in the limited partnership
    agreement of the Operating Partnership (the “Partnership
    Agreement”)], provided that such OP Units have been
    outstanding for at least one year. UDR, as the general partner
    of the Operating Partnership may, in its sole discretion,
    purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner
    either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one
    share of common stock of the Company for each OP Unit), as
    defined in the Partnership Agreement. Accordingly, the Company
    records the OP Units outside of permanent equity and
    reports the OP Units at their redemption value using the
    Company’s stock price at each balance sheet date.

The following table sets forth redeemable noncontrolling

FAIR
    VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell
    an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    at the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy
    prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure
    fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad
    levels, which are described below:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability
    to access.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than prices
    included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar
    assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
    identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are
    not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
    corroborated with observable market data.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain
    pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar
    techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

Amortized cost is presented for corporate debt securities.

Proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities during
    the year ended December 31, 2010 were $39.5 million,
    resulting in gross realized gains of $4.7 million. These
    gains are included in “Other income” in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the
    market standard methodology of netting the discounted future
    fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected
    variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments
    (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest
    rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest
    rate curves. The fair values of interest rate options are
    determined using the market standard methodology of discounting
    the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable
    interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The
    variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected
    receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future
    interest rates derived from observable market interest rate
    curves and volatilities.

The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to
    appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the
    respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair
    value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its
    derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the
    Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable
    credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds,
    mutual puts, and guarantees.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the
    inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of
    the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments
    associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs,
    such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the
    likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However,
    as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company has assessed
    the significance of the impact of the credit valuation
    adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions
    and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not
    significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a
    result, the Company has determined that its derivative
    valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of
    the fair value hierarchy.

We estimate the fair value of our Convertible Senior Unsecured
    Notes based on Level 1 inputs which utilize quoted prices
    in active markets where we have the ability to access value for
    identical liabilities.

Redeemable non-controlling interests in the Operating
    Partnership have a redemption feature and are marked to its
    redemption value. The redemption value is based on the fair
    value of the Company’s Common Stock at the redemption date,
    and therefore, is calculated based on the fair value of the
    Company’s Common Stock at the balance sheet date. Since the
    valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices
    for similar instruments in active markets, redeemable
    non-controlling interests in the Operating Partnership are
    classified as Level 2.

Financial
    Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

At December 31, 2010, the fair values of cash and cash
    equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable, accounts
    receivable, prepaids, real estate taxes payable, accrued
    interest payable, security deposits and prepaid rent,
    distributions payable and accounts payable approximated their
    carrying values because of the short term nature of these
    instruments. The estimated fair values of other financial
    instruments were determined by the Company using available
    market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
    Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and
    develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the estimates
    presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts
    the Company would realize on the disposition of the financial
    instruments. The use of different market assumptions or
    estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
    estimated fair value amounts.

We estimate the fair value of our debt instruments by
    discounting the remaining cash flows of the debt instrument at a
    discount rate equal to the replacement market credit spread plus
    the corresponding treasury yields. Factors considered in
    determining a replacement market credit spread include general
    market conditions, borrower specific credit spreads, time
    remaining to maturity,

loan-to-value

ratios and collateral quality (Level 3).

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
    operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
    assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
    estimated to be generated by the future operation and
    disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of
    those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical
    results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market
    and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The
    net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value. Our
    estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based upon
    Level 3 inputs such as industry trends and reference to
    market rates and transactions.

We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the
    value of the investment is

other-than-temporary.

These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the
    venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the
    entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the
    entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture
    partners and its lenders. Based on the significance of the
    unobservable inputs, we classify these fair value measurements
    within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In 2009, we
    recognized a non-cash charge of $16 million representing
    the

other-than-temporary

decline in fair values below the carrying values of two of our
    unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company did not recognize any

other-than-temporary

decrease in the value of its other investments in unconsolidated
    joint ventures during the years ended December 31, 2010 and
    2009.

After determining an

other-than-temporary

decrease in the value of an equity method investment has
    occurred, we estimate the fair value of our investment by
    estimating the proceeds we would receive upon a hypothetical
    liquidation of the investment at the date of measurement. Inputs
    reflect management’s best estimate of what market
    participants would use in pricing the investment giving
    consideration to the terms of the joint venture agreement and
    the estimated discounted future cash flows to be generated from
    the underlying joint venture asset. The inputs and assumptions
    utilized to estimate the future cash flows of the underlying
    asset are based upon the Company’s evaluation of the
    economy, market trends, operating results, and other factors,
    including judgments regarding costs to complete any construction
    activities, lease up and occupancy rates, rental rates,
    inflation rates, capitalization rates utilized to estimate the
    projected cash flows at the disposition, and discount rates.

DERIVATIVES
    AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

Risk
    Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its
    business operations and economic conditions. The Company
    principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business
    and operational risks through management of its core business
    activities. The Company manages economic risks, including
    interest



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the
    amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of
    derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company may
    enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures
    that arise from business activities that result in the receipt
    or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value
    of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s
    derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences
    in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known
    or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash
    payments principally related to the Company’s investments
    and borrowings.

Cash Flow
    Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives
    are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its
    exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this
    objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and
    caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
    Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the
    receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange
    for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the
    agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
    Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the
    receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest
    rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for
    an up front premium.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
    derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is
    recorded in “Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income/(Loss)” and is subsequently reclassified into
    earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash
    flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The
    ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the
    derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded less
    than a $1,000 loss of ineffectiveness in earnings attributable
    to reset date and index mismatches between the derivative and
    the hedged item, and the fair value of interest rate swaps that
    were not zero at inception of the hedging relationship.

Amounts reported in “Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income/(Loss)” related to derivatives will be reclassified
    to interest expense as interest payments are made on the
    Company’s variable-rate debt. Through December 31,
    2011, the Company estimates that an additional $6.7 million
    will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had the following
    outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as
    cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (

Credit-risk-related
    Contingent Features

The Company has agreements with some of its derivative
    counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if the
    Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default
    where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by
    the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default
    on its derivative obligations; or (2) the Company could be
    declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment
    of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due
    to the Company’s default on the indebtedness.

Certain of the Company’s agreements with its derivative
    counterparties contain provisions where if there is a change in
    the Company’s financial condition that materially changes
    the Company’s creditworthiness in an adverse manner, the
    Company may be required to fully collateralize its obligations
    under the derivative instrument.

The Company also has an agreement with a derivative counterparty
    that incorporates the loan and financial covenant provisions of
    the Company’s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the
    derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with these covenant
    provisions would result in the Company being in default on any
    derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement.

As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of derivatives in a
    net liability position, which includes accrued interest but
    excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to
    these agreements was $7.1 million. As of December 31,
    2010, the Company has not posted any collateral related to these
    agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions
    at December 31, 2010, it would have been required to settle
    its obligations under the agreements at their termination value
    of $7.1 million.

REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

FASB ASC Topic 280,

Segment Reporting

(formerly
    SFAS 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
    and Related Information”) (“Topic 280”), requires
    that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the
    chief operating decision maker to decide how to allocate
    resources and for purposes of assessing such segments’
    performance. UDR’s chief operating decision maker is
    comprised of several members of its executive management team
    who use several generally accepted industry financial measures
    to assess the performance of the business for our reportable
    operating segments.

UDR owns and operates multifamily apartment communities
    throughout the United States that generate rental and other
    property related income through the leasing of apartment homes
    to a diverse base of tenants. The primary financial measures for
    UDR’s apartment communities are rental income and net
    operating income (“NOI”). Rental income represents
    gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss
    and bad debt. NOI is defined as total revenues less direct
    property operating expenses. UDR’s chief operating decision
    maker utilizes NOI as the key measure of segment profit or loss.

UDR’s two reportable segments are same communities and
    non-mature/other communities:

•

Same store communities

represent those communities
    acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to January 1,
    2009, and held as of December 31, 2010. A comparison of
    operating results from the prior year is meaningful as these
    communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and
    operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there
    is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and
    the community is not held for disposition within the current
    year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy
    once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive
    months.

•

Non-mature/other communities

represent those communities
    that were acquired or developed in 2008, 2009 or 2010, sold
    properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as
    real estate held for disposition, condominium conversion
    properties, joint venture properties, properties managed by
    third parties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use
    properties.

Management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment
    communities on a same community and non-mature/other basis, as
    well as individually and geographically. This is consistent with
    the aggregation criteria of Topic 280 as each of our apartment
    communities generally has similar economic characteristics,
    facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore, the Company’s
    reportable segments have been aggregated by geography in a
    manner identical to that which is provided to the chief
    operating decision maker.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
    Partners

United Dominion Realty, L.P.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the “Partnership”) as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, partners’ capital and
    comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also
    included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
    responsibility of the Partnership’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
    audit of the Partnership’s internal control over financial
    reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
    over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
    procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
    for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
    the Partnership’s internal control over financial
    reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
    also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
    the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of the Partnership at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly, in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

No. 2010-06,

“Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements”
    an amendment to ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures.” This amendment provides for more robust
    disclosures about (1) the different classes of assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value, (2) the valuation
    techniques and inputs used, (3) the activity in
    Level 3 fair value measurements, and (4) the transfers
    between Levels 1, 2, and 3. ASU

No. 2010-06

was effective for the Operating Partnership for our fiscal year
    beginning in January 1, 2010.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-29,

which addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation
    of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements
    for business combinations. The amendments in ASU

2010-29

specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial
    statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of
    the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that
    occurred during the current year had occurred as of the
    beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
    The amendments in ASU

2010-29

also
    expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a
    description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring
    pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business
    combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and
    earnings. The amendments in ASU

2010-29

are
    effective prospectively for business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2010.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
    disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the
    financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid
    could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to
    conform to the current financial statement presentation.

Discontinued
    operations

For properties accounted for under FASB ASC 360,

Property, Plant and Equipment

(formerly

SFAS

144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets”) (“Topic 360”), the results of
    operations for those properties sold during the year or
    classified as

held-for-sale

at the end of the current year are classified as discontinued
    operations in the current and prior periods. Further, to meet
    the discontinued operations criteria, the Operating Partnership
    or related parties will not have any significant continuing
    involvement in the ownership or operation of the property after
    the sale or disposition. Once a property is deemed as

held-for-sale,

depreciation is no longer recorded. However, if the Operating
    Partnership determines that the property no longer meets the
    criteria for

held-for-sale,

the Company will recapture any unrecorded depreciation on the
    property (see Note 4,

Discontinued Operations

for
    further discussion).

Real
    estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical
    cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements, furniture,
    fixtures and equipment and other costs incurred during their
    development, acquisition and redevelopment.



UNITED
    DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are
    charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements,
    renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition

and/or

improvement of real estate assets are capitalized and
    depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the
    expenditures qualify as a betterment or the life of the related
    asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life
    expectancy.

The Operating Partnership purchases real estate investment
    properties and allocates the purchase price to the tangible and
    identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated
    fair value. The primary, although not only, identifiable
    intangible asset associated with our portfolio is the value of
    existing lease agreements. When allocating cost to an acquired
    community, we first allocate costs to the estimated intangible
    value of the existing lease agreements and then to the estimated
    value of the land, building and fixtures assuming the community
    is vacant. The Operating Partnership estimates the intangible
    value of the lease agreements by determining the lost revenue
    associated with a hypothetical

lease-up.

Depreciation on the building is based on the expected useful
    life of the asset and the in-place leases are amortized over
    their remaining contractual life. Property acquisition costs are
    expense as incurred.

Quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant, UDR, L.P.
    will assess our real estate portfolio for indicators of
    impairment. In determining whether the Operating Partnership has
    indicators of impairment in our real estate assets, we assess
    whether the long-lived asset’s carrying value exceeds the
    community’s undiscounted future cash flows, which is
    representative of projected NOI plus the residual value of the
    community. Our future cash flow estimates are based upon
    historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of
    future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding
    periods. If such indicators of impairment are present and the
    carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the
    community, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess
    of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair
    value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best
    estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to
    rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates and
    capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market
    rates and transactions.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are
    recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost
    to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition generally
    represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted
    for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next
    twelve months. Real estate held for disposition is carried at
    the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair
    value, less the cost to dispose, determined on an

asset-by-asset

basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on
    held for disposition properties are charged to expense as
    incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and
    replacements related to held for disposition properties are
    capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate
    held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets which are
    35 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major
    improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures,
    equipment, and other assets. As of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the value of our net intangible assets which are reflected
    in “Other assets” was $4.1 million and
    $4.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the value of our net intangible liabilities which are
    reflected in “Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other
    liabilities” was $3.3 million and $3.6 million in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balances are being
    amortized over the remaining life of the respective intangible.

All development and redevelopment projects and related carrying
    costs are capitalized during periods in which activities
    necessary to get the property ready for its intended use are in
    progress. As each building in a project is completed and becomes
    available for

lease-up,

the Operating Partnership ceases capitalization and the assets
    are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The costs of
    projects which include interest, real estate taxes, insurance,
    and allocated development overhead related to support costs for
    personnel working directly on the development site are
    capitalized during the construction period. During 2010, 2009,
    and 2008, total interest capitalized pertaining to redevelopment
    projects and land held for future development was
    $1.3 million, $444,000, and $580,000, respectively.



UNITED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash,
    cash equivalents and restricted cash

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and demand
    deposits with financial institutions. Restricted cash consists
    of escrow deposits held by lenders for real estate taxes,
    insurance and replacement reserves, and security deposits.

Derivative
    financial instruments

The General Partner utilizes derivative financial instruments to
    manage interest rate risk and will generally designate these
    financial instruments as cash flow hedges. Derivative financial
    instruments associated with the Operating Partnership’s
    allocation of the General Partner’s debt are recorded on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability
    and measured quarterly at their fair value. The changes in fair
    value for the General Partner’s cash flow hedges allocated
    to the Operating Partnership that are deemed effective are
    reflected in other comprehensive income and for non-designated
    derivative financial instruments in earnings. The ineffective
    component of cash flow hedges, if any, is recorded in earnings.

Comprehensive
    income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in capital
    during each period except for those resulting from investments
    by or distributions to partners, is displayed in the
    accompanying Consolidated Statements of Partners’ Capital
    and Comprehensive Income/(Loss). For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, other comprehensive income/(loss)
    consisted of the change in the fair value of the General
    Partner’s effective cash flow hedges that are allocated to
    the Operating Partnership.

Income
    taxes

The taxable income or loss of the Operating Partnership is
    reported on the tax returns of the partners. Accordingly, no
    provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements
    for federal or state income taxes on income that is passed
    through to the partners. However, any state or local revenue,
    excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating
    activities of the Operating Partnership are recorded at the
    entity level. The Operating Partnership’s tax returns are
    subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities.
    Net income for financial reporting purposes differs from the net
    income for income tax reporting purposes primarily due to
    temporary differences, principally real estate depreciation and
    the tax deferral of certain gains on property sales. The
    differences in depreciation result from differences in the book
    and tax basis of certain real estate assets and the differences
    in the methods of depreciation and lives of the real estate
    assets.

The Operating Partnership adopted certain accounting guidance
    within ASC Topic 740,

Income Taxes

, with respect to how
    uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured,
    presented, and disclosed in the financial statements. The
    guidance requires the accounting and disclosure of tax positions
    taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the
    Operating Partnership’s tax returns to determine whether
    the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being
    sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not
    deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
    recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year.
    Management of the Operating Partnership is required to analyze
    all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations,
    for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain
    states. The Operating Partnership has no examinations in
    progress and none are expected at this time.

Management of the Operating Partnership has reviewed all open
    tax years (2005- 2009) and major jurisdictions and
    concluded the adoption of the new accounting guidance resulted
    in no impact to the Operating Partnership’s financial
    position or results of operations. There is no tax liability
    resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain
    income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in future tax
    returns.

Revenue
    and real estate sales gain recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual
    basis when due from residents in accordance with FASB
    ASC 840,

Leases

(formerly SFAS 13
    “Accounting for Leases”) and SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition”.
    Rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis and
    recognized when earned. The Operating Partnership recognizes
    interest income, management and other fees and incentives when
    earned, fixed and determinable.

The Operating Partnership accounts for sales of real estate in
    accordance with FASB

ASC 360-20,

Real Estate Sales

(formerly SFAS 66,
    “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”). For sale
    transactions meeting the requirements for full accrual profit
    recognition, such as the Operating Partnership no longer having
    continuing involvement in the property, we remove the related
    assets and liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and
    record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes.
    For sale transactions that do not meet the full accrual sale
    criteria due to our continuing involvement, we evaluate the
    nature of the continuing involvement and account for the
    transaction under an alternate method of accounting.

Sales to entities in which we or our General Partner retain or
    otherwise own an interest are accounted for as partial sales. If
    all other requirements for recognizing profit under the full
    accrual method have been satisfied and no other forms of
    continuing involvement are present, we recognize profit
    proportionate to the outside interest in the buyer and will
    defer the gain on the interest we or our General Partner retain.
    The Operating Partnership will recognize any deferred gain when
    the property is then sold to a third party. In transactions
    accounted by us as partial sales, we determine if the buyer of
    the majority equity interest in the venture was provided a
    preference as to cash flows in either an operating or a capital
    waterfall. If a cash flow preference has been provided, we
    recognize profit only to the extent that proceeds from the sale
    of the majority equity interest exceed costs related to the
    entire property.

Earnings
    per Operating Partnership Unit

Basic earnings per OP Unit is computed by dividing net
    (loss)/income attributable to general and limited partner
    unitholders by the weighted average number of general and
    limited partner units (including redeemable OP Units)
    outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per OP Unit
    reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities
    or other contracts to issue OP Units were exercised or
    converted into OP Units or resulted in the issuance of
    OP Units and then shared in the earnings of the Operating
    Partnership. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009,
    and 2008, there were no dilutive instruments, and therefore,
    diluted earnings per OP Unit and basic earnings per
    OP Unit are the same. See Note 9,

Capital
    Structure

, for further discussion on redemption rights of
    OP Units.

Non-controlling
    interests

The noncontrolling interests represent the General
    Partner’s interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries
    and are presented in the capital section of the consolidated
    balance sheets since these interests are not convertible or
    redeemable into any other ownership interests of the Operating
    Partnership.

Advertising
    costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item
    “Administrative and marketing”. During 2010, 2009, and
    2008, total advertising expense from continuing and discontinued
    operations was $2.3 million, $2.4 million, and
    $2.6 million, respectively.

Allocation
    of General and Administrative Expenses

The Operating Partnership is charged directly with general and
    administrative expenses it incurs. The Operating Partnership is
    also charged with other general and administrative expenses that
    have been allocated



UNITED

by the General Partner to each of its subsidiaries, including
    the Operating Partnership, based on each subsidiary’s
    pro-rata portion of UDR’s total apartment homes. (See
    Note 6,

Related Party Transactions

.)

Market
    concentration risk

Approximately 20.6%, 14.4% and 10.6% of our apartment
    communities are located in Orange County, California;
    Metropolitan Washington DC; and San Francisco, California,
    respectively, based on the carrying value of our real estate
    portfolio as of December 31, 2010. Therefore, the
    Partnership is subject to increased exposure (positive or
    negative) from economic and other competitive factors specific
    to those markets.

REAL
    ESTATE OWNED

Real estate assets owned by the Operating Partnership consists
    of income producing operating properties and land held for

    Partnership owned and consolidated 81 communities in
    8 states plus the District of Columbia totaling 23,351
    apartment homes. The following table summarizes the carrying

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

The results of operations for properties sold during the year or
    designated as

held-for-sale

at the end of the year are classified as discontinued operations
    for all periods presented. Properties classified as real estate
    held for disposition generally represent properties that are
    actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing
    expected to occur within the next twelve months. The application
    of ASC Topic 360 does not have an impact on net income
    attributable to unit holders. The application of ASC Topic 360
    results in the reclassification of the operating results of all
    properties sold or classified as held for disposition through
    December 31, 2010, within the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and
    2008, and the reclassification of the assets and liabilities
    within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, if applicable.

For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Operating Partnership did not dispose of any communities. At
    December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership did not have
    any assets that met the criteria to be included in discontinued
    operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Operating
    Partnership sold 55 communities and recognized gains for
    financial reporting purposes of $475.2 million on these
    sales. In conjunction with the sale of these communities, the
    Operating Partnership received a $200 million note that was
    fully repaid in 2009.

    term of 10 years, bear interest at floating and fixed
    rates, and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for
    an additional five years at the General Partner’s option.
    At December 31, 2010, $897.3 million of the funded
    balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%
    and the remaining balance of $260.5 million on these

    fair value and par to interest expense over the life of the
    underlying debt instrument. The unamortized fair value
    adjustment of the fixed rate debt instruments on the Operating

Guarantor
    on Unsecured Debt

The Operating Partnership is a guarantor on the General
    Partner’s unsecured credit facility, with an aggregate
    borrowing capacity of $600 million, a $100 million
    term loan, and a $250 million term loan. At
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the
    outstanding balance under the unsecured credit facility was
    $31.8 million and $189.3 million, respectively.

On September 30, 2010, the Operating Partnership guaranteed
    certain outstanding debt securities of the General Partner.
    These guarantees provide that the Operating Partnership, as
    primary obligor and not merely as surety, irrevocably and
    unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the applicable
    securities and to the trustee and their successors and assigns
    under the respective indenture (a) the full and punctual
    payment when due, whether as stated maturity, by acceleration or
    otherwise, of all obligations of the General Partner under the
    respective indenture whether for principal or interest on the
    securities (and premium, if any), and all other monetary
    obligations of the General Partner under the respective
    indenture and the terms of the applicable securities and
    (b) the full and punctual performance within the applicable
    grace periods of all other obligations of the General Partner
    under the respective indenture and the terms of applicable
    securities. There was $96 million (net of a discount of
    $1.1 million) and $123 million (net of a discount of
    $3.4 million) outstanding of the General Partner’s
    3.625% Convertible Senior Notes at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively. There was $167.8 million and
    $165.8 million (net of a discount of $1.9 million)
    outstanding of the General Partner’s 4.00% Convertible
    Senior Notes at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Receivable
    due from the General Partner

The Operating Partnership participates in the General
    Partner’s central cash management program, wherein all the
    Operating Partnership’s cash receipts are remitted to the
    General Partner and all cash disbursements are funded by the
    General Partner. In addition, other miscellaneous costs such as
    administrative expenses are incurred by the General Partner on
    behalf of the Operating Partnership. As a result of these
    various transactions between the Operating Partnership and the
    General Partner, the Operating Partnership had a net receivable
    balance of $492.7 million and $588.2 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which is
    reflected as a reduction of capital on the consolidated balance
    sheets.

Allocation
    of General and Administrative Expenses

The General Partner performs various general and administrative
    and other overhead services, including property management, for
    the Operating Partnership including legal assistance,
    acquisitions analysis, marketing

and advertising, and allocates these expenses to the Operating
    Partnership first on the basis of direct usage when
    identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on its pro-rata
    portion of UDR’s apartment homes excluding units held in
    UDR’s taxable REIT subsidiary. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the general and
    administrative expenses and property management expenses,
    allocated to the Operating Partnership by UDR were
    $32.4 million and $25.9 million and
    $28.9 million, respectively, and are included in
    “General and Administrative” expenses and
    “Property management” expenses on the consolidated
    statements of operations. In the opinion of management, this
    method of allocation reflects the level of services received by
    the Operating Partnership from the General Partner.

Guaranty
    by the General Partner

The General Partner provided a “bottom dollar”
    guaranty to certain limited partners as part of their original
    contribution to the Operating Partnership. The guaranty protects
    the tax basis of the underlying contribution and is reflected on
    the OP unitholder’s

Schedule K-1

tax form. The guaranty was made in the form of a loan from the
    General Partner to the Operating Partnership at an annual
    interest rate of 0.593% and 5.83% at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. Interest payments are made monthly and the
    note is due December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the note payable due to the General Partner was
    $78.3 million and $71.5 million, respectively.

FAIR
    VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell
    an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    at the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy
    prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure
    fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad
    levels, which are described below:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability
    to access.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than prices
    included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar
    assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
    identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are
    not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
    corroborated with observable market data.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain
    pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar
    techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

Financial
    Instruments Carried at Fair Value

The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the
    market standard methodology of netting the discounted future
    fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected
    variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments
    (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest
    rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest
    rate curves. The fair values of interest rate options are
    determined using the market standard methodology of discounting
    the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable
    interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The
    variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected
    receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future
    interest rates derived from observable market interest rate
    curves and volatilities.

The Operating Partnership incorporates credit valuation
    adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance
    risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk
    in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of
    its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk,
    the Operating Partnership has considered the impact of netting
    and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral
    postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

Although the Operating Partnership has determined that the
    majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within
    Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation
    adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3
    inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate
    the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties.
    However, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Operating
    Partnership has assessed the significance of the impact of the
    credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its
    derivative positions and has determined that the credit
    valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall
    valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Operating
    Partnership has determined that its derivative valuations in
    their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value
    hierarchy.

Financial
    Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

At December 31, 2010, the fair values of cash and cash
    equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaids,
    real estate taxes payable, accrued interest payable, security
    deposits and prepaid rent, distributions payable and accounts
    payable approximated their carrying values because of the short
    term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair values of
    other financial instruments were determined by the Operating
    Partnership using available market information and appropriate
    valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to
    interpret market data and develop estimated fair values.
    Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily
    indicative of the amounts the Operating Partnership would
    realize on the disposition of the financial instruments. The use
    of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may
    have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The General Partner estimates the fair value of our debt
    instruments by discounting the remaining cash flows of the debt
    instrument at a discount rate equal to the replacement market
    credit spread plus the corresponding treasury yields. Factors
    considered in determining a replacement market credit spread
    include general market conditions, borrower specific credit
    spreads, time remaining to maturity,

loan-to-value

ratios and collateral quality (Level 3).



UNITED
    DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Operating Partnership records impairment losses on
    long-lived assets used in operations when events and
    circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the
    undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future
    operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net
    book value of those assets. Cash flow estimates are based upon
    historical results adjusted to reflect management’s best
    estimate of future market and operating conditions and our
    estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets
    is reduced to fair value. The General Partner’s estimates
    of fair value represent management’s estimates based upon
    Level 3 inputs such as rental rates, operating expenses,
    growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry
    trends, and references to market rates and transactions.

DERIVATIVES
    AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

Risk
    Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Operating Partnership is exposed to certain risk arising
    from both its business operations and economic conditions. The
    General Partner principally manages its exposures to a wide
    variety of business and operational risks through management of
    its core business activities. The General Partner manages
    economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit
    risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of
    its debt funding and through the use of derivative financial
    instruments. Specifically, the General Partner enters into
    derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise
    from business activities that result in the receipt or payment
    of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which
    are determined by interest rates. The General Partner’s and
    the Operating Partnership’s derivative financial
    instruments are used to manage differences in the amount,
    timing, and duration of the General Partner’s known or
    expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments
    principally related to the General Partner’s investments
    and borrowings.

Cash Flow
    Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The General Partner’s objectives in using interest rate
    derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to
    manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish
    this objective, the General Partner primarily uses interest rate
    swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management
    strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges
    involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty
    in exchange for the General Partner making fixed-rate payments
    over the life of the agreements without exchange of the
    underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as
    cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts
    from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate
    on the contract in exchange for an up front premium.

A portion of the General Partner’s interest rate
    derivatives have been allocated to the Operating Partnership
    based on the General Partner’s underlying debt instruments
    allocated to the Operating Partnership. (See Note 5,

Debt.

)

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
    derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is
    recorded in “Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income/(Loss)” and is subsequently reclassified into
    earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows
    associated with existing variable-rate debt. The ineffective
    portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is
    recognized directly in earnings. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership recorded less
    than $1,000 of ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to reset
    date and index mismatches between the derivative and the hedged
    item.

Amounts reported in “Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income/(Loss)” related to derivatives will be reclassified
    to interest expense as interest payments are made on the General
    Partner’s variable-rate debt that



UNITED
    DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

is allocated to the Operating Partnership. During the year ended
    December 31, 2011, we estimate that an additional
    $5.5 million will be reclassified as an increase to
    interest expense.

As of December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership had the

Credit-risk-related
    Contingent Features

The General Partner has agreements with some of its derivative
    counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if the
    General Partner defaults on any of its indebtedness, including
    default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been
    accelerated by the lender, then the General Partner could also
    be declared in default on its derivative obligations; or
    (2) the General Partner could be declared in default on its
    derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying
    indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the General
    Partner’s default on the indebtedness.

Certain of the General Partner ’s agreements with its
    derivative counterparties contain provisions where if there is a
    change in the General Partner’s financial condition that
    materially changes the General Partner ’s creditworthiness
    in an adverse manner, the General Partner may be required to
    fully collateralize its obligations under the derivative
    instrument.

The General Partner also has an agreement with a derivative
    counterparty that incorporates the loan and financial covenant
    provisions of the General Partner’s indebtedness with a
    lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to
    comply with these covenant provisions would result in the
    General Partner being in default on any derivative instrument
    obligations covered by the agreement.

As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of derivatives in a
    net liability position that were allocated to the Operating
    Partnership, which includes accrued interest but excludes any
    adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements
    was $5.5 million. As of December 31, 2010, the General
    Partner has not posted any collateral related to these
    agreements. If the General Partner had breached any of these
    provisions at December 31, 2010, it would have been
    required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their
    termination value of $5.5 million.

CAPITAL

General
    Partnership Units

The General Partner has complete discretion to manage and
    control the operations and business of the Operating
    Partnership, which includes but is not limited to the
    acquisition and disposition of real property, construction of
    buildings and making capital improvements, and the borrowing of
    funds from outside lenders or UDR and its subsidiaries to
    finance such activities. The General Partner can authorize,
    issue, sell, redeem or purchase any OP unit or securities of the
    Operating Partnership without the approval of the limited
    partners. The General Partner can also approve, with regard to
    the issuances of OP units, the class or one or more series of
    classes, with designations, preferences, participating, optional
    or other special rights, powers and duties including rights,
    powers and duties senior to limited partnership interests
    without approval of any limited partners. There were 110,883 OP
    units of general partnership interest at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, all of which were held by UDR.

Limited
    Partnership Units

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were 179,798,525 OP
    units outstanding of limited partnership interest, of which
    1,751,671 were Class A Limited Partnership OP units. UDR
    owned 174,736,557 or 97.2% and 173,811,933 or 96.7% at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The remaining
    5,061,968 or 2.8% and 5,986,592 or 3.3% OP units outstanding of
    limited partnership interest were held by non- affiliated
    partners at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of
    which 1,751,671 were Class A Limited Partnership units.

The limited partners have the right to require the Operating
    Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP units held by
    the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the
    form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the Operating Partnership
    Agreement), provided that such OP Units have been
    outstanding for at least one year. UDR, as general partner of
    the Operating Partnership may, in its sole discretion, purchase
    the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the
    Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of
    common stock of UDR for each OP Unit), as defined in the
    Operating Partnership Agreement. (Pursuant to the Fourth
    Amendment to the Operating Partnership Agreement, redemptions
    related to the Series A Out-Performance Partnership Shares
    [discussed below] were made on a one for 1.5091 during the
    period from December 27, 2007 to March 13, 2009.)

The non-affiliated limited partners’ capital is adjusted to
    redemption value at the end of each reporting period with the
    corresponding offset against the UDR limited partner capital
    account based on the redemption rights note above. The aggregate
    value upon redemption of the then-outstanding OP units held by
    limited partners was $119.1 million, $98.4 million,
    and $101.0 million as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and
    2008, respectively, based on the value of UDR’s common
    stock at each period end. Once each OP unit has been redeemed,
    the redeeming partner has no right to receive any distributions
    from the Operating Partnership on or after the date of
    redemption.

Class A
    Limited Partnership Units

Class A Partnership units have a cumulative annual,
    non-compounded preferred return, which is equal to 8% based on a
    value of $16.61 per Class A Limited Partnership Unit.

Holders of the Class A Limited Partnership units
    exclusively possess certain voting rights. The Operating
    Partnership may not perform the following without approval of
    the holders of the Class A Partnership units:
    (i) increase the authorized or issued amount of
    Class A Partnership Units, (ii) reclassify any other
    partnership interest into Class A Partnership Units,

    Partner and Limited Partners in accordance with their percentage
    interests. Losses and depreciation and amortization expenses,
    non-recourse liabilities are allocated to the General Partner
    and Limited Partners in accordance with their percentage
    interests. Losses allocated to the Limited Partners are capped
    to the extent that such an allocation would not cause a deficit
    in the Limited Partners capital account. Such losses are,
    therefore, allocated to the General Partner. If any
    Partner’s capital balance were to fall into a deficit any
    income and gains are allocated to each Partner sufficient to
    eliminate its negative capital balance.

Out-Performance
    Programs

Series A
    Out-Performance Program

In May 2001, the Board of Directors of UDR approved the
    Series A Out-Performance Program (the “Series A
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers and
    other key officers of UDR (the “Participants”) were
    given the opportunity to invest indirectly in UDR by purchasing
    interests in a limited liability company (the
    “Series A LLC”), the only asset of which is a
    special class of partnership units of the Operating Partnership
    (“Series A Out-Performance Partnership Shares” or
    “Series A OPPSs”), for an initial investment of
    $1.27 million (the full market value of the Series A
    OPPS, at inception, as determined by an independent investment
    banking firm). The Series A Program measured the cumulative
    total return on UDR’s common stock over a

28-month

period beginning February 2001 and ending May 31, 2003.

The Series A Program was designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock,
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period, exceeded the
    greater of (a) the cumulative total return of the Morgan
    Stanley REIT Index over the same period; and (b) is at
    least the equivalent of a 30% total return, or 12% annualized.

At the conclusion of the measurement period on May 31,
    2003, UDR’s total return satisfied these criteria. As a
    result, the Series A LLC as holder of the Series A
    OPPSs received distributions and allocations of income and loss
    from the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and
    allocations that were received on 1,853,204 OP Units, which
    distributions and allocations were distributed to the
    participants on a pro rata basis based on the ownership of the
    Series A LLC.

Series C
    Out-Performance Program

In May 2005, the stockholders of UDR approved a new
    Out-Performance Program and the first series of new
    Out-Performance Partnership Shares under the program are the
    Series C Out-Performance Units (the “Series C
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers and
    other key employees of UDR (the “Series C
    Participants”) were given the opportunity to invest
    indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests in UDR Out-Performance
    III, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
    “Series C LLC”), the only asset of which is a
    special class of partnership units of the Operating Partnership
    (“Series C Out-Performance Partnership Shares” or
    “Series C OPPSs”). The purchase price for the
    Series C OPPSs was determined by the Compensation Committee
    of UDR’s Board of Directors to be $750,000, assuming 100%
    participation, and was based upon the advice of an independent
    valuation expert. UDR’s performance for the Series C
    Program was measured over the

36-month

period from June 1, 2005 to May 30, 2008.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Series C Program was designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period is at least the
    equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized
    (“Minimum Return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if UDR’s
    cumulative total return satisfies these criteria, the
    Series C LLC as holder of the Series C OPPSs will
    receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series C
    Participants as holders of interests in the Series C
    LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from
    the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and
    allocations that would be received on the number of
    OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of UDR’s common stock over the measurement period
    exceeds the Minimum Return (such excess being the “Excess
    Return”);

ii. multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by UDR’s
    market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares
    outstanding over the

36-month

period, including common stock, common stock equivalents and
    OP Units); and

iii. dividing the number obtained in clause (ii) by
    the market value of one share of UDR’s common stock on the
    valuation date, computed as the volume-weighted average price
    per day of common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
    preceding the valuation date.

For the Series C OPPSs, the number determined pursuant to
    (ii) above is capped at 1% of market capitalization.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of
    UDR’s common stock does not meet the Minimum Return, then
    the Series C Participants will forfeit their entire initial
    investment.

At the conclusion of the measurement period, May 30, 2008,
    the total cumulative return on UDR’s common stock did not
    meet the minimum return threshold. As a result, there were no
    payouts under the Series C OPPSs program and the investment
    made by the holders of the Series C OPPSs was forfeited.

Series D
    Out-Performance Program

In February 2006, the Board of Directors of UDR approved the
    Series D Out-Performance Program (the “Series D
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers of
    UDR (the “Series D Participants”) were given the
    opportunity to invest indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests
    in UDR Out-Performance IV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
    company (the “Series D LLC”), the only asset of
    which is a special class of partnership units of the Operating
    Partnership (“Series D Out-Performance Partnership
    Shares” or “Series D OPPSs”). The
    Series D Program was part of the New Out-Performance
    Program approved by UDR’s stockholders in May 2005. The
    Series D LLC agreed to sell 830,000 membership units
    unadjusted for the Special Dividend to certain members of
    UDR’s senior management at a price of $1.00 per unit. The
    aggregate purchase price of $830,000 for the Series D
    OPPSs, assuming 100% participation, was based upon the advice of
    an independent valuation expert. The Series D Program
    measured the cumulative total return on our common stock over
    the

36-month

period beginning January 1, 2006 and ending
    December 31, 2008.

The Series D Program was designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period was at least
    the equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized
    (“Minimum Return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if UDR’s
    cumulative total return satisfied these criteria, the
    Series D LLC as holder of the Series D OPPSs would
    receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series D
    Participants as holders of interests in the Series D
    LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from

    allocations that would have been received on the number of
    OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of UDR’s common stock over the measurement period
    exceeds the Minimum Return (such excess being the “Excess
    Return”);

ii. multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by UDR’s
    market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares
    outstanding over the

    preceding the valuation date.

For the Series D OPPSs, the number determined pursuant to

At the conclusion of the measurement period, December 31,
    2008, the total cumulative return on UDR’s common stock did
    not meet the minimum return threshold. As a result, there were
    no payouts under the Series D OPPSs program and the
    investment made by the holders of the Series D OPPSs was
    forfeited.

Series E
    Out-Performance Program

In February 2007, the Board of Directors of UDR approved the
    Series E Out-Performance Program (the “Series E
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers of
    UDR (the “Series E Participants”) were given the
    opportunity to invest indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests
    in UDR Out-Performance V, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
    company (the “Series E LLC”), the only asset of
    which is a special class of partnership units of the Operating
    Partnership (“Series E Out-Performance Partnership
    Shares” or “Series E OPPSs”). The
    Series E Program was part of the New Out-Performance
    Program approved by UDR’s stockholders in May 2005. The
    Series E LLC agreed to sell 805,000 membership units to
    certain members of UDR’s senior management at a price of
    $1.00 per unit. The aggregate purchase price of $805,000 for the
    Series E OPPSs, assuming 100% participation, was based upon
    the advice of an independent valuation expert. The Series E
    Program measured the cumulative total return on our common stock
    over the

36-month

period beginning January 1, 2007 and ending
    December 31, 2009.

The Series E Program was designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period was at least

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Commitments

Ground
    Leases

The Operating Partnership owns four communities which are
    subject to ground leases expiring between 2019 and 2103. The
    leases are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 840,

Leases

(formerly SFAS 13). Future minimum lease
    payments as of December 31, 2010 are $4.5 million for
    each of the years ending December 31, 2011 to 2015, and a
    total of $294.4 million for years thereafter. For purposes
    of our ground lease contracts, the Operating Partnership uses
    the minimum lease payment, if stated in the agreement. For
    ground lease agreements where there is a reset provision based
    on the communities appraised value or consumer price index but
    does not included a specified minimum lease payment, the
    Operating Partnership uses the current rent over the remainder
    of the lease term.

The Operating Partnership incurred $4.7 million,
    $4.6 million, and $4.3 million of ground rent expense
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    respectively.

Contingencies

Litigation
    and Legal Matters

The Operating Partnership is subject to various legal
    proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of
    business. The Operating Partnership cannot determine the
    ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and
    claims at this time. The General Partner believes that such
    liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or
    otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Operating Partnership’s financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flow.

REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

FASB ASC Topic 280,

Segment Reporting

(formerly
    SFAS 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
    and Related Information”) (“Topic 280”), requires
    that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the
    chief operating decision maker to decide how to allocate
    resources and for purposes of assessing such segments’
    performance. The Operating Partnership has the same chief
    operating decision maker as that of its parent, the General
    Partner. The chief operating decision maker consists of several
    members of UDR’s executive management team who use several
    generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the
    performance of the business for our reportable operating
    segments.

The Operating Partnership owns and operates multifamily
    apartment communities throughout the United States that generate
    rental and other property related income through the leasing of
    apartment homes to a diverse base of tenants. The primary
    financial measures of the Operating Partnership’s apartment
    communities are rental income and net operating income
    (“NOI”), and are included in the chief operating
    decision maker’s assessment of UDR’s performance on a
    consolidated basis. Rental income represents gross market rent
    less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. NOI
    is defined as total revenues less direct property operating
    expenses. The chief operating decision maker utilizes NOI as the
    key measure of segment profit or loss.

The Operating Partnership’s two reportable segments are
    same communities and non-mature/other communities:

•

Same store communities

represent those communities
    acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to January 1,
    2009, and held as of December 31, 2010. A comparison of
    operating results from the prior year is meaningful as these
    communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and
    operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there
    is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and
    the community is not held for disposition within the current
    year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy
    once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive
    months.

•

Non-mature/other communities

represent those communities
    that were acquired or developed in 2008, 2009 or 2010, sold
    properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as
    real estate held for disposition, condominium conversion
    properties, joint venture properties, properties managed by
    third parties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use
    properties.

Management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment
    communities on a same community and non-mature/other basis, as
    well as individually and geographically. This is consistent with
    the aggregation criteria of Topic 280 as each of our apartment
    communities generally has similar economic characteristics,
    facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore, the Operating
    Partnership’s reportable segments have been aggregated by
    geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to the
    chief operating decision maker.

All revenues are from external customers and no single tenant or
    related group of tenants contributed 10% or more of the
    Operating Partnership’s total revenues during the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.
