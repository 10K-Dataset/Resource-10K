PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

UDR, Inc. is a self administered real estate investment trust,
    or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages
    apartment communities nationwide. At December 31, 2009, our
    consolidated apartment portfolio included 165 communities
    located in 23 markets, with a total of 45,913 completed
    apartment homes. In addition, we have an ownership interest in
    3,992 apartment homes through our unconsolidated joint ventures.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as
    the “Code”. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must
    continue to meet certain tests which, among other things,
    generally require that our assets consist primarily of real
    estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate
    assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable
    income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders
    annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject
    to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our
    net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our
    stockholders annually. In 2009, we declared total distributions
    of $0.845 per common share. Dividends paid in 2009 include a
    special dividend of $0.96 per common share that was declared in
    the fourth quarter of 2008 and paid to our common stockholders
    in the first quarter of 2009. Beginning with the dividend
    declared in the second quarter of 2009, we reduced the regularly
    declared quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.18 per
    share in order to increase our retained capital.

We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003,
    we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland.
    Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive,
    Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado. As of
    February 12, 2010, we had 1,280 full-time employees
    and 83 part-time employees.

Our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships, Heritage
    Communities L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and United
    Dominion Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and RE3,
    our subsidiary that focuses on development, land entitlement and
    short-term hold investments. Unless the context otherwise
    requires, all references in this Report to “we,”
    “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or
    “UDR” refer collectively to UDR, Inc. its
    subsidiaries, and its consolidated joint ventures.

Business
    Objectives

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic
    returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders
    with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve
    this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following
    goals and strategies:

•

own and operate apartments in markets that have the best growth
    prospects based on favorable job formation and low home
    affordability, thus enhancing stability and predictability of
    returns to our stockholders;

•

manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to
    buying, selling, renovating, and building apartment communities;

•

empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently
    and effectively;

•

measure and reward associates based on specific performance
    targets; and

•

manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of
    earnings and dividends.



    Accomplishments

•

Repaid $159.6 million of secured debt and
    $658.2 million of unsecured debt (represents the notional
    amount of debt repaid and excludes the gain on extinguishment).
    The $658.2 million of unsecured debt includes the
    prepayment of our $240 million term loan,
    $141.9 million for maturing medium-term notes and
    $276.3 million for the repurchase of unsecured debt. The
    unsecured debt repurchases includes the tender offer of
    $37.5 million in aggregate principle amount of our 8.50%,
    debentures due September 15, 2024 for $41.2 million of
    cash.

•

We repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $238.9 million for $222.3 million, which is included
    in the $658.2 million above, resulting in a gain on
    extinguishment of $9.8 million, net of deferred finance
    charges. The unsecured debt repurchased by the Company matured
    in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2024 and 2035.

•

We closed on a $200 million secured credit facility. At
    December 31, 2009, $106.9 million of the amount drawn
    under the facility matures October 2019 and carries a fixed rate
    of 5.38% and $88.9 million of the amount drawn under the
    facility matures December 2019 and carries a fixed interest rate
    of 5.16%. The Company has one year from September 11, 2009
    to draw on the remaining $4.2 million of capacity.

•

Initiated an “At the Market” equity distribution
    program pursuant to which we may sell up to 15 million
    shares of common stock from time to time to or through sales
    agents, by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the
    New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market prices at the time
    of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable agent. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company sold 4,460,032 shares
    of common stock under the program at an average price per share
    of $15.48, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
    $69.1 million. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales,
    after deducting commissions paid to the sales agents of
    approximately $1.4 million and related issuance costs of
    approximately $500,000, were approximately $67.2 million.

•

We established a joint venture with Kuwait Finance House for the
    investment of up to $450.0 million in multifamily
    properties located in key, high barrier to entry markets.

•

We acquired a newly constructed community with 289 units
    located in Dallas, Texas for approximately $28.5 million.

•

We completed development on three wholly-owned communities with
    831 apartment homes at a total cost of $119.5 million.

UDR’s
    Strategies and Vision

UDR previously announced its vision to be the innovative
    multifamily public real estate investment of choice. We
    identified the following strategies to guide decision-making and
    growth:

1. Strengthen our portfolio

2. Continually improve operations

3. Maintain access to low-cost capital

Strengthen
    our Portfolio

UDR is focused on increasing its presence in markets with
    favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability,
    and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing.
    Portfolio decisions consider third-party research, taking into
    account job growth, multifamily permitting and housing
    affordability.

In 2008, UDR sold a portfolio of properties in 86 communities
    for total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. This
    portfolio sale dramatically accelerated our transformation to
    focus on markets that have the best growth prospects based on
    favorable job formation and low single-family home
    affordability. At



December 31, 2009, approximately 56.8% of the
    Company’s same store net operating income was provided by
    our communities located in California, Metropolitan
    Washington, D.C., Oregon and Washington State.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

During 2009, in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our
    portfolio, UDR acquired a new constructed community with 289
    apartment homes for approximately $28.5 million. UDR
    targets apartment community acquisitions in markets where job
    growth expectations are favorable, single-family home
    affordability is low, and the demand/supply ratio for
    multi-family housing is favorable.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•

population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall
    potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
    environment of the community in which the property is located;

•

geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment,
    transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver
    significant economies of scale;

•

construction quality, condition and design of the community;

•

current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability
    to increase cash flow;

•

potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•

ability to increase the value and profitability of the property
    through upgrades and repositioning;

•

terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent
    increases;

•

occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar
    type in the vicinity;

•

prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing
    of the property; and

•

competition from existing multifamily communities and the
    potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in
    the area.

We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and
    performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding
    whether to dispose of a property include:

•

current market price for an asset compared to projected
    economics for that asset;

•

potential increases in new construction in the market area;

•

areas where the economy is not expected to grow
    substantially; and

•

markets where we do not intend to establish long-term
    concentration.

We did not have any dispositions of properties in 2009.

    acquisitions, apartment community dispositions, and our year-end

Redevelopment
    Activities

During 2009, we continued to reposition properties in targeted
    markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add
    value. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred
    $33.5 million in major renovations, which include major
    structural changes

and/or

architectural revisions to existing buildings.

Joint
    Venture Activities

The Company has an interest in a consolidated joint venture,
    which has the following project under development as of

On October 16, 2009, our partner in the joint venture,
    noted in the table above, resigned as managing member and
    appointed UDR as managing member. In addition, our partner
    relinquished its voting rights and approval rights and its
    ability to substantively participate in the decision-making
    process of the joint venture. As a result of UDR’s control
    of the joint venture, the Company is required to consolidate the
    joint venture. On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into an
    agreement with our partner to purchase its 49% interest in
    Elements Too for $3.2 million (outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). Upon the closing of the agreement, the
    Company’s equity interest in Elements Too will be 98%.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“989 Elements”) which owns and operates a
    23-story, 166 home high-rise apartment community in the central
    business district of Bellevue, Washington. At closing, UDR owned
    49% of the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $11.8 million. On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into
    an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49% interest in
    989 Elements for $7.8 million (outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). Concurrently, our partner resigned as
    managing member and appointed UDR as managing member. In
    addition, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture. At closing,
    the Company’s equity interest in 989 Elements will increase
    to 98%.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Bellevue Plaza”) which owns an operating
    retail site in Bellevue, Washington. The Company initially
    planned to develop a 430 home high rise



apartment building with ground floor retail on an existing
    operating retail center. However, during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the joint venture decided to continue to
    operate the retail property as opposed to developing a high rise
    apartment building on the site. On December 30, 2009, UDR
    entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49%
    interest in Bellevue Plaza for $5.2 million (outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). In addition, our partner resigned as
    managing member and appointed UDR as managing member. Concurrent
    with its resignation, our partner relinquished its voting rights
    and approval rights and its ability to substantively participate
    in the decision-making process of the joint venture. At closing,
    the Company’s equity interest in Bellevue Plaza will
    increase from 49% to 98%.

For additional information regarding these consolidated joint
    ventures, see Note 4 “Joint Ventures” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

During 2009, the Company established a joint venture with Kuwait
    Finance House for the investment of up to $450.0 million in
    multifamily properties located in key, high barrier to entry
    markets. The partners will contribute equity of
    $180.0 million of which the Company’s maximum equity
    contribution will be 30% or $54.0 million when fully
    invested. At closing, we owned 30% of the joint venture. Our
    investment at December 31, 2009 was $242,000. At
    December 31, 2009, the joint venture did not own any
    multi-family properties. The joint venture intends to be fully
    invested over a two year investment period, and the Company will
    receive asset and property management fees from the jont venture.

Continually
    Improve Operations

The Company continues to make progress on automating its
    business as a way to drive operating efficiencies and to better
    meet the changing needs of our residents. Since its launch in
    January 2009, UDR residents have been utilizing the resident
    internet portal on our website. UDR’s residents have access
    to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a
    week to pay rent on line and to submit service requests. As a
    result of transforming operations through technology our
    residents get the convenience they want and our operating teams
    have become more efficient. These improvements in adopting the
    web as a way to conduct business with the Company have also
    resulted in a decline in marketing and advertising costs and
    improved cash management.

During 2009, UDR continually enhanced

www.udr.com

and individual community websites through deploying an
    innovative customized room painter selection program, apartment
    floor selector application, and updating the websites source
    code to make the webpages load faster. In addition to
    improvements to UDR.com, we also added an augmented reality
    apartment search application, an iPhone apartment search
    application and soon to be released Android, BlackBerry and Palm
    Pre apartment search applications. These enhancements have
    increased overall web visitor traffic to over 1.9 million
    visitors and almost 1.2 million organic search engine
    visitors which contributed to a 78%

year-over-year

lead stream increase.

Maintaining
    Access to Low-Cost Capital

We seek to maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek,
    and not just react to, opportunities available in the
    marketplace. We have structured our borrowings to stagger our
    debt maturities and to be able to opportunistically access both
    secured and unsecured debt.

Special
    Dividend

On November 5, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend on a pre-adjusted basis of $1.29 per share (“the
    Special Dividend”). The Special Dividend was paid on
    January 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on
    December 9, 2008. The dividend represented the
    Company’s fourth quarter recurring distribution of $0.33
    per share and an additional special distribution of $0.96 per
    share due to taxable income arising from our dispositions
    occurring during the year. Subject to the Company’s right
    to pay the entire Special Dividend in cash, stockholders had the
    option to make an election to receive payment in cash or in
    shares, however, the aggregate amount of cash payable to
    stockholders, other than cash payable in lieu of fractional
    shares, would not be less than $44.0 million.



The Special Dividend, totaling $177.1 million, was paid on
    137,266,557 shares issued and outstanding on the record
    date. Approximately $133.1 million of the Special Dividend
    was paid through the issuance of 11,358,042 shares of
    common stock, which was determined based on the volume weighted
    average closing sales price of our common stock of $11.71 per
    share on the NYSE on January 21, 2009 and January 22,
    2009. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board’s (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
    Update

2010-01,

Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components
    of Stock and Cash

(“ASU

2010-01”),

which considers distributions that contain components of cash
    and stock and allows shareholders to select their preferred form
    of distribution as a stock dividend. Such a distribution is
    treated as a stock issuance on the date the dividend is paid. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company accrued $133.1 million
    of distribution payable related to the Special Dividend. ASU

2010-01

is
    effective for the Company on December 15, 2009 and should
    be applied on a retrospective basis. As a result, the Company
    reversed the effect of the issuance of additional shares of
    common stock pursuant to the Special Dividend, which was
    retroactively reflected in each of the historical periods
    presented within the Company’s

Form 8-K

filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the
    “SEC” on May 22, 2009, and effectively issued
    these shares on January 29, 2009 (the payment date of the
    Special Dividend).

Financing
    Activities

As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we
    utilized proceeds from debt and equity offerings and
    refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, and
    acquire apartment communities. The following is a summary of our
    major financing activities in 2009:

•

Repaid $159.6 million of secured debt and
    $658.2 million of unsecured debt (represents the notional
    amount of debt repaid and excludes the gain on extinguishment).
    The $658.2 million of unsecured debt includes the
    prepayment of our $240 million term loan,
    $141.9 million for maturing medium-term notes and
    $276.3 million for the repurchase of unsecured debt. The
    unsecured debt repurchases includes the tender offer of
    $37.5 million in aggregate principle amount of our
    8.50% debentures due September 15, 2024 for
    $41.2 million of cash.

•

Repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $238.9 million for $222.3 million, which is included
    in the $658.2 million above, resulting in a gain on
    extinguishment of $9.8 million, net of deferred finance
    charges. The unsecured debt repurchased by the Company matured
    in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2024 and 2035.

•

Closed on a $200 million secured credit facility. At
    December 31, 2009, $106.9 million of the amount drawn
    under the facility matures October 2019 and carries a fixed rate
    of 5.38% and $88.9 million of the amount drawn under the
    facility matures December 2019 and carries a fixed interest rate
    of 5.16%. The Company has one year from September 11, 2009
    to draw on the remaining $4.2 million of capacity.

•

Repurchased 997,738 shares of our 6.75% Series G
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $21.5 million,
    less than their liquidation value of $24.9 million.

•

Initiated an “At the Market” equity distribution
    program pursuant to which we may sell up to 15 million
    shares of common stock from time to time to or through sales
    agents, by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the
    New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market prices at the time
    of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable agent. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company sold 4,460,032 shares
    of common stock under the program at an average price per share
    of $15.48, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately
    $69.1 million. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales,
    after deducting commissions paid to the sales agents of
    approximately $1.4 million and related issuance costs of
    approximately $500,000, were approximately $67.2 million.

Markets
    and Competitive Conditions

At December 31, 2009, 56.8% of the Company’s same
    store net operating income was generated from apartment homes
    located in California, Metropolitan Washington D.C., Oregon, and
    Washington State. We



believe that this diversification increases investment
    opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical
    local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the
    stability and predictability of our earnings.

Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of
    our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our
    communities do not have. Competing communities can use
    concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive
    advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer
    than our communities. The competitive position of each community
    is different depending upon many factors including

sub-market

supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors
    compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop
    new properties. These competitors include insurance companies,
    pension and investment funds, public and private real estate
    companies, investment companies and other public and private
    apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or
    lower capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete
    effectively for residents and investments. We believe our
    competitive advantages include:

•

a fully integrated organization with property management,
    development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and
    financing expertise;

•

scalable operating and support systems, which include automated
    systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents
    and to effectively focus on our Internet marketing efforts;

•

purchasing power;

•

geographic diversification with a presence in 23 markets across
    the country; and

•

significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us
    to be a local operating expert.

Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease
    management, improved expense control, increased resident
    retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans
    tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of
    operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in
    targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform,
    should position us for continued operational improvement in
    spite of the difficult economic environment.

Communities

At December 31, 2009, our apartment portfolio included 165
    consolidated communities having a total of 45,913 completed
    apartment homes and an additional 1,415 under development. The
    overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and
    to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who
    are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses, such as
    water and sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. In
    addition, it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures
    per apartment home, and therefore should result in increased
    cash flow in the future.

Same
    Community Comparison

We believe that one pertinent qualitative measurement of the
    performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same
    store community’s net operating income (“NOI”),
    which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding
    property management and other operating expenses. Our same store
    population are operating communities which we own and have
    stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning
    of the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2009,
    our same store NOI decreased by $6.6 million or 2.2%
    compared to the prior year. The decrease in NOI for the 33,166
    apartment homes which make up the same store population was
    driven by a decrease in revenue rental rates which was partially
    offset by increased occupancy and a decrease in expenses.

Revenue growth in 2010 may be impacted by general adverse
    conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates,
    increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other
    factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.



Tax
    Matters

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To
    continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain
    tests that, among other things, generally require that our
    assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be
    derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we
    distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than
    net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we
    maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be
    subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level
    on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed
    to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as
    a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state
    and local taxes on our income and property.

We may utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries to engage in activities
    that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the
    provision of management and other services to third parties and
    the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions.
    Taxable REIT subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular
    corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and
    local income taxes.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation
    primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities
    and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a
    term of one year or less, which generally enables us to
    compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on
    our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy
    and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and
    their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this
    has had a material impact on our results for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Environmental
    Matters

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing
    operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include
    those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials
    in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and
    notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active
    underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management
    activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could
    subject us to a government enforcement action

and/or

claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental
    protection regulations has not had a material effect on our
    capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have
    a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of
    the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports
    have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition,
    all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition.
    The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental
    consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the
    purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is
    possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all
    environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental
    liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we
    have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions
    because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials
    have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the
    potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required
    to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties.
    We believe that through professional environmental inspections
    and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous
    materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward
    accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure
    to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential
    housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential
    residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
    hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such
    notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the
    communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in
    that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint
    are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any
    such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by
    children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our
    properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a
    material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.
    We have not been



notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise
    aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim
    relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of
    our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued
    compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations
    will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial
    condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws,
    regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional
    remediation of existing conditions that are not currently
    actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on
    us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material
    adverse effect on us and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our
    communities, with limits of liability customary within the
    industry to insure against liability claims and related defense
    costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary
    within the industry, against the risk of direct physical damage
    in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis
    for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including
    loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

There are many factors that affect our business and our results
    of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The
    following is a description of important factors that may cause
    our actual results of operations in future periods to differ
    materially from those currently expected or discussed in
    forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to
    our financial results, operations and business prospects. Except
    as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any
    such forward-looking statements to reflect events or
    circumstances after the date on which it is made.

Risks
    Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Our
    Operations

Unfavorable Apartment Market and Economic Conditions Could
    Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels, Rental Revenues and the Value
    of Our Real Estate Assets.

Unfavorable market
    conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable
    economic conditions generally may significantly affect our
    occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of
    the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or
    dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable
    terms. Some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments
    and real estate taxes, generally do not decline when related
    rents decline. We would expect that declines in our occupancy
    levels, rental revenues

and/or

the
    values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less
    cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our
    stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial
    condition and the market value of our securities. Factors that
    may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues,

and/or

the
    value of our properties include the following, among others:

•

downturns in the national, regional and local economic
    conditions, particularly increases in unemployment;

•

declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing
    more affordable;

•

government or builder incentives which enable first time
    homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative
    housing options more attractive;

•

local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or
    reduced demand for, apartment homes;

•

declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may
    make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;

•

changes in market rental rates;



•

the timing and costs associated with property improvements,
    repairs or renovations;

•

declines in household formation; and

•

rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating
    rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to
    offset increases in operating costs.

We Are Subject to Certain Risks Associated with Selling
    Apartment Communities, Which Could Limit Our Operational and
    Financial Flexibility.

We have periodically
    disposed of apartment communities that no longer meet our
    strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it
    difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own,
    and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to
    us. These conditions may limit our ability to dispose of
    properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet
    our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a materially
    adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value
    of our securities. We are also subject to the following risks in
    connection with sales of our apartment communities:

•

a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property
    sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to
    qualify as like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the
    Code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for
    federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may not have
    immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our
    property sales; and

•

federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of
    communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this
    limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market
    conditions are favorable.

Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease Apartment Homes
    or Increase or Maintain Rents.

Our apartment
    communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in
    attracting residents, including other apartment communities,
    condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner
    occupied single- and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in
    a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease
    apartment homes and increase or maintain rents.

We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of Past or Future
    Acquisitions, and the Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities
    and New Personnel Successfully Could Create
    Inefficiencies.

We have selectively acquired in
    the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we
    intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment
    communities that meet our investment criteria. Our acquisition
    activities and their success are subject to the following risks:

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on
    favorable terms or at all;

•

even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment
    community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after
    incurring certain acquisition-related costs;

•

an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we
    expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure
    related to the acquired property may go undetected during our
    due diligence procedures;

•

when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional
    amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability,
    and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated
    improvements in profitability; and

•

we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired
    apartment communities and new personnel into our existing
    operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such
    apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies
    that could adversely affect our expected return on our
    investments and our overall profitability.

We do not expect to acquire apartment communities at the rate we
    have in prior years, which may limit our growth and have a
    material adverse effect on our business and the market value of
    our securities. In the past, other real estate investors,
    including insurance companies, pension and investment funds,
    developer partnerships, investment companies and other public
    and private apartment REITs, have competed with us to



acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and
    such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us
    to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable
    terms, which could adversely affect growth.

Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our
    Profitability.

In the past we have selectively
    pursued the development and construction of apartment
    communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate
    opportunities arise. Development activities have been, and in
    the future may be, conducted through wholly owned affiliated
    companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties.
    Our development and construction activities are subject to the
    following risks:

•

we may be unable to obtain construction financing for
    development activities under favorable terms, including but not
    limited to interest rates, maturity dates

and/or

loan
    to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even
    abandon potential developments;

•

we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining,
    necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other
    required governmental permits and authorizations, which could
    result in increased development costs, could delay initial
    occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community,
    and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with
    respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits
    or authorizations;

•

yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in
    completing projects, costs that exceed budget

and/or

higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents
    than pro forma;

•

if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the
    development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable
    financing for the developments, our development capacity may be
    limited;

•

we may abandon development opportunities that we have already
    begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already
    incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;

•

we may be unable to complete construction and

lease-up

of
    a community on schedule, or incur development or construction
    costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable
    to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such
    costs;

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may
    fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and
    economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our
    profitability goals for that community; and

•

when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we
    developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or
    construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the
    limits of our insurance.

In some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired
    communities exceeded our original estimates. We may experience
    similar cost increases in the future. Our inability to charge
    rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any
    increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Some Potential Losses May Not Be Adequately Covered by
    Insurance.

We have a comprehensive insurance
    program covering our property and operating activities. We
    believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these
    policies are adequate and appropriate. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be
    adequately covered under our insurance program. In addition, we
    will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured
    retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess
    of applicable coverage.

If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits
    occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have
    invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future
    revenue from the property. In such an event, we might
    nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other
    financial obligations related to the property. Material losses
    in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. If one
    or more of our significant properties were to experience a
    catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations,
    delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild
    the property. Such events could adversely affect our cash flow
    and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.



Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our
    Growth.

We have acquired in the past, and we may
    acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise,
    apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets.
    Entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks,
    and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets.
    These risks include, among others:

•

inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market
    conditions and local economies;

•

inability to hire and retain key personnel;

•

lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting
    procedures; and

•

inability to achieve budgeted financial results.

Risk of Inflation/Deflation.

Substantial
    inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative
    effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. Although
    inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the
    recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced
    negative impact on our debt interest and general and
    administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate
    higher than our rental rates.

Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could
    Result in Substantial Costs.

Under various
    federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or
    former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to
    investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of
    currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic
    substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or
    responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our
    current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. In
    addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or
    to third parties for property damage and for investigation and

clean-up

costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs
    could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws
    create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure
    their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to
    properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially
    and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent
    an affected property.

Property Ownership Through Joint Ventures May Limit Our
    Ability to Act Exclusively in Our Interest.

We
    have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire
    properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when
    we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. If
    we use such a structure, we could become engaged in a dispute
    with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect
    our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. Moreover, joint
    venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives
    that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives
    that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or
    refinancing of a property. In some instances, joint venture
    partners may have competing interests in our markets that could
    create conflicts of interest.

Compliance or Failure to Comply with the Americans with
    Disabilities Act of 1990 or Other Safety Regulations and
    Requirements Could Result in Substantial
    Costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act
    generally requires that public buildings, including our
    properties, be made accessible to disabled persons.
    Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the
    federal government or the award of damages to private litigants.
    From time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect
    to some of our properties under this Act. If, under the
    Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make
    substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more
    of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it
    could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local
    regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life
    safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these
    requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We
    do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether
    compliance with future requirements will require significant
    unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and
    results of operations.

Real Estate Tax and Other Laws.

Generally we
    do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance
    with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property
    tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in
    income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. These
    costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability
    to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance
    with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential
    liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or
    the



restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent
    control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating
    housing, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the
    Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, may result in significant
    unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds
    from operations and the ability to make distributions to
    stockholders.

Risk of Damage from Catastrophic Weather
    Events.

Certain of our communities are located in
    the general vicinity of active earthquake faults, mudslides and
    fires, and others where there are hurricanes, tornadoes or risks
    of other inclement weather. The adverse weather events could
    cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels.
    In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could
    lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as
    anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also
    continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or
    other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could
    materially and adversely affect our business and our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Actual or Threatened Terrorist Attacks May Have an Adverse
    Effect on Our Business and Operating Results and Could Decrease
    the Value of Our Assets.

Actual or threatened
    terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
    Attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment
    communities could significantly affect our ability to operate
    those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our
    expected results. Further, our insurance coverage may not cover
    all losses caused by a terrorist attack. In addition, the
    adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future
    attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have
    a material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

Any Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Stock
    Price.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal
    control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more
    material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
    reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and
    completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have
    an adverse effect on our stock price.

Our Success Depends on Our Senior
    Management.

Our success depends upon the
    retention of our senior management, whose continued service in
    not guaranteed. We may not be able to find qualified
    replacements for the individuals who make up our senior
    management if their services should no longer be available to
    us. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior
    management team could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and
    Create Refinancing Risk.

We are subject to the
    risks normally associated with debt financing, including the
    risk that our operating income and cash flow will be
    insufficient to make required payments of principal and
    interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our
    line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash
    flow may not be available to make all required principal
    payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to
    maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available
    to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints
    of our debt covenants. Additionally, we are likely to need to
    refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it
    matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the
    terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of
    the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets
    or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose
    to do so. In addition, our failure to comply with our debt
    covenants could result in a requirement to repay our
    indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse
    effect on our cash flow and increase our financing costs.

Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt
    Service Payments and Distributions to
    Stockholders.

If our apartment communities do not
    generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses,
    our ability to make required payments of interest and principal
    on our debt securities and to pay



distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected.
    The following factors, among others, may affect the net rental
    income generated by our apartment communities:

•

the national and local economies;

•

local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of
    apartment homes;

•

tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience, and
    attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where
    they are located;

•

our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and
    insurance;

•

rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities;

•

changes in interest rates and the availability of
    financing; and

•

changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent
    control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing.

Expenses associated with our investment in an apartment
    community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance
    and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when
    circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that
    community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt
    and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could
    sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or
    the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.

Debt Level May Be Increased.

Our current
    debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of
    debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is
    limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We
    manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants,
    but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase
    the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent
    improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.

Financing May Not Be Available and Could Be
    Dilutive.

Our ability to execute our business
    strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt
    financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms
    of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including
    common and preferred equity. We and other companies in the real
    estate industry have experienced limited availability of
    financing from time to time. If we issue additional equity
    securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of
    incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could
    be diluted.

Financing Could be Impacted by Negative Capital Market
    Conditions.

Recently, domestic financial markets
    have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty. While this
    condition has occurred most visibly within the
    “subprime” mortgage lending sector of the credit
    market, liquidity has tightened in overall domestic financial
    markets, including the investment grade debt and equity capital
    markets. Consequently, there is greater risk that the financial
    institutions we do business with could experience disruptions
    that would negatively affect our ability to obtain financing.

Disruptions in Financial Markets May Adversely Impact
    Availability and Cost of Credit, Impact Our Tenant Base, and
    Have other Adverse Effects on Us and the Market Price of Our
    Stock.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or
    to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and
    financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing
    economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors
    beyond our control. The United States stock and credit markets
    have recently experienced significant price volatility,
    dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market
    prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads
    on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These
    circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the
    financial markets, making terms for certain financings less
    attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the
    unavailability of financing. Continued uncertainty in the stock
    and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access
    additional financing for acquisitions, development of our
    properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may
    negatively affect our business. Additionally, due to this
    uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing
    indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as
    favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. If we are
    not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due, we
    may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms,
    which might



adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet
    our other obligations. A prolonged downturn in the financial
    markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially
    less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our
    business plan accordingly. These events also may make it more
    difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance
    of our common or preferred stock. The disruptions in the
    financial markets have had and may continue to have a material
    adverse effect on the market value of our common shares and
    other adverse effects on us and our business.

Prospective buyers of our properties may also experience
    difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more
    difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing
    levels. Current tightening of credit in financial markets and
    increasing unemployment may also adversely affect the ability of
    tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue
    increasing rents on a prospective basis. Disruptions in the
    credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects
    on us and the overall economy.

The Soundness of Financial Institutions Could Adversely
    Affect Us.

We have relationships with many
    financial institutions, including lenders under our credit
    facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with
    counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result,
    defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial
    institutions or the financial services industry generally, could
    result in losses or defaults by these institutions. In the event
    that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects
    these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other
    parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete
    transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our
    business and results of operations.

Changing Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and
    Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow and the Market Price of Our
    Securities.

We currently have, and expect to
    incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary
    with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, we had
    approximately $709.2 million of variable rate indebtedness
    outstanding, which constitutes approximately 20.7% of our total
    outstanding indebtedness as of such date. An increase in
    interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase
    the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing
    new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely
    affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make
    distributions to security holders. The effect of prolonged
    interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to
    make acquisitions and develop properties. In addition, an
    increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders
    to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect
    the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt
    securities.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May
    Result in Material Charges.

From time to time
    when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit
    our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period
    prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest
    rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the
    predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time
    we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our
    exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in
    market interest rates. If the terms of new debt securities are
    not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall
    below that which we incur under a particular interest rate
    hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore, the
    settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and
    may in the future involve material charges.

Risks
    Related to Tax Laws

We Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if We Fail to Qualify
    as a REIT.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT
    under the Code. Our qualification as a REIT requires us to
    satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly
    basis, established under highly technical and complex Code
    provisions for which there are only limited judicial or
    administrative interpretations, and involves the determination
    of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within
    our control. We intend that our current organization and method
    of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT, but we
    may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified
    in the future. In addition, U.S. federal income tax laws
    governing REITs and other corporations and the administrative
    interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time,
    potentially with retroactive effect. Future legislation, new
    regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions
    could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or
    adversely affect our stockholders.



If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be
    subject to federal income tax (including any applicable
    alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular
    corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends
    paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. Also,
    unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under
    certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from
    treatment as a REIT for the two taxable years following the year
    in which we first failed to qualify. The additional tax
    liability from the failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce or
    eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or
    distribution to our stockholders. This would likely have a
    significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and
    our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we would
    no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.
    Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be
    subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income
    and property.

REITs May Pay a Portion of Dividends in Common
    Stock.

In December 2009, the Internal Revenue
    Service issued Revenue Procedure

2010-12,

which expanded previously issued temporary guidance relating to
    certain stock distributions made by publicly traded REITs to
    satisfy their tax-related distribution requirements. This
    expanded temporary guidance is intended to permit REITs to limit
    cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the
    current downturn in economic conditions. Under this expanded
    guidance, for stock dividends declared on or after
    January 1, 2008 and before December 31, 2012, with
    respect to a taxable year ending on or before December 31,
    2011, the Internal Revenue Service will treat a distribution of
    stock by a publicly traded REIT, pursuant to certain stockholder
    elections to receive either stock or cash, as a taxable
    distribution of property, provided that, among other conditions,
    (i) the total amount of cash available for distribution is
    not less than 10% of the aggregate declared distribution, and
    (ii) if too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each
    stockholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata
    amount of cash corresponding to its respective entitlement under
    the declaration, but in no event will any such electing
    stockholder receive less than 10% of the stockholder’s
    entire entitlement in money. The amount of such stock
    distribution will generally be treated as equal to the amount of
    cash that could have been received instead. If we pay a portion
    of our dividends in shares of our common stock pursuant to this
    temporary guidance, our stockholders may receive less cash than
    they received in distributions in prior years and the market
    value of our securities may decline.

We May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable REIT
    Subsidiaries, Which are Subject to Certain Tax
    Risks.

We have established several taxable REIT
    subsidiaries. Despite our qualification as a REIT, our taxable
    REIT subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income.
    In addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to
    qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and our
    income from and investments in our taxable REIT subsidiaries
    generally do not constitute permissible income and investments
    for these tests. While we will attempt to ensure that our
    dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not adversely
    affect our REIT qualification, we cannot provide assurance that
    we will successfully achieve that result. Furthermore, we may be
    subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to
    retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our
    dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be
    arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected.

REIT Distribution Requirements Limit Our Available
    Cash.

As a REIT, we are subject to annual
    distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we
    retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund
    our growth. We generally must distribute annually at least 90%
    of our net REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain,
    in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to
    corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to our
    stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code.
    However, differences in timing between the recognition of
    taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us
    to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term
    basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code.

Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited
    Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain
    Attributable to the Transaction.

From time to
    time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our
    properties. Under the Code, any gain resulting from transfers of
    properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to
    customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as
    income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100%
    penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment
    purposes,



we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of
    property are prohibited transactions. However, whether property
    is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that
    depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the
    particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend
    that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are
    prohibited transactions. If the Internal Revenue Service were to
    argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property
    constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required
    to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the
    prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to
    retain future gains on real property sales. In addition, income
    from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability
    to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT for
    federal income tax purposes.

We Could Face Possible State and Local Tax Audits and Adverse
    Changes in State and Local Tax Laws.

As discussed
    in the risk factors above, because we are organized and qualify
    as a REIT we are generally not subject to federal income taxes,
    but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. From time
    to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are
    enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A
    shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which
    we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the
    frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we
    may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. These
    increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial
    condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of
    distributions to our stockholders. In the normal course of
    business, entities through which we own real estate may also
    become subject to tax audits. If such entities become subject to
    state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits
    could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

Risks
    Related to Our Organization and Our Shares

Changes in Market Conditions and Volatility of Stock Prices
    Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common
    Stock.

The stock markets, including the New York
    Stock Exchange, on which we list our common shares, have
    experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a
    result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly
    volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a
    decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases
    unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.

The market price per share of our common stock may decline or
    fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including:

•

general market and economic conditions,

•

actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating
    results or dividends or our payment of dividends in shares of
    our stock,

•

changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates,

•

difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or
    refinance existing debt,

•

decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations,

•

publication of research reports about us or the real estate
    industry,

•

the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the
    attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other
    equity securities (including securities issued by other real
    estate-based companies),

•

general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in
    interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead
    prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual
    yield from future dividends,

•

a change in analyst ratings,

•

adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the
    future,

•

speculation in the press or investment community,



•

terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in
    which our securities trade, possibly increasing market
    volatility and causing the further erosion of business and
    consumer confidence and spending,

•

governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws, and

•

the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or the
    perception that such sales might occur, including under our

at-the-market

equity distribution program.

Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These
    factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock
    to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of
    operations, business or our prospects.

We May Change the Dividend Policy for Our Common Stock in the
    Future.

The decision to declare and pay dividends
    on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount
    and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the
    sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our
    earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition,
    capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other
    limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution
    requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, state law
    and such other factors as our Board of Directors considers
    relevant. Any change in our dividend policy could have a
    material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.

Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to
    Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in Our
    Stockholders’ Best Interests.

Maryland
    business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to
    acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject
    to various Maryland laws which may have the effect of
    discouraging offers to acquire our Company and of increasing the
    difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our
    acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests.
    The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other
    business combination transactions between us and any person who
    acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock
    representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board
    of directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination
    transaction could not be completed until five years after the
    person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the
    approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled
    to be cast and


/


%
    of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested
    stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also
    provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our
    equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of
    the voting power in electing directors will have no voting
    rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares
    eligible to vote.

Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability
    of Our Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company
    May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to Our
    Stockholders.

One of the requirements for
    maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal
    income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our
    outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer
    individuals, including entities specified in the Code, during
    the last half of any taxable year. Our charter contains
    ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock
    primarily to assist us in complying with this and other REIT
    ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the
    effect of preventing a change of control, which does not
    threaten REIT status. These restrictions include a provision
    that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9%
    of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board
    of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation,
    provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to
    exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. These
    provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
    preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a
    change of control might involve a premium price for our
    stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’
    best interests.

We declared a Special Dividend on our common stock on
    November 5, 2008 of $0.96 per share in addition to our
    quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, which represented an
    aggregate dividend of approximately $1.29 per share or
    $177.1 million. The aggregate amount of cash that the
    Company paid to stockholders related to the 2008 fourth quarter
    distribution was $44.0 million. In connection with the
    Special Dividend the Company issued 11,358,042 shares
    ($133.1 million) of our common stock to our stockholders on
    January 29, 2009.

On February 19, 2010, the closing sale price of our common
    stock was $16.31 per share on the NYSE and there were 5,060
    holders of record of the 156,058,930 outstanding shares of our
    common stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax purposes,
    approximately 12% of the distributions for 2009 represented
    ordinary income, 80% represented long-term capital gain, and 8%
    represented unrecaptured section 1250 gain.

We pay regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common
    stock. Future distributions will be at the discretion of our
    Board of Directors and will depend on our actual funds from
    operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the
    annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of
    the Code, and other factors. The annual distribution payment for
    calendar year 2009 necessary for us to maintain our status as a
    REIT was approximately $0.04 per share of common stock. We
    declared total distributions of $0.85 per share of common stock
    for 2009.

Series E
    Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
    (“Series E”) has no stated par value and a
    liquidation preference of $16.61 per share. Subject to certain
    adjustments and conditions, each share of the Series E is
    convertible at any time and from time to time at the
    holder’s option into one share of our common stock prior to
    the Special Dividend. The holders of the Series E are
    entitled to vote on an as-converted basis as a single class in
    combination with the holders of common stock at any meeting of
    our stockholders for the election of directors or for any other
    purpose on which the holders of common stock are entitled to
    vote. The Series E has no stated maturity and is not
    subject to any sinking fund or any mandatory redemption. In
    connection with the Special Dividend, the Company reserved for
    issuance upon conversion of the Series E



additional shares of common stock to which a holder of the
    Series E would have received if the holder had converted
    the Series E immediately prior to the record date for the
    Special Dividend.

Distributions declared on the Series E in 2009 were $1.33
    per share or $0.3322 per quarter. The Series E is not
    listed on any exchange. At December 31, 2009, a total of
    2,803,812 shares of the Series E were outstanding.

Series F
    Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of our
    Series F Preferred Stock. Our Series F Preferred Stock
    may be purchased by holders of our operating partnership units,
    or OP Units, described below under “Operating
    Partnership Units,” at a purchase price of $0.0001 per
    share. OP Unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and
    purchase one share of our Series F Preferred Stock for each
    OP Unit held. At December 31, 2009, a total of
    2,959,428 shares of the Series F Preferred Stock were
    outstanding at a value of $296. Holders of the Series F
    Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for each share of the
    Series F Preferred Stock they hold, voting together with
    the holders of our common stock, on each matter submitted to a
    vote of securityholders at a meeting of our stockholders. The
    Series F Preferred Stock does not entitle its holders to
    any other rights, privileges or preferences.

Series G
    Preferred Stock

In May 2007, UDR issued 5,400,000 shares of our 6.75%
    Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock
    (Series G). The Series G has no stated par value and a
    liquidation preference of $25 per share. The Series G
    generally has no voting rights except under certain limited
    circumstances and as required by law. The Series G has no
    stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or
    mandatory redemption and is not convertible into any of our
    other securities. The Series G is not redeemable prior to
    May 31, 2012. On or after this date, the Series G may
    be redeemed for cash at our option, in whole or in part, at a
    redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid
    dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company repurchased 997,738 shares of Series G, for
    less than the liquidation preference of $25 per share resulting
    in a $2.6 million benefit to our net loss attributable to
    common stockholders. Distributions declared on the Series G
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.69 per share.
    The Series G is listed on the NYSE under the symbol
    “UDRPrG.” At December 31, 2009, a total of
    3,432,962 shares of the Series G were outstanding.

Dividend
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under
    which holders of our common stock may elect to automatically
    reinvest their distributions and make additional cash payments
    to acquire additional shares of our common stock. Stockholders
    who do not participate in the plan continue to receive dividends
    as declared. As of February 12, 2010, there were
    approximately 2,900 participants in the plan.

Operating
    Partnership Units

From time to time we issue shares of our common stock in
    exchange for operating partnership units
    (“OP Units”) tendered to our operating
    partnerships, United Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage
    Communities L.P., for redemption in accordance with the
    provisions of their respective partnership agreements.

The holder of the OP Units has the right to require United
    Dominion Realty, L.P. to redeem all or a portion of the
    OP Units held by the holder in exchange for a cash payment
    based on the market value of our common stock at the time of
    redemption. However, United Dominion Realty, L.P.’s
    obligation to pay the cash amount is subject to the prior right
    of the Company to acquire such OP Units in exchange for
    either the cash amount or shares of our common stock. During
    2009, we issued a total of 1,837,792 shares of common stock
    upon redemption of OP Units. At December 31, 2009
    there were 5,986,588 OP Units in United Dominion Realty,
    L.P. that were owned by limited partners.

Heritage Communities L.P. OP Units are convertible into
    common stock in lieu of cash, at our option, once the holder
    elects to convert, at an exchange ratio of 1.575 shares for
    each OP Unit. During 2009, we



issued a total of 292,660 shares of common stock upon
    redemption of OP Units. At December 31, 2009, there
    were no OP Units in Heritage Communities L.P. that were
    owned by limited partners.

Purchases
    of Equity Securities

In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a
    10 million share repurchase program. In January 2008, our
    Board of Directors authorized a new 15 million share
    repurchase program. Under the two share repurchase programs, UDR
    may repurchase shares of our common stock in open market
    purchases, block purchases, privately negotiated transactions or
    otherwise. As reflected in the table below, no shares of common
    stock were repurchased under these programs during the quarter
    ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased
    100,000 shares of our common stock under these programs.

The following tables set forth certain information regarding our
    common stock repurchases during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2009.

Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities

On March 23, 2009, March 27, 2009 and May 13,
    2009, the Company issued and sold 2,237,282; 25,126; and
    30,727 shares, respectively, of its Series F Preferred
    Stock, without par value, at a purchase price of $0.0001 per
    share, for an aggregate purchase price of $223.73, $2.52 and
    $3.07, respectively. The shares of the Series F Preferred
    Stock were sold to certain accredited investors who hold limited
    partnership interests, or OP Units, in United Dominion
    Realty, L.P. Because the shares of Series F Preferred Stock
    described above were sold to accredited investors in
    transactions not involving a public offering, the transactions
    are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in
    accordance with Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

Business
    Overview

We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns,
    acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities
    nationwide. We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In
    June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia
    to Maryland. Our subsidiaries include two operating
    partnerships, Heritage Communities L.P., a Delaware limited
    partnership, and United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware
    limited partnership. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
    references in this Report to “we,” “us,”
    “our,” “the Company,” or “UDR”
    refer collectively to UDR, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2009, our consolidated real estate
    portfolio included 165 communities with 45,913 apartment homes
    and our total real estate portfolio, inclusive of our
    unconsolidated communities, included an additional 10
    communities with 3,992 apartment homes.

    homes that have not yet been completed.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial
    obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale of
    properties, and the issuance of debt and equity. Both the
    coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective
    capital management are important to the maintenance of
    liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from
    operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and
    operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes
    and borrowings under credit agreements. We routinely use our
    unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing
    and financing activities prior to



arranging for longer-term financing or the issuance of equity or
    debt securities. During the past several years, proceeds from
    the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and
    financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements
    generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings
    under credit agreements. We expect to meet certain long-term
    liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the
    repayment of financing on development activities, and potential
    property acquisitions, through secured and unsecured borrowings,
    the issuance of debt or equity securities, and the disposition
    of properties. We believe that our net cash provided by
    operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue
    to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the
    payment of dividends by the Company in accordance with REIT
    requirements. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for
    improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected
    to be funded from property operations, borrowings under credit
    agreements, and the issuance of debt or equity securities.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which
    provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common
    stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, warrants,
    subscription rights, purchase contracts and units to facilitate
    future financing activities in the public capital markets.
    Access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at
    the time of issuance.

On September 15, 2009, the Company entered into an equity
    distribution agreement under which the Company may offer and
    sell up to 15.0 million shares of its common stock over
    time to or through its sales agents. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we sold 4,460,032 shares of common
    stock through this program for aggregate gross proceeds of
    approximately $69.1 million at a weighted average price per
    share of $15.48. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after
    deducting related expenses, including commissions paid to the
    sales agents of approximately $1.4 million and related
    issuance costs of approximately $500,000, were approximately
    $67.2 million.

On December 7, 2009, the Company entered into an amended
    and restated distribution agreement with respect to the issue
    and sale by the Company from time to time of its Medium-Term
    Notes, Series A Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue.
    As of December 31, 2009, the Company had not issued any
    medium-term notes under the amended and restated distribution
    agreement dated December 7, 2009.

Future
    Capital Needs

Future development expenditures are expected to be funded with
    proceeds from construction loans, through joint ventures,
    unsecured or secured credit facilities, proceeds from the
    issuance of equity or debt securities, the sale of properties
    and to a lesser extent, with cash flows provided by operating
    activities. Acquisition activity in strategic markets is
    expected to be largely financed by the reinvestment of proceeds
    from the sale of properties, through the issuance of equity or
    debt securities, the issuance of operating partnership units,
    and the assumption or placement of secured

and/or

unsecured debt.

During 2010, we have approximately $237.4 million of
    secured debt and $50.0 million of unsecured debt maturing
    and we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from
    borrowings under our secured or unsecured credit facilities, the
    issuance of equity or debt securities, and by exercising
    extension rights of $151.5 million with respect to secured
    debt.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to use judgment in the application of
    accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.
    A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to
    our financial condition and results of operations as well as
    involves some degree of uncertainty. Estimates are prepared
    based on management’s assessment after considering all
    evidence available. Changes in estimates could affect our
    financial position or results of operations. Below is a
    discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical
    to understanding our financial condition or results of
    operations where there is uncertainty or where significant
    judgment is required.



Capital
    Expenditures

In conformity with GAAP, we capitalize those expenditures that
    materially enhance the value of an existing asset or
    substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset.
    Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in
    ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.

During 2009, $86.4 million or $1,986 per home was spent on
    capital expenditures for all of our communities, excluding
    development, condominium conversions and commercial properties
    compared to $131.0 million or $2,838 per home spent in
    2008. These capital improvements included turnover related
    expenditures for floor coverings and appliances, other recurring
    capital expenditures such as exterior paint, roofs, siding,
    parking lots, and asset preservation capital expenditures, which
    aggregated $29.3 million or $674 per home for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. In addition, revenue enhancing
    capital expenditures, kitchen and bath upgrades, and other
    extensive exterior/interior upgrades totaled $23.6 million
    or $543 per home, and major renovations totaled
    $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

The following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and
    maintenance costs for all of our communities, excluding real
    estate under development, condominium conversions and commercial
    properties, for the periods presented:

We will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing

    investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital.
    Recurring capital expenditures during 2010 are currently
    expected to be approximately $1,000 per home.

Investment
    in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codificiation
    (“ASC”)

323-10,

Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures

(formerly
    APB Opinion 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for
    Investments in Common Stock”) (“Subtopic

323-10”),

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint
    ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    there may be an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a
    decrease in the value of the investment is

other-than-temporary.

These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the
    venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the
    entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the
    entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture
    partners and its lenders. The amount of loss recognized is the
    excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its
    estimated fair value. If we believe that the decline in fair
    value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. The
    aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in
    determining the valuation of our investment property. Should the
    actual results differ from management’s judgment, the
    valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a
    negative impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.



Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
    operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
    assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
    estimated to be generated by the future operation and
    disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of
    those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical
    results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market
    and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The
    net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market
    value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best
    estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market
    rates and transactions.

Real
    Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time
    and allocate the purchase price to various components, such as
    land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases in
    accordance with FASB ASC 805,

Business Combinations

(formerly SFAS 141R, “Business
    Combinations”). The purchase price is allocated based on
    the relative fair value of each component. The fair value of
    buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon
    acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As
    such, the determination of fair value considers the present
    value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the
    property including an initial

lease-up

period. We determine the fair value of in-place leases by
    assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease
    relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In
    addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the
    foregone rents associated with the

lease-up

period, and the carrying costs associated with the

lease-up

period. The fair value of in-place leases is recorded and
    amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual
    lease period.

REIT
    Status

We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for
    federal income tax purposes as a REIT. A REIT is a legal entity
    that holds interests in real estate and is required by the Code
    to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements,
    including a requirement that a REIT must distribute at least 90%
    of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to
    our stockholders. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any
    taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income
    taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to
    qualify as a REIT for four years. Based on the net earnings
    reported for the year ended December 31, 2009 in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations we would have incurred
    immaterial federal and state GAAP income taxes if we had failed
    to qualify as a REIT.

Statements
    of Cash Flow

The following discussion explains the changes in net cash
    provided by operating activities and net cash provided by/(used
    in) investing and financing activities that are presented in our
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Operating
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash flow
    provided by operating activities was $229.4 million
    compared to $179.8 million for 2008. The increase in cash
    flow from operating activities is primarily due to changes in
    operating liabilities and is partially offset by a reduction in
    property operating income.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, our net cash flow
    provided by operating activities was $179.8 million
    compared to $269.3 million for 2007. During 2008, the
    decrease in cash flow from operating activities resulted
    primarily from a reduction in property operating income from our
    apartment community portfolio and a significant reduction in
    operating liabilities. The reduction in property operating
    income was driven by the Company completing the sale of a
    significant component of our portfolio in the first quarter of
    2008. A portion of the proceeds from the disposition were
    reinvested in subsequent quarters which diluted the net cash
    provided by operations for the period in which the Company held
    restricted 1031 cash funds in lieu of revenue generating
    operating communities.



Investing
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash used in
    investing activities was $158.0 million compared to net
    cash provided by investing activities of $302.3 million for
    2008. The change is primarily driven by a reduction in the
    disposition of real estate investments partially offset by a
    reduction in the acquisition of real estate assets and capital
    expenditures, all of which are discussed in further detail
    throughout this Report.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash provided by
    investing activities was $302.3 million compared to net
    cash used in investing activities of $90.1 million for
    2007. Changes in the level of investing activities from period
    to period reflects our strategy as it relates to acquisitions,
    capital expenditures, development and disposition activities, as
    well as the impact of the capital market environment on these
    activities, all of which are discussed in further detail
    throughout this Report.

Acquisitions

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we acquired one
    community in Dallas, Texas with 289 units for
    $28.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
    we acquired 13 apartment communities with 4,558 apartment homes,
    two parcels of land, and one retail property for aggregate
    consideration of $1.0 billion. Our long-term strategic plan
    is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in
    fewer, more concentrated markets. As a result, we have been
    expanding our interests in communities located in California,
    Florida, Metropolitan D.C. and the Washington State markets over
    the past years. Prospectively, we plan to continue to channel
    new investments into those markets we believe will provide the
    best investment returns. Markets will be targeted based upon
    defined criteria including favorable job formation, low
    single-family home affordability and favorable demand/supply
    ratio for multifamily housing.

Real
    Estate Under Development

At December 31, 2009, our development pipeline for
    wholly-owned communities totaled 1,576 homes with a budget of
    $258.6 million in which we have a carrying value of
    $216.9 million. We anticipate the completion of these
    communities during 2010.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we invested
    approximately $183.2 million in development projects, an
    increase of $23.1 million from our 2008 level of
    $160.1 million. As a result of our investment in
    developments, we completed development on three wholly-owned
    communities with 831 apartment homes that have a carrying value
    of $119.5 million.

Consolidated
    Joint Ventures

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Elements Too”) which is developing a 274
    home apartment community in the central business district of
    Bellevue, Washington. Construction began in the fourth quarter
    of 2006 and is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of
    2010. At closing and at December 31, 2008, we owned 49% of
    the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $10.0 million. On October 16, 2009, our partner in the
    joint venture resigned as managing member and appointed UDR as
    managing member. In addition, our partner relinquished its
    voting rights and approval rights and its ability to
    substantively participate in the decision-making process of the
    joint venture. As a result of UDR’s appointment as managing
    member, the Company is required to consolidate the joint
    venture. On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into an
    agreement with our partner to purchase its 49% interest in
    Elements Too for $3.2 million (outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). Upon closing of the agreement, the
    Company’s equity interest in Elements Too will be 98%.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“989 Elements”) which owns and operates a
    23-story, 166 home high-rise apartment community in the central
    business district of Bellevue, Washington. At closing, UDR owned
    49% of the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $11.8 million. On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into
    an agreement with our partner to purchase 49% of its interest in
    989 Elements in consideration for $7.8 million (outstanding
    at December 31, 2009). Concurrently, our partner resigned
    as managing member and appointed UDR as managing member. In
    addition, our partner relinquished



its voting rights and approval rights and its ability to
    substantively participate in the decision-making process of the
    joint venture. At closing, the Company’s interest will
    increase to 98%.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Bellevue Plaza”) which owns an operating
    retail site in Bellevue, Washington. The Company initially
    planned to develop a 430 home high rise apartment building with
    ground floor retail on an existing operating retail center.
    However, during the year ended December 31, 2009, the joint
    venture decided to continue to operate the retail property as
    opposed to developing the site. On December 30, 2009, UDR
    entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49%
    interest in Bellevue Plaza for $5.2 million (outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). In addition, our partner resigned as
    managing member and appointed UDR as managing member. Concurrent
    with its resignation, our partner relinquished its voting rights
    and approval rights and its ability to substantively participate
    in the decision-making process of the joint venture. At closing,
    the Company will increase its interest in Bellevue Plaza from
    49% to 98%.

For additional information regarding these joint ventures, see
    Note 4, “Joint Ventures,” in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in this Report.

During 2009, the Company established a joint venture with Kuwait
    Finance House for the investment of up to $450.0 million in
    multifamily properties located in key, high barrier to entry
    markets. The partners will contribute equity of
    $180.0 million of which the Company’s maximum equity
    contribution will be 30% or $54.0 million when fully
    invested. At closing, we owned 30% of the joint venture. Our
    investment at December 31, 2009 was $242,000. At
    December 31, 2009, the joint venture did not hold any
    property.

Disposition
    of Investments

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we did not dispose
    of any communities. During the year ended December 31,
    2008, UDR sold 86 communities with a total of 25,684 apartment
    homes, for gross consideration of $1.7 billion, 53
    condominiums from two communities with a total of 640
    condominiums for gross consideration of $6.9 million, one
    parcel of land for gross proceeds of $1.6 million and one
    commercial property for gross proceeds of $6.5 million. We
    recognized after-tax gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $786.4 million on these sales. Proceeds from the sales were
    used primarily to acquire new communities and reduce debt.
    During 2008, we decided to discontinue sales of units with the
    two communities identified for condominium conversion until such
    time that the market conditions turn favorable and it is
    economically beneficial to sell those units versus operate the
    residual 525 units of those communities. As a result of our
    decision to revert the remaining units to operations the Company
    recorded a charge to earnings of $1.7 million, excluding
    the catch up for depreciation on the units when they were
    returned to operations.

As a result of our disposition activities in 2008, the Company
    declared a Special Dividend payable to holders of our common
    stock for $0.96 per share included with our recurring
    distribution for the Company’s fourth quarter of 2008 for a
    total of $1.29 per share payable on January 29, 2009 to
    stockholders of record on December 9, 2008. Additional
    information regarding the Special Dividend is set forth in
    Item 1. Business in Part 1 of this Report.

In conjunction with the transaction in which we sold 86
    communities for $1.7 billion, we received a note in the
    amount of $200.0 million. The note was paid in full during
    the year ended December 31, 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, UDR sold 21
    communities with a total of 7,125 apartment homes for gross
    consideration of $729.2 million, one parcel of land for
    $4.5 million, and contributed one property under
    development, at cost, to a joint venture arrangement in Texas.
    In addition, we sold 61 condominiums from two communities with a
    total of 640 condominiums for gross consideration of
    $10.4 million. We recognized after-tax gains for financial
    reporting purposes of $239.1 million on these sales.
    Proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt.

Financing
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash used in
    financing activities was $78.1 million compared to
    $472.5 million for the comparable period of 2008.



The following significant financing activity occurred during the
    year ended December 31, 2009:

•

Repaid $159.6 million of secured debt and
    $658.2 million of unsecured debt (represents the notional
    amount of debt repaid and excludes the gain on extinguishment).
    The $658.2 million of unsecured debt includes the
    prepayment of our $240 million term loan,
    $141.9 million for maturing medium-term notes and
    $276.3 million for the repurchase of unsecured debt. The
    unsecured debt repurchases includes the tender offer of
    $37.5 million in aggregate principle amount of our
    8.50% debentures due September 15, 2024 for
    $41.2 million of cash.

•

Repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $238.9 million for $222.3 million, which is included
    in the $658.2 million above, resulting in a gain on
    extinguishment of $9.8 million, net of deferred finance
    charges. The unsecured debt repurchased by the Company matured
    in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2024 and 2035.

•

Closed on a $200 million secured credit facility. At
    December 31, 2009, $106.9 million of the amount drawn
    under the facility matures October 2019 and carries a fixed rate
    of 5.38% and $88.9 million of the amount drawn under the
    facility matures December 2019 and carries a fixed interest rate
    of 5.16%. The Company has one year from September 11, 2009
    to draw on the remaining $4.2 million of capacity.

•

Repurchased 997,738 shares of our 6.75% Series G
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $21.5 million,
    less than their liquidation value of $24.9 million.

•

Initiated an “At the Market” equity distribution
    program pursuant to which we may sell up to 15 million
    shares of common stock from time to time to or through sales
    agents, by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the
    New York Stock Exchange at prevailing market prices at the time
    of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable agent. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company sold 4,460,032 shares
    of common stock under the program at an average price per share
    of $15.48, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
    $69.1 million. Aggregate net proceeds from such sales,
    after deducting commissions paid to the sales agents of
    approximately $1.4 million and related issuance costs of
    approximately $500,000, were approximately $67.2 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, our net cash used in
    financing activities was $472.5 million compared to
    $178.1 million for the comparable period of 2007. The
    increase in financing activities was due to increased net
    payments, including debt buybacks on secured and unsecured debt;
    the repurchase of shares of our 6.75% Series G Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock; and the repurchase of shares of our
    common stock. These cash outflows were offset by the issuance of
    common equity through a public offering.

Credit
    Facilities

As of December 31, 2009, we have secured revolving credit
    facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of
    $1.4 billion with $1.2 billion outstanding. The Fannie
    Mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years,
    bear interest at floating and fixed rates, and certain variable
    rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at
    our option. We have $950.0 million of the funded balance
    fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% and the
    remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted
    average variable rate of 1.7%.

As of December 31, 2008, we had secured revolving credit
    facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of
    $1.0 billion with $831.2 million outstanding. The
    Fannie Mae credit facilities are for an initial term of
    10 years, bear interest at floating and fixed rates, and
    certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an
    additional five years at our option. We had $666.6 million
    of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate
    of 5.5% and the remaining balance on these facilities is
    currently at a weighted average variable rate of 3.1%.

On July 27, 2007, we amended and restated our existing
    three-year $500 million unsecured bank revolving credit
    facility with a maturity date of May 31, 2008 (which could
    be extended for an additional year at our option), to increase
    the facility to $600 million and to extend its maturity to
    July 26, 2012. Under



certain circumstances, we may increase the $600 million
    credit facility to $750 million. Based on our current
    credit ratings, the $600 million credit facility carries an
    interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 47.5 basis
    points, which represents a 10 basis point reduction to the
    previous $500 million revolving credit facility. Under a
    competitive bid feature and for so long as we maintain an
    investment grade rating, we have the right under the
    $600 million credit facility to bid out 50% of the
    commitment amount and we can bid out 100% of the commitment
    amount once per quarter. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    there was $189.3 million and $0, respectively, outstanding
    on the unsecured revolving credit facility.

The Fannie Mae credit facility and the bank revolving credit
    facility are subject to customary financial covenants and
    limitations.

Interest
    Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable
    rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced.
    We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other
    speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial
    instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets.
    Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in
    market interest rates and the fair value of market rate
    sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as
    changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable
    rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. We had
    $709.2 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to
    interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2009. If
    market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by
    100 basis points, our interest expense would increase by
    $6.0 million based on the average balance outstanding
    during the year.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of
    hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These
    analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of
    overall economic activity that could exist in such an
    environment. Further, in the event of a change of such
    magnitude, management would likely take actions to further
    mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the
    uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and
    their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no
    change in our financial structure.

Funds
    from Operations

Funds from operations, or FFO, is defined as net income
    (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses)
    from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate
    depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute FFO
    for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations
    set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment
    Trust’s (“NAREIT”) April 1, 2002 White
    Paper. We consider FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and
    our operating performance, and believe that FFO should be
    considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income
    and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. FFO does not represent
    cash generated from operating activities in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily
    indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance
    with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate
    assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate
    values instead have historically risen or fallen with market
    conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered
    the presentation of operating results for real estate companies
    that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by
    themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure
    of REIT operating performance and defines FFO as net income
    (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from
    sales of depreciable property, premiums or original issuance
    costs associated with preferred stock redemptions, plus
    depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The use of FFO,
    combined with the required presentations, has been fundamentally
    beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results of
    REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT
    operating results more meaningful. We generally consider FFO to
    be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and
    financial performance (although FFO



should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains
    the primary measure of performance) because by excluding gains
    or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating
    real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation
    and amortization, FFO can help one compare the operating
    performance of a Company’s real estate between periods or
    as compared to different companies. We believe that FFO is the
    best measure of economic profitability for real estate
    investment trusts.

The following table outlines our FFO calculation and
    reconciliation to GAAP for the three years ended
    December 31, 2009

Results
    of Operations

The following discussion includes the results of both continuing
    and discontinued operations for the periods presented.

Net
    (Loss)/ Income Attributable to Common Stockholders

    -vs-2008

Net loss attributable to common stockholders was
    ($95.9 million) ($0.64 per diluted share) for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 as compared to net income
    attributable to common stockholders of $688.7 million
    ($5.29 per diluted share) for the comparable period in the prior
    year. The decrease in net income available to common
    stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2009 resulted
    primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed
    in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

a reduction in disposition gains in 2009 as compared to 2008.
    The Company recognized net gains of $2.4 million and
    $786.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively;



•

an increase in our loss from unconsolidated entities, primarily
    due to the recognition of a $16.0 million non-cash charge
    representing an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of equity investments in two of our
    unconsolidated joint ventures during the quarter ended
    September 30, 2009;

•

the recognition of an income tax benefit from the Company’s
    Taxable REIT Subsidiaries, or “TRS” during 2008;

•

an increase in depreciation expense primarily due to the
    Company’s acquisition of operating properties and the
    completion of redevelopment and development communities in 2008
    and 2009;

•

a decrease in other income primarily due to a reduction in fees
    earned for both recurring and non-recurring items related to the
    Company’s joint ventures and a decrease in interest income;

•

change in net income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling
    interest of $50.2 million.

The decreases to our net income available to common stockholders
    were partially offset by a decrease in general and
    administrative expense of $7.4 million when compared to
    2008.

    -vs-2007

Net income attributable to common stockholders was
    $688.7 million ($5.29 per diluted share) for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to $199.0 million ($1.48
    per diluted share) for the comparable period in the prior year.
    The increase in net income attributable to common stockholders
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted primarily
    from the following items, all of which are discussed in further
    detail elsewhere within this Report.

•

an increase of $547.3 million in the gains on the
    disposition of our property inclusive of gains on sale to a
    joint venture;

•

a decrease of $39.0 million in total interest expense due
    in part to the Company recognizing gains of $26.3 on the
    extinguishment of certain unsecured debt instruments;

•

an increase of $16.9 million related to interest income
    generated by the Company; and

•

a gain of $3.1 million related to the repurchase of shares
    of our 6.75% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock
    at less than their liquation value

The increases to our net income attributable to common
    stockholders were offset by: a reduction in property NOI of
    $82.1 million due to our dispositions; an increase in net
    income attributable to non-controlling interest of
    $34.5 million; and an increase in general and
    administrative expense of $7.6 million when compared to
    2007.

Same
    Communities

2009-vs.-2008

Our same store communities (those acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to January 1, 2008 and held on
    December 31, 2009) consisted of 33,166 apartment homes
    and provided 76% of our total NOI for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

NOI for our same community properties decreased 2.2% or
    $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in property
    NOI was primarily attributable to a 2.0% or $8.8 million
    decrease in property rental income, which was partially offset
    by a 1.6% or $2.3 million decrease in operating expenses.
    The decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a 2.9% or
    $12.9 million decrease in rental rates which was offset by
    an 18.9% or $4.0 million decrease in vacancy loss and an
    8.6% or $1.4 million increase in reimbursement income.
    Physical occupancy slightly increased 0.6% to 95.4% and total
    income per occupied home decreased $30 to $1,149.

The decrease in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 1.3% or $568,000 decrease in real estate taxes due to
    favorable tax appeals, a 3.3% or $764,000 decrease in repairs
    and maintenance, and a 9.7% or $970,000 decrease in
    administrative and marketing costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
    net operating income divided by property rental income)
    decreased to 68.0% as compared to 68.1% in the comparable period
    in the prior year.

2008-vs.-2007

Our same store communities (those acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to January 1, 2007 and held on
    December 31, 2008) consisted of 32,124 apartment homes
    and provided 74% of our property NOI for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

NOI for our same community properties increased 3.8% or
    $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    compared to the same period in 2007. The increase in property
    NOI was primarily attributable to a 3.6%



or $14.8 million increase in rental revenues and other
    income partially offset by a 3.1% or $4.1 million increase
    in operating expenses. The increase in revenues was primarily
    driven by a 1.4% or $6.0 million increase in rental rates,
    a 13.9% or $2.0 million increase in reimbursement income,
    and a 76.9% or $4.3 million decrease in rental concessions.
    Physical occupancy increased 0.3% to 94.8% and total income per
    occupied home increased $37 to $1,176.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 5.9% or $2.3 million increase in real estate taxes due
    to higher assessed values on our communities and favorable tax
    appeals in 2007 and a 5.4% or $1.7 million increase in
    personnel costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
    net operating income divided by property rental income)
    increased to 68.3% as compared to 68.1% in the comparable period
    in the prior year.

Non-Mature
    Communities

2009-vs.-2008

The remaining $95.2 million and $88.8 million of our
    NOI during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities.” UDR’s non-mature
    communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria
    to be included in same communities, which includes communities
    developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold
    properties, properties classified as real estate held for
    disposition and condominium properties. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we recognized NOI for our developments
    of $10.5 million, acquired communities of
    $54.3 million, and redeveloped properties of
    $24.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
    we recognized NOI for our developments of $2.4 million,
    acquired communities of $38.2 million, redeveloped
    properties of $22.1 million and sold properties of
    $23.5 million.

2008-vs.-2007

The remaining $103.6 million and $196.5 million of our
    NOI during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities.” For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we recognized NOI for our developments
    of $7.5 million, acquired communities of
    $46.0 million, redeveloped properties of $19.2 million
    and sold properties of $25.0 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we recognized net operating income for
    our developments of $4.0 million, acquired communities of
    $6.6 million, redeveloped properties of $14.9 million
    and sold properties of $146.1 million. In addition, in 2007
    the Company sold a portfolio of properties into a joint venture
    that we continue to manage after the transaction and as such is
    not deemed discontinued operations. The NOI from those
    communities was $18.3 million.

Other
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2009, significant amounts
    reflected in other income include: interest income and discount
    amortization from an interest in a convertible debt security,
    and fees earned for both recurring and non-recurring items
    related to the Company’s joint ventures. For the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, other income also
    included interest income from a note for $200 million that
    the Company received related to the disposition of 86 properties
    during 2008. In May 2009, the $200 million note was paid in
    full. For the year ended December 31, 2008, interest income
    also included interest from uninvested 1031 proceeds. The
    Company had redeployed all 1031 proceeds by December 31,
    2008.

Tax
    Benefit for TRS

UDR elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated
    as TRS. Income taxes for our TRS are accounted for under the
    asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to
    differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
    existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using



enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
    years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
    recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings
    in the period of the enactment date. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we recognized tax expense to the extent
    of cash taxes paid. For the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, we recognized a benefit due to the results of
    operations and temporary differences associated with the TRS.

Other
    Operating Expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the increases in
    other operating expenses are primarily due to additional costs
    incurred by the Company related to long-term ground leases
    associated with properties acquired in December 2007 and July
    2008. A schedule of future obligations related to ground leases
    is set forth under “Contractual Obligations” below.

Real
    Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2009, real estate
    depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
    discontinued operations increased 10.5% or $26.4 million as
    compared to the comparable period in 2008. The increase in
    depreciation and amortization for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 is primarily the result of the
    Company’s acquisition of 13 communities with 4,558
    apartment homes during 2008, development completions during 2009
    and 2008, and additional capital expenditures. As part of the
    Company’s acquisition activity a portion of the purchase
    price is allocated to intangible assets and are typically
    amortized over a period of less than one year.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, real estate
    depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
    discontinued operations decreased 2.1% or $5.5 million as
    compared to the comparable period in 2007. The decrease in
    depreciation and amortization for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 is a result of the Company’s
    repositioning efforts that included the sale of 86 operating
    communities. As the properties sold in 2008 did not meet the
    criteria to be deemed as

held-for-sale

the communities until late in the fourth quarter of 2007, we did
    not cease depreciation until that time. With the proceeds from
    the sale, the Company purchased $1.0 billion of properties.
    As part of our allocation of fair value associated with the
    purchase price, we attributed $14.0 million to in-place
    leases for our multi-family communities, which are generally
    amortized over an 11 month period. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company recorded $3.7 million
    of depreciation related to two properties that we had previously
    been marketing as condominiums and classified as

held-for-sale

when we determined it prudent to operate these as rental
    properties.

Interest
    Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 2.4% or
    $3.5 million as compared to 2008. This decrease is
    primarily due to the Company’s debt repurchase activity
    during 2008 and 2009. During 2009, we recognized a gain of
    $9.8 million as a result of repurchasing unsecured debt
    securities with a notional amount of $238.9 million in the
    open market throughout the year. The gains were partially offset
    by $3.8 million of expenses related to the tender of
    $37.5 million of unsecured debt and $2.6 million for
    prepayment penalties and the write-off of the fair market value
    adjustment for consolidated joint venture debt. In addition, the
    weighted average interest rate decreased from 4.9% in 2008 to
    4.5% in 2009, which further reduced our interest expense. The
    decrease in the weighted average interest rate during 2009
    reflects short-term bank borrowings and variable rate debt that
    had lower interest rates in 2009 when compared to the same
    period in 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 21.1% or
    $39.0 million as compared to 2007. This decrease is
    primarily due to the Company recognizing a gain of
    $26.3 million on debt extinguishment that was partially
    offset by a $4.2 million prepayment penalty incurred by the
    Company in refinancing a secured debt instrument in 2008. The
    gain on debt extinguishment was a result of the Company
    repurchasing unsecured debt securities with a notional amount of
    $207.7 million in the open market throughout the year. In
    addition, the weighted average interest rate decreased from 5.3%
    in 2007 to 4.9% in 2008, which further reduced our interest
    expense. The decrease



in the weighted average interest rate during 2008 reflects
    short-term bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had lower
    interest rates in 2008 when compared to the same period in 2007.

General
    and Administrative

For the year ended December 31, 2009, general and
    administrative expenses decreased 15.6% or $7.4 million as
    compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the one-time
    charges during 2008 listed below.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, general and
    administrative expenses increased 19.2% or $7.6 million as
    compared to 2007. The increase was due to a number of factors,
    including the Company writing off acquisition-related costs, the
    Company no longer pursuing a condominium strategy resulted in
    writing off $1.7 million in deferred sales charges, the
    renegotiation

and/or

cancellation of certain operating leases

and/or

vendor contracts of $0.8 million, the Company cancelling a
    contract to acquire a pre-sale property resulting in a charge of
    $1.7 million and the Company acquiring certain contractual
    rights related to a joint venture resulted in the Company
    incurring a charge of $305,000 for the profit component of the
    contracts.

Severance
    Costs and Other Restructuring Charges

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recognized $653,000 of severance and restructuring charges as
    the Company continued to consolidate our operations in Highlands
    Ranch, Colorado. In addition, we announced reductions to certain
    positions related to both operations and corporate staff.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, UDR recognized
    $4.3 million in severance costs and other restructuring
    charges partly as a result of our disposition of 86 communities
    consisting of 25,684 apartment homes. As a result of a
    comprehensive review of the organizational structure of UDR and
    its operations, UDR recorded a charge of $3.6 million
    during the fourth quarter of 2007 related to workforce
    reductions, relocation costs, and other related costs. These
    charges are included in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations within the line item “Severance costs and other
    restructuring charges.” All charges were approved by
    management and our Board of Directors in October 2007. The
    Company had a zero balance related to the 2007 charges as of
    December 31, 2008.

Gains on
    the Sale of Land and Depreciable Property

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we
    recognized after-tax gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $2.4 million, $786.4 million, and $239.1 million,
    respectively. Changes in the level of gains recognized from
    period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture
    activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains
    related to specific properties sold.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation
    primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities
    and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a
    term of one year or less, which generally enables us to
    compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on
    our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in energy
    and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and
    their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this
    has had a material impact on our results for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that
    have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future
    effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
    condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations,
    liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
    material.

For purposes of our ground lease
    contracts, the Company uses the minimum lease payment, if stated
    in the agreement. For ground lease agreements where there is a
    reset provision based on the communities appraised value or
    consumer price index but does not included a specified minimum
    lease payment, the Company uses the current rent over the
    remainder of the lease term.

During 2009, we incurred gross interest costs of
    $159.3 million, of which $16.9 million was capitalized.

Factors
    Affecting Our Business and Prospects

There are many factors that affect our business and the results
    of our operations, some of which are beyond our control. These
    factors include:

•

general economic factors;

•

unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions
    that could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates;

•

the failure of acquisitions to achieve anticipated results;

•

possible difficulty in selling apartment communities;

•

competitive factors that may limit our ability to lease
    apartment homes or increase or maintain rents;

•

insufficient cash flow that could affect our debt financing and
    create refinancing risk;

•

failure to generate sufficient revenue, which could impair our
    debt service payments and distributions to stockholders;

•

development and construction risks that may impact our
    profitability;

•

potential damage from natural disasters, including hurricanes
    and other weather-related events, which could result in
    substantial costs to us;

•

risks from extraordinary losses for which we may not have
    insurance or adequate reserves;

•

uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insurance
    retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess
    of applicable coverage;

•

delays in completing developments and

lease-ups

on
    schedule;

•

our failure to succeed in new markets;

•

changing interest rates, which could increase interest costs and
    affect the market price of our securities;



•

potential liability for environmental contamination, which could
    result in substantial costs to us;

•

the imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a REIT
    under the Code in any taxable year;

•

our internal control over financial reporting may not be
    considered effective which could result in a loss of investor
    confidence in our financial reports, and in turn have an adverse
    effect on our stock price; and

•

changes in real estate laws, tax laws and other laws affecting
    our business.

A discussion of these and other factors affecting our business
    and prospects is set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk
    Factors. We encourage investors to review these risk factors.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2009, we carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures
    are designed with the objective of ensuring that information
    required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
    alerting them to material information required to be included in
    our periodic SEC reports.

It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is
    based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
    future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
    will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
    future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective under
    circumstances where our disclosure controls and procedures
    should reasonably be expected to operate effectively.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

UDR’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, our Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations (COSO).

Based on UDR’s evaluation, management concluded that our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2009.



Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Report, has audited UDR’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. The report of Ernst & Young
    LLP, which expresses an unqualified opinion on UDR’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, is included under the heading
    “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of
    Directors and Stockholders of

UDR, Inc.

We have audited UDR, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). UDR, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, UDR, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of UDR, Inc. as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009 of UDR, Inc. and our report dated
    February 25, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

UDR, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    UDR, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009
    and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of UDR, Inc. at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Staff Position No. APB 14 — 1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)

(“FSP APB 14 — 1”) (codified
    in FASB ASC Topic 470, Debt with Conversions and Other Options);
    SFAS No. 160,

Non-controlling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(“SFAS 160”) (codified in FASB ASC Topic 810,
    Consolidation); and EITF 09-E,

Accounting for
    Distributions to Shareholders with Components of Stock and Cash

(“EITF 09-E”) (codified in ASU

2010-01,

Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components of
    Stock and Cash) and retrospectively adjusted its accounting for
    its consolidated financial statements for all periods presented
    herein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), UDR,
    Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 25, 2010 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2009

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization,
    formation and special dividend

UDR, Inc. (“UDR”, the “Company”
    “we” or “our”) is a self-administered real
    estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires,
    renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities generally
    in high

barrier-to-entry

markets located in the United States. The high

barrier-to-entry

markets are characterized by limited land for new construction,
    difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive
    single-family home prices and significant employment growth
    potential. At December 31, 2009, our apartment portfolio
    consisted of 165 consolidated communities located in 23 markets
    consisting of 45,913 apartment homes. In addition, the Company
    has an ownership interest in 3,992 apartment units through
    unconsolidated joint ventures.

On November 5, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend of $1.29 per share (“the Special Dividend”)
    payable to holders of our common stock. The dividend was paid on
    January 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on
    December 9, 2008. The dividend represented the
    Company’s 2008 fourth quarter recurring distribution of
    $0.33 per share and an additional special distribution in the
    amount of $0.96 per share due to taxable income arising from our
    disposition activity occurring during the year. Subject to the
    Company’s right to pay the entire dividend in cash,
    stockholders had the option to make an election to receive
    payment in cash or in shares, however, the aggregate amount of
    cash payable to stockholders, other than cash payable in lieu of
    fractional shares, would not be less than $44.0 million.

The Special Dividend, totaling $177.1 million was paid on
    137,266,557 shares issued and outstanding on the record
    date. Approximately $133.1 million of the Special Dividend
    was paid through the issuance of 11,358,042 shares of
    common stock, which was determined based on the volume weighted
    average closing sales price of our common stock of $11.71 per
    share on the NYSE on January 21, 2009 and January 22,
    2009. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board’s (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
    Update

2010-01,

Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components
    of Stock and Cash

(“ASU

2010-01”),

which considers distributions that contain components of cash
    and stock and allows shareholders to select their preferred form
    of distribution. Such a distribution, to the extent paid in
    stock. is now treated as a stock issuance on the date the
    dividend is paid. At December 31, 2008, the Company accrued
    $133.1 million of distribution payable related to the
    Special Dividend. ASU

2010-01

is
    effective for the Company on December 15, 2009 and was
    applied on a retrospective basis. As a result, the Company
    reversed the effect of the issuance of additional shares of
    common stock pursuant to the Special Dividend, which was
    retroactively reflected in each of the historical periods
    presented within the Company’s

Form 8-K

filed with the SEC on May 22, 2009, and effectively issued
    these shares on January 29, 2009 (the payment date of the
    Special Dividend). For the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, basic and diluted net income attributable to common
    stockholders per weighted average common share prior to
    retrospective adjustment was $4.89 and $1.37, respectively. This
    was based on weighted average common shares of 140,982,000 and
    145,092,000 (basic and diluted), for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Basis of
    presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of UDR and
    its wholly-owned subsidiaries includes certain joint ventures,
    which the Company previously accounted for as investments under
    the equity method (see Note 4, “Joint Ventures”,
    for further discussion). All significant intercompany accounts
    and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company’s subsidiaries include United Dominion Realty,
    L.P., (the “Operating Partnership”), and Heritage
    Communities L.P. (the “Heritage OP”). As of
    December 31, 2009, there were 179,863,065 units in the
    Operating Partnership outstanding, of which
    173,876,477 units or 96.7% were owned by UDR and
    5,986,588 units or 3.3% were owned by limited partners. As
    of December 31, 2009, there were 6,264,460 units



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in the Heritage OP outstanding, of which 100% were owned by UDR.
    The Consolidated Financial Statements of UDR include the
    non-controlling interests of the unitholders in the Operating
    Partnership and the Heritage OP.

The Company evaluated subsequent events through
    February 25, 2010, the date of issuance of the
    Company’s financial statements. No recognized or
    non-recognized subsequent events were noted.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standard (“SFAS”) No. 168, “The FASB
    Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles — a replacement of FASB
    Statement No. 162” (“SFAS 168”).
    Effective for our financial statements issued for interim and
    annual periods commencing with the quarterly period ended
    September 30, 2009, the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (“Codification” or “ASC”) is
    the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the
    FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and
    interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal
    securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC
    registrants. The Codification supersedes all then-existing,
    non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. In the FASB’s
    view, the Codification does not change GAAP, and therefore the
    adoption of SFAS 168, now referred to as FASB ASC 105,

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

, did not have an
    effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows. However, where we have referred to
    specific authoritative accounting literature, both the
    Codification and pre-Codification GAAP literature are disclosed.

FASB ASC 810,

Consolidation

(formerly SFAS 160,
    “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements- an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin 51
    (“Consolidated Financial Statements”)”
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    non-controlling (minority) interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
    non-controlling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as
    equity in the consolidated financial statements. Consolidated
    net income should include the net income for both the parent and
    the non-controlling interest with disclosure of both amounts on
    the consolidated statement of operations. The calculation of
    earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts
    attributable to the parent. The Company adopted this standard,
    effective January 1, 2009. As a result, loss from
    continuing operations attributable to common stockholders per
    diluted share decreased by $0.39 and $0.07 for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively and income from
    discontinued operations per diluted share increased by the same
    amounts. There was no impact to net (loss)/income attributable
    to common stockholders per diluted share due to the adoption of
    this standard. As part of our adoption of this standard, we have
    retroactively adopted the measurement provisions of FASB ASC
    480,

Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity

(formerly
    EITF Topic D-98, “Classification and Measurement of
    Redeemable Securities”). Upon adoption, we adjusted the
    carrying amount of the operating partnership units by
    recognizing an $86.8 million increase to “Redeemable
    non-controlling interest in operating partnership” on the
    balance sheet and a corresponding decrease in
    “Distributions in Excess of Net Income,” which was
    accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment as of
    January 1, 2006.

FASB ASC

470-20,

Debt with Conversion and Other Options

(formerly FASB
    Staff Position APB

14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion”) (“Subtopic

470-20”)

requires entities that issued certain convertible debt
    instruments that may be settled or partially settled in cash on
    conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and
    equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a
    manner that reflects the entity’s nonconvertible debt
    borrowing rate. This standard requires that an entity determine
    the estimated fair value of a similar debt instrument as of the
    date of the issuance without the conversion feature but
    inclusive of any other embedded features such as puts and calls
    and assign that value to the debt component of the instrument,
    which would result in a discount being recorded. The debt is
    subsequently accreted to its par value over its expected life
    using the market rate at the date of issuance. The residual
    value between the initial proceeds and the value allocated to
    the debt would be

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reflected in equity as additional paid in capital. The Company
    adopted this standard, effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008 and retrospectively applied it to
    both new and existing convertible instruments. Accordingly, the
    Company recognized a decrease in “Distributions in Excess
    of Net Income” of $117,000 on January 1, 2006 for the
    cumulative change in interest expense. We also recorded a
    $32.6 million increase to “Additional Paid in
    Capital” for the allocation of the equity component. The
    Company recognized an additional $7.6 million ($0.05 per
    diluted share), $9.9 million ($0.08 per diluted share), and
    $6.7 million ($0.05 per diluted share) of interest expense
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively due to the adoption of this standard. This impact
    includes both regular amortization of convertible debt premium
    and the effect of write offs due to convertible debt repurchases.

FASB ASC 260,

Earnings per Share

(formerly FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions are Participating Securities”) was
    effective January 1, 2009 and has been applied
    retrospectively. This standard clarifies that unvested
    share-based payment awards that participate in dividends similar
    to shares of common stock or operating partnership units should
    be treated as participating securities. It also affects the
    computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for unvested
    restricted stock awards which entitle the holders to dividends.
    The standard did not affect earnings per share amounts for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 because we reported a net loss
    for the period and accordingly had no undistributed earnings.
    This standard had an immaterial affect on the earnings per share
    amount for the year ended December 31, 2009. We do not
    expect it to have a material effect on future earnings per share
    amounts.

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(formerly SFAS 157, “Fair Value Instruments”

No. FAS 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”)
    (“Topic 820”) defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurement. Topic 820
    applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or
    permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair
    value measurements. The adoption of Topic 820 for financial
    assets and liabilities, as of January 1, 2008, did not have
    a material impact on our financial position or operations. Topic
    820 delayed the effective date of Topic 820’s fair value
    measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities
    that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value
    on a recurring basis. Fair value measurements identified in
    Topic 820 was effective for our fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2009 and did not have an impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

FASB ASC 805,

Business Combinations

(formerly
    SFAS 141R, “Business Combinations”) became
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. This standard establishes principles and requirements for
    how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its
    financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
    liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the
    acquiree. This standard also provides guidance for recognizing
    and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination,
    recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from
    contingencies, and determining what information to disclose to
    enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature
    and financial effects of the business combination. The adoption
    of this guidance could materially impact our future consolidated
    financial position and results of operations depending on the
    Company’s acquisition activity as certain acquisition costs
    that have historically been capitalized as part of the basis of
    the real estate and amortized over the real estate’s useful
    life will now be expensed as incurred. This guidance did not
    have a material impact on our financial statements during the
    year ended December 31, 2009.

    enhance the financial statement user’s understanding of:
    (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments,
    (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under Topic 815 and its related interpretations,
    and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    affect an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance, and cash flows. The standard

did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows. However, it requires
    qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for
    using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about the fair value
    of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and
    disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in
    derivative instruments. See Note 9,

Derivative and
    Hedging Activity,

for these additional disclosures.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 167, “Amendments to
    FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (“SFAS 167”),
    which (1) addresses the effects of eliminating the
    qualifying special-purpose entity concept from ASC 860,

Transfers and Servicing

(formerly SFAS 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities”), and (2) responds
    to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of
    ASC 810,

Consolidation

(formerly FASB Interpretation
    No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities”), including concerns over the transparency of
    enterprises’ involvement with variable interest entities
    (“VIEs”). SFAS 167 is effective beginning on
    January 1, 2010. The Company does not expect a material
    impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows as a result of the new guidance.

In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
    (ASU)

No. 2009-05,

“Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value” (“ASU

2009-05”),

which provides amendments to Topic 820. ASU

2009-05

provides additional guidance clarifying the measurement of
    liabilities at fair value. ASU

2009-05

was
    effective in the fourth quarter 2009 for a calendar year entity.
    This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows during
    the year ended December 31, 2009.

Investment
    in joint ventures

We use the equity method to account for investments that qualify
    as variable interest entities where we are not the primary
    beneficiary and entities that we do not control or where we do
    not own a majority of the economic interest but have the ability
    to exercise significant influence over the operating and
    financial policies of the investee. Throughout these financial
    statements we use the term “joint venture” when
    referring to entities in which we do not have a 100% ownership
    interest. The Company will also use the equity method when we
    function as the managing member and our joint venture partner
    has substantive participating rights or where we can be replaced
    by our joint venture partner as managing member without cause.
    For a joint venture accounted for under the equity method, our
    share of net earnings or losses is reflected as income when
    earned and distributions are credited against our investment in
    the joint venture as received.

In determining whether a joint venture is a variable interest
    entity, the Company considers: the form of our ownership
    interest and legal structure; the size of our investment; the
    financing structure of the entity, including necessity of
    subordinated debt; estimates of future cash flows; ours and our
    partner’s ability to participate in the decision making
    related to acquisitions, disposition, budgeting and financing of
    the entity; obligation to absorb losses and preferential
    returns; nature of our partner’s primary operations; and
    the degree, if any, of disproportionally between the economic
    and voting interests of the entity. As of December 31,
    2009, the Company did not assess any of our joint ventures as
    variable interest entities where UDR was the primary beneficiary.

In accordance with FASB ASC

323-10,

Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures

(formerly
    APB Opinion 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for
    Investments in Common Stock”) (“Subtopic

323-10”),

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint
    ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    there may be an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a
    decrease in the value of the investment is

other-than-temporary.

These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the
    venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the
    entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the
    entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture
    partners and its lenders. The amount of loss recognized is the
    excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its
    estimated fair value. If we believe that the decline in fair
    value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. The
    aforementioned



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the
    valuation of our investment property. Should the actual results
    differ from management’s judgment, the valuation could be
    negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
    disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the
    financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid
    could differ from those estimates. Certain previously reported
    amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
    financial statement presentation.

Discontinued
    operations

For properties accounted for under FASB ASC 360,

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

(formerly

SFAS

144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets”) (“Topic 360”), the results of operations
    for those properties sold during the year or classified as

held-for-sale

at the end of the current year are classified as discontinued
    operations in the current and prior periods. Further, to meet
    the discontinued operations criteria, the Company will not have
    any significant continuing involvement in the ownership or
    operation of the property after the sale or disposition. Once a
    property is deemed as

held-for-sale,

depreciation is no longer recorded. However, if the Company
    determines that the property no longer meets the criteria for

held-for-sale,

the Company will recapture any unrecorded depreciation on the
    property. The sales related to condominium units are also
    included in discontinued operations (see Note 3,
    “Discontinued Operations” for further discussion).

Real
    estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical
    cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements, furniture,
    fixtures and equipment and other costs incurred during their
    development, acquisition and redevelopment.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are
    charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements,
    renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition

and/or

improvement of real estate assets are capitalized and
    depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the
    expenditures qualify as a betterment or the life of the related
    asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life
    expectancy.

UDR purchases real estate investment properties and allocates
    the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired based on their estimated fair value. The
    primary, although not only, identifiable intangible asset
    associated with our portfolio is the value of existing lease
    agreements. When allocating cost to an acquired community, we
    first allocate costs to the estimated intangible value of the
    existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the
    land, building and fixtures assuming the community is vacant.
    The Company estimates the intangible value of the lease
    agreements by determining the lost revenue associated with a
    hypothetical

lease-up.

Depreciation on the building is based on the expected useful
    life of the asset and the in-place leases are amortized over
    their remaining contractual life.

Quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant, UDR will
    assess our real estate portfolio for indicators of impairment.
    In determining whether the Company has indicators of impairment
    in our real estate assets, we assess whether the long-lived
    asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s
    undiscounted future cash flows, which is representative of
    projected NOI plus the residual value of the community. Our
    future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results
    adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and
    operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. If such
    indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value
    exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community, an
    impairment loss is recognized equal



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its
    estimated fair value. Our estimates of fair market value
    represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and
    reference to market rates and transactions.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are
    recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost
    to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition generally
    represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted
    for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next
    twelve months. Real estate held for disposition is carried at
    the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair
    value, less the cost to dispose, determined on an

asset-by-asset

basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on
    held for disposition properties are charged to expense as
    incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and
    replacements related to held for disposition properties are
    capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate
    held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets which are
    35 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major
    improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures,
    equipment, and other assets. As of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the value of our net intangible assets which are reflected
    in “Other assets” was $7.3 million and
    $10.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009
    and 2008, the value of our net intangible liabilities which are
    reflected in “Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other
    liabilities” was $5.2 million and $7.1 million in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balances are being
    amortized over the remaining life of the respective intangible.

All development projects and related carrying costs are
    capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
    “Real estate under development.” As each building in a
    project is completed and becomes available for

lease-up,

the total cost of the building is transferred to real estate
    held for investment and the assets are depreciated over their
    estimated useful lives. The costs of development projects which
    include interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated
    development overhead related to support costs for personnel
    working directly on the development site are capitalized during
    the construction period. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, total
    interest capitalized was $16.9 million, $14.9 million,
    and $13.2 million, respectively.

Cash and
    cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand
    deposits with financial institutions and short-term, highly
    liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid investments
    with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. The majority of the Company’s cash and
    cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks.

Restricted
    cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for
    real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and
    security deposits.

Escrow —
    1031 exchange funds

In most cases, disposition proceeds are set aside and designated
    to fund future tax-deferred exchanges of qualifying real estate
    investments. If these proceeds are not redeployed to qualifying
    real estate investment within 180 days, these funds are
    redesignated as cash and cash equivalents.

Derivative
    financial instruments

The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage
    interest rate risk and will generally designate these financial
    instruments as a cash flow hedge. Derivative financial
    instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as
    either an asset or liability and measured quarterly at their
    fair value. The changes in fair value for cash flow hedges that
    are deemed effective are reflected in other comprehensive

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

income and for non-designated derivative financial instruments
    in earnings. For cash flow hedges the ineffective component, if
    any, is recorded in earnings.

Cost of
    raising capital

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of equity
    securities are deducted from stockholders equity. Costs incurred
    in connection with the issuance or renewal of debt are subject
    to the provisions of FASB ASC

470-50,

Debt Modification and Extinguishment

(formerly

EITF 96-19,

“Debtors’ Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments”). Accordingly, if the terms of the
    renewed or modified debt instrument are deemed to be
    substantially different (i.e. a 10 percent or greater
    difference in the cash flows between instruments), all
    unamortized financing costs associated with the extinguished
    debt are charged to earnings in the current period. When the
    cash flows are not substantially different, the costs associated
    with the renewal or modification are capitalized and amortized
    into interest expense over the term of the related debt
    instrument. The balance of any unamortized financing costs
    associated with retired debt is expensed upon retirement.
    Deferred financing costs for new debt instruments include fees
    and costs incurred by the Company to obtain financing. Deferred
    financing costs are generally amortized on a straight-line
    basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over a
    period not to exceed the term of the related debt.

Preferred
    share repurchases

When repurchasing preferred stock, the Company recognizes share
    issuance costs as a charge to the preferred stock on a pro rata
    basis to the total costs incurred for the preferred stock
    offering. The Company, during the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, recognized share issuance costs of
    $853,000, $829,000 and $2.3 million, respectively as part
    of the amount reported in “Discount/(premium) on preferred
    stock repurchases, net” in the Consolidated Statement of
    Stockholders Equity.

Comprehensive
    income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in equity
    during each period except for those resulting from investments
    by or distributions to stockholders, is displayed in the
    accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
    Equity and Comprehensive Income. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, other comprehensive income consisted of
    the change in fair value of marketable securities, the change in
    the fair value of effective cash flow hedges from our
    consolidated subsidiaries and our proportionate percentage of
    previously unconsolidated joint ventures in which UDR has
    elected to utilize hedge accounting. (See Note 4,
    “Joint Ventures” for further discussion.)

Revenue
    and real estate sales gain recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual
    basis when due from residents in accordance with FASB ASC 840,

Leases

(formerly SFAS 13 “Accounting for
    Leases”) and SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition”.
    Rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis and
    recognized when earned. The Company recognizes interest income,
    management and other fees and incentives when earned, fixed and
    determinable.

The Company accounts for sales of real estate in accordance with
    FASB ASC

360-20,

Real Estate Sales

(formerly SFAS 66,
    “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”). For sale
    transactions meeting the requirements for full accrual profit
    recognition, such as the Company no longer having continuing
    involvement in the property, we remove the related assets and
    liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record the
    gain or loss in the period the transaction closes. For sale
    transactions that do not meet the full accrual sale criteria due
    to our continuing involvement, we evaluate the nature of the
    continuing involvement and account for the transaction under an
    alternate method of accounting.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Sales to entities in which we retain or otherwise own an
    interest are accounted for as partial sales. If all other
    requirements for recognizing profit under the full accrual
    method have been satisfied and no other forms of continuing
    involvement are present, we recognize profit proportionate to
    the outside interest in the buyer and will defer the gain on the
    interest we retain. The Company will recognize any deferred gain
    when the property is then sold to a third party. In transactions
    accounted by us as partial sales, we determine if the buyer of
    the majority equity interest in the venture was provided a
    preference as to cash flows in either an operating or a capital
    waterfall. If a cash flow preference has been provided, we
    recognize profit only to the extent that proceeds from the sale
    of the majority equity interest exceed costs related to the
    entire property.

Advertising
    costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item
    “Administrative and marketing”. During 2009, 2008, and
    2007, total advertising expense was $5.7 million,
    $6.1 million, and $7.8 million, respectively.

Stock-based
    employee compensation plans

UDR accounts for its stock-based employee compensation plans in
    accordance with FASB ASC 718,

Compensation- Stock
    Compensation

(formerly SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based
    Payments”). This standard requires an entity to measure the
    cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
    an equity instrument based on the award’s fair value on the
    grant date and recognize the cost over the period during which
    the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the
    award, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value for
    stock options issued by the Company is calculated utilizing the
    Black-Scholes-Merton formula. For performance based awards, the
    Company remeasures the fair value each balance sheet date with
    adjustment made on a cumulative basis until the award is settled
    and the final compensation is known.

Non-controlling
    interests of unitholders in operating partnerships

Interests in operating partnerships held by limited partners are
    represented by operating partnership units
    (“OP Units”). The income is allocated to holders
    of OP Units based upon net income available to common
    stockholders and the weighted average number of OP Units
    outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units
    outstanding during the period. Capital contributions,
    distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to
    non-controlling interests in accordance with the terms of the
    individual partnership agreements. Operating Partnership units
    can be exchanged for cash or shares of UDR’s common stock
    on a

one-for-one

basis, at the option of UDR. Heritage OP units can be exchanged
    for cash or shares of UDR’s common stock on a 1.575 for one
    basis, at the option of UDR. During 2009, all Heritage OP units
    were redeemed and converted into 292,660 shares of common
    stock.

Earnings
    per share

Basic earnings per common share is computed based upon the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based upon
    common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive stock
    options and other potentially dilutive common stock equivalents.
    The dilutive effect of OP units, stock options and other
    potentially dilutive common stock equivalents is determined
    using the treasury stock method based on UDR’s average
    stock price. The number of shares used to compute basic and
    dilutive earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the
    Special Dividend during the year ended December 31, 2009.

The effect of the conversion of the operating partnership units,
    stock options, restricted stock, convertible preferred stock,
    and convertible debt, is not dilutive and is therefore not
    included in the above calculations.

If the operating partnership units were converted to common
    stock, the additional shares of common stock outstanding for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 would be
    6,705,624; 8,751,367; and 7,762,070 weighted average common
    shares, respectively.

The measurement period of the Series E Out-Performance
    Program ended on December 31, 2009, and no Series E
    Out-Performance Partnership Shares were issued. Accordingly, no
    additional operating partnership units were issued at that date
    (see Note 12, “

Commitments and
    Contingencies”

, for discussion of UDR’s
    Outperformance Programs).

If the convertible preferred stock were converted to common
    stock, the additional shares of common stock outstanding would
    be 3,035,548 for the year ended December 31, 2009, and
    2,803,812 weighted average common shares for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007.

If the stock options and unvested restricted stock were
    converted to common stock, the additional weighted average
    common shares outstanding for the three years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 would be 729,592;
    1,129,907; and 1,038,446 weighted average common shares,
    respectively.

Income
    taxes

UDR is operated as, and elects to be taxed as a REIT. Generally,
    a REIT complies with the provisions of the Code if it meets
    certain requirements concerning its income and assets, as well
    as if it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to
    its stockholders and will not be subject to U.S. federal
    income taxes if it distributes at least 100% of its income.
    Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes
    of the REIT. UDR is subject to certain state and local excise or
    franchise taxes, for which provision has been made. If we fail
    to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, our taxable income
    will be subject to United States Federal income tax at regular
    corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum
    tax). Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain
    state and local income taxes and to United States Federal income
    tax. We also will be required to pay a 100% tax on non-arms
    length transactions between us and a taxable REIT subsidiary and
    on any net income from sales of property that the IRS
    successfully asserts was property held for sale to customers in
    the ordinary course.

UDR elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated
    as Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (“TRS”) relating to the
    Company’s development activities. Income taxes for our TRS
    are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
    tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax
    consequences attributable

to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
    of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
    basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
    enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
    years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
    recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings
    in the period of the enactment date.

Approximately 12.7% and 11.2% of our apartment communities are
    located in Orange County, California and Metropolitan DC,
    respectively, based on the carrying value of our real estate
    portfolio as of December 31, 2009. Therefore, the Company
    is subject to increased exposure (positive or negative) from
    economic and other competitive factors specific to those markets.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    acquired one community with 289 units in Dallas, Texas. The
    purchase relates to a pre-sale agreement previously entered into
    by UDR, which contain provisions that will require the Company
    and the builder to jointly agree upon the fair market value of
    each property at a later point in time (generally within two
    years of stabilization). A percentage of the increase in the
    fair market value over cost will then be paid to the developer,
    ranging from 50% to 70%, which is not included in the initial
    purchase price of $28.5 million nor is the contingent
    obligation accrued for by the Company.

The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to land;
    building and improvements; furniture, fixtures and equipment;
    and intangible assets based on preliminary estimates and are
    subject to change as we obtain more complete information.

held for disposition generally represent properties that are
    actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing
    expected to occur within the next twelve months. The application
    of Topic 360 does not have an impact on net income available to
    common stockholders. The application of Topic 360 results in the
    reclassification of the operating results of all properties sold
    or classified as held for disposition through December 31,
    2009, within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, and the
    reclassification of the assets and liabilities within the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, if applicable.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company did not
    dispose of any communities. At December 31, 2009, UDR did
    not have any assets that met the criteria to be included in
    discontinued operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, UDR sold 86
    communities, one commercial property, one parcel of land, and 53
    condominiums from two communities with a total of 640
    condominiums. UDR recognized after-tax gains for financial
    reporting purposes of $786.4 million on these sales. At
    December 31, 2008, UDR did not have any assets that met the
    criteria to be included in discontinued operations. In
    conjunction with the sale of the 86 communities during 2008, UDR
    received a $200.0 million note. The Company received full
    payment of the note during the year ended December 31, 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, UDR sold 21
    communities, 61 condominiums from two communities with a total
    of 640 condominiums, and one parcel of land. UDR recognized
    after-tax gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $239.1 million on these sales, of which $125.3 million
    are included in discontinued operations. The remaining
    $113.8 million of gains recognized, related to the sale of
    nine additional communities and the contribution of one
    development property, at cost, to a joint venture in which UDR
    holds a 20% interest, and is reported as a component of
    continuing operations as disclosed in Note 4, “Joint
    Ventures”. At December 31, 2007, UDR had 86
    communities with a net book value of $885.5 million, two
    communities with a total of 579 condominiums and a net book
    value of $40.8 million, and one commercial unit with a net
    book value of $0.4 million included in real estate held for
    disposition. The results of operations for these properties and
    the interest expense associated with the secured debt on these
    properties are classified on the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations in the line item entitled “Income from

The Company in the fourth quarter of 2008 made the strategic
    decision to exit our activity related to the conversion and sale
    of condominium units. As a result of our decision, the Company
    incurred a charge to earnings of $1.7 million. The unsold
    units were reverted to operating apartment homes. In addition,
    as the Company reverted the former condominium properties to
    operating communities and removed operating results from
    discontinued operations to continuing operations. Previously
    unrecorded depreciation of $3.7 million was recorded during
    the year ended December 31, 2008.

JOINT
    VENTURES

UDR has entered into joint ventures with unrelated third parties
    for real estate assets that are either consolidated and included
    in real estate owned on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or are
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which are
    not consolidated and are included in investment in
    unconsolidated joint ventures on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. The Company consolidates an entity in which we own less
    than 100% but control the joint venture as well as any variable
    interest entity where we are the primary beneficiary. In
    addition, the Company consolidates any joint venture in which we
    are the general partner or managing member and the third party
    does not have the ability to substantively participate in the
    decision-making process nor do they have the ability to remove
    us as general partner or managing member, without cause.

UDR’s joint ventures are funded with a combination of debt
    and equity. Our losses are limited to our investment and the
    Company does not guarantee any debt (issued by our
    unconsolidated joint ventures), capital payout or other
    obligations associated with our joint venture portfolio. The
    Company guarantees 100% of debt issued by our consolidated joint
    venture for which our equity ownership percentage is expected to
    increase to 98% in the first quarter of 2010.

Consolidated
    Joint Ventures

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“989 Elements”) which owns and operates a
    23-story, 166 home high-rise apartment community in the central
    business district of Bellevue, Washington. At closing, UDR owned
    49% of the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $11.8 million. On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into
    an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49% interest in
    989 Elements for $7.8 million (outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). At closing of the agreement, the
    Company’s interest will be 98%. Concurrently, our partner
    resigned as managing member and appointed UDR as managing
    member. In addition, our partner relinquished its voting rights
    and approval rights and its ability to substantively participate
    in the decision-making process of the joint venture. As a result
    of UDR’s appointment as managing member, the Company is
    required to consolidate the joint venture under Topic 810. This
    event required UDR’s pre-existing interest in the joint
    venture, the acquired assets and the assumed liabilities to be
    remeasured at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC,

Business Combinations

(“Topic 805”). Prior to
    consolidation, our equity investment in 989 Elements was
    $9.8 million and $10.4 million at December 30,
    2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The fair value of
    the assets acquired was $55.0 million ($54.8 million
    of real estate owned and $200,000 of working capital assets) and
    the fair value of assumed liabilities was $34.1 million
    ($33.4 million of a construction loan and $700,000 of
    working capital liabilities) at the consolidation date. UDR
    recognized a gain on the remeasurement of our previously held
    equity interest in the joint venture, acquired assets and
    assumed liabilities to fair value of $3.4 million and is
    included in “Gain on consolidation of joint ventures”
    on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint
    venture’s activities and accounts are included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial position as of
    December 31, 2009 and consolidated results of operations
    and cash flows during the two day period ending
    December 31, 2009 to UDR’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009.

On December 31, 2009, the Company repaid the outstanding
    balance of $35.0 million on the construction loan held by
    989 Elements. As a result, the Company wrote off the adjustment
    to record the fair value of the

construction loan assumed on December 30, 2009 of
    $1.6 million and is included in “Write off of fair
    market value adjustment” on our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Elements Too”) which is developing a 274
    home apartment community in the central business district of
    Bellevue, Washington. Construction began in the fourth quarter
    of 2006 and is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of
    2010. At closing and at December 31, 2008, we owned 49% of
    the joint venture. Our initial investment was $10.0 million.

On October 16, 2009, our partner resigned as managing
    member and appointed UDR as managing member. In addition, our
    partner relinquished its voting rights and approval rights and
    its ability to substantively participate in the decision-making
    process of the joint venture. As a result of UDR’s control
    of the joint venture, the Company is required to consolidate the
    joint venture under Topic 810. This event required UDR’s
    pre-existing interest in the joint venture, the acquired assets
    and the assumed liabilities to be remeasured at fair value in
    accordance with Topic 805. Prior to consolidation, our equity
    investment in Elements Too was $24.4 million (net of an
    $11.0 million equity loss discussed below) and
    $9.9 million at October 16, 2009 and December 31,
    2008, respectively. The fair value of the assets acquired was
    $100.3 million ($99.5 million of real estate owned and
    $814,000 of working capital assets) and the fair value of
    assumed liabilities was $75.6 million ($70.5 million
    of a construction loan, $917,000 of a derivative instrument, and
    $4.2 million of working capital liabilities) at the
    consolidation date. On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into
    an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49% interest in
    Elements Too in consideration for $3.2 million (outstanding
    at December 31, 2009). At closing, the Company’s
    interest in Elements Too will be 98%. UDR recognized a loss on
    the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in the
    joint venture, acquired assets and assumed liabilities to fair
    value of $1.9 million and is included in “Gain on
    consolidation of joint ventures” on our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. The joint venture’s activities
    and accounts are included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial position as of December 31, 2009 and consolidated
    results of operations and cash flows during the seventy-six day
    period ending December 31, 2009 to UDR’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture (“Bellevue”) which owns an operating retail
    site in Bellevue, Washington. The Company initially planned to
    develop a 430 home high rise apartment building with ground
    floor retail on an existing operating retail center. However,
    during the year ended December 31, 2009, the joint venture
    decided to continue to operate the retail property as opposed to
    developing a high rise apartment building on the site. At
    closing and at December 31, 2008, we owned 49% of the joint
    venture. Our initial investment was $5.7 million.

On December 30, 2009, UDR entered into an agreement with
    our partner to purchase its 49% interest in Bellevue in
    consideration for $5.2 million (outstanding at
    December 31, 2009). At closing, the Company’s interest
    will be 98%. In addition, our partner resigned as managing
    member and appointed UDR as managing member. Concurrent with its
    resignation, our partner relinquished its voting rights and
    approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in
    the decision-making process of the joint venture. As a result of
    UDR’s appointment as managing member, the Company is
    required to consolidate the joint venture under Topic 810. This
    event required UDR’s pre-existing interest in Bellevue, the
    acquired assets and the assumed liabilities at fair value to be
    remeasured at fair value in accordance with Topic 805. Prior to
    consolidation, our equity investment in Bellevue was
    $5.0 million (net of a $5.0 million equity loss
    discussed below) and $10.2 million at December 29,
    2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The fair value of
    the assets acquired was $33.0 million ($32.8 million
    of real estate owned and $211,000 of working capital assets) and
    the fair value of assumed liabilities was $23.0 million
    ($22.3 million of a mortgage payable, $506,000 of a
    derivative instrument, and $213,000 of working capital
    liabilities). UDR recognized a gain on the remeasurement of our
    previously held equity interest in the joint venture, acquired
    assets and assumed liabilities to fair value of $315,000 and is
    included in “Gain on consolidation of joint ventures”
    on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint
    venture’s activities and accounts are included in the

two-day

period ending December 31, 2009 to UDR’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

During 2008, we completed the development of a consolidated
    joint venture located in Marina del Rey, California with 298
    apartment homes and a carrying value of $139.3 million. In
    December 2008, we acquired for $1.5 million our joint
    venture partner’s interest in their profit participation
    and terminated the property management agreement that had
    approximately two years remaining on the pre-existing contract.
    As a result of terminating our arrangement, the Company recorded
    a charge to earnings of $305,000 as the profit component related
    to the management agreement and capitalized the balance as part
    of the investment in real estate. The component capitalized as
    the investment in real estate will be depreciated over the
    average remaining life of the tangible assets. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company included this property as a
    component of our wholly-owned communities.

Unconsolidated
    Joint Ventures

The Company recognizes earnings or losses from our investments
    in unconsolidated joint ventures consisting of our proportionate
    share of the net earnings or loss of the joint venture. In
    addition, we may earn fees for providing management and
    development services to the unconsolidated joint ventures. As of
    December 31, 2009, UDR had investments in the following
    unconsolidated joint ventures which are accounted for under the
    equity method of accounting.

During 2009, the Company established a joint venture with Kuwait
    Finance House to invest up to $450.0 million in multifamily
    properties located in key, high barrier to entry markets. The
    partners will contribute equity of $180.0 million of which
    the Company’s maximum equity contribution will be 30% or
    $54.0 million when fully invested. At closing, we owned 30%
    of the joint venture. Our investment at December 31, 2009
    was $242,000. At December 31, 2009, the joint venture did
    not own any multi-family properties.

In November 2007, UDR and an unaffiliated third party formed a
    joint venture which owns and operates various properties located
    in Texas. In November 2007, UDR sold nine operating properties,
    consisting of 3,690 units, and contributed one property
    under development to the joint venture. The property under
    development has 302 units and was completed in 2008 and
    commenced lease up at that time. UDR contributed cash and
    property equal to 20% of the fair value of the properties. The
    unaffiliated member contributed cash equal to 80% of the fair
    value of the properties comprising the joint venture, which was
    then used to purchase the nine operating properties from UDR.
    Our initial investment was $20.4 million. Our investment at
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was
    $13.9 million and $16.5 million, respectively.

In accordance with Subtopic

323-10,

we
    evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a
    decrease in the value of the investment is

other-than-temporary.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a
    non-cash charge of $16.0 million representing the

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair values below the carrying values of two of
    the Company’s Bellevue, Washington joint ventures, which
    were previously accounted for under the equity method. As
    discussed above, the joint ventures were subsequently
    consolidated and their accounts included in the Company’s
    consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2009 to
    UDR’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31,
    2009. The activities of Bellevue Plaza are included in the
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows during the two
    day period ending December 31, 2009 to UDR’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31,
    2009. The activities of Elements Too are included in the
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows during the

SECURED

Our secured debt instruments generally feature either monthly
    interest and principal or monthly interest-only payments with
    balloon payments due at maturity. For purposes of classification
    in the following table, variable rate debt with a derivative
    financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is deemed
    as fixed rate debt due to the Company having effectively
    established the interest rate for the underlying debt

Subtopic

470-20

applies to all convertible debt instruments that have a
    “net settlement feature”, which means that such
    convertible debt instruments, by their terms, may be settled
    either wholly or partially in cash upon conversion. This
    guidance requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that
    may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion to
    separately account for the liability and equity components in a
    manner reflective of the issuers’ nonconvertible debt
    borrowing rate. The Company adopted provisions under

Subtopic

470-20

as of
    January 1, 2009, and the adoption impacted the historical
    accounting for the 3.625% convertible senior notes due September
    2011 and the 4.00% convertible senior notes due December 2035,
    and resulted in increased interest expense of $4.3 million,

    and $2.29 per share, respectively. For taxable years ending on
    or before December 31, 2009, the IRS is allowing REITS to
    distribute up to 90% of total distributions in common shares
    with the residual distributed in cash as a means of enhancing
    liquidity.

Preferred
    Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
    (Series E) has no stated par value and a liquidation
    preference of $16.61 per share. Subject to certain adjustments
    and conditions, each share of the Series E is convertible
    at any time and from time to time at the holder’s option
    into one share of our common stock prior to the Special
    Dividend. The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote
    on an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with
    the holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders
    for the election of directors or for any other purpose on which
    the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The
    Series E has no stated maturity and is not subject to any
    sinking fund or any mandatory redemption.

Distributions declared on the Series E in for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $1.33 per share. The
    Series E is not listed on any exchange. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, a total of
    2,803,812 shares of the Series E were outstanding,
    respectively.

    units, or OP Units, at a purchase price of $0.0001 per
    share. OP Unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and
    purchase one share of UDR’s Series F for each
    OP Unit held. A total of 2,959,428 and 666,293 shares
    of the Series F, respectively, were outstanding at a value
    of $296 and $67 at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Holders of the Series F are entitled to one
    vote for each share of the Series F they hold, voting
    together with the holders of our common stock, on each matter
    submitted to a vote of security holders at a meeting of our
    stockholders. The Series F does not entitle its holders to
    any other rights, privileges or preferences.

In May 2007, UDR issued 5,400,000 shares of our 6.75%
    Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock
    (Series G). The Series G has no stated par value and a

    be redeemed for cash at our option, in whole or in part, at a
    redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid
    dividends. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the Company repurchased 997,738 and 969,300 shares of
    Series G, respectively, for less than the liquidation
    preference of $25 per share resulting in a $2.6 million and
    $3.1 million benefit to our net income/(loss) attributable
    to common stockholders, respectively.

Dividend
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

UDR’s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the
    “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows common and preferred
    stockholders the opportunity to purchase, through the
    reinvestment of cash dividends, additional shares of UDR’s
    common stock. From inception through December 31, 2009,
    shareholders have elected to utilize the Stock Purchase Plan to
    reinvest their dividends for the equivalent of
    9,957,233 shares of Company common stock. Shares in the
    amount of 13,134,256 were reserved for issuance under the Stock
    Purchase Plan as of December 31, 2009. During the year
    ended December 31, 2009, UDR acquired all shares issued
    through the open market.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

In May 2001, the stockholders of UDR approved the long term
    incentive plan (“LTIP”), which supersedes the 1985
    Stock Option Plan. The LTIP authorizes the granting of awards
    which may take the form of options to purchase shares of common
    stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, dividend
    equivalents, other stock-based awards, and any other right or
    interest relating to common stock or cash incentive awards to
    Company directors, employees and outside trustees to promote the
    success of the Company by linking individual’s compensation
    via grants of share based payment. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the stockholders of UDR voted to amend
    and restate the LTIP to increase the number of shares reserved
    from 4,000,000 shares to 16,000,000 shares on an
    unadjusted basis for issuance upon the grant or exercise of
    awards under the LTIP, which all can be for incentive stock
    option grants. The LTIP generally provides, among other things,
    that options are granted at exercise prices not lower than the
    market value of the shares on the date of grant and that options
    granted must be exercised within 10 years. As of
    December 31, 2009, there were 10,113,864 common shares
    available for issuance under the LTIP.

The LTIP contains change of control provisions allowing for the
    immediate vesting of an award upon certain events such as a
    merger where UDR is not the surviving entity. Upon the death or
    disability of an award recipient all outstanding instruments
    will vest and all restrictions will lapse. Further, upon the
    retirement of an award recipient, all outstanding instruments
    will vest and all restrictions will lapse. The LTIP specifies
    that in the event of a capital transaction, which includes but
    is not limited to stock dividends, stock splits, extraordinary
    cash dividends and spin-offs, the number of shares available for
    grant in totality or to a single individual is to be adjusted
    proportionately. The LTIP specifies that when a capital
    transaction occurs that would dilute the holder of the stock
    award, prior grants are to be adjusted such that the recipient
    is no worse as a result of the capital transaction.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted
    during the year ended December 31, 2009 was estimated at
    $1.19 per share. Utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merten option
    pricing model, the Company used the following assumptions:
    dividend yield of 12.13%, volatility of 42.9%, risk-free
    interest rate of 1.76% and an expected life of approximately
    4.5 years. Total remaining compensation cost related to
    unvested share options as of December 31, 2009 was
    approximately $2.7 million.

The weighted average remaining contractual life on all options
    outstanding as of December 31, 2009 is 2.9 years.
    96,151 of share options had exercise prices between $9.12 and
    $9.99, 3,497,723 of share options had exercise prices between
    $10.06 and $10.30, 312,589 of share options had exercise prices
    between $11.30 and $13.74 and 504,361 of share options had
    exercise prices between $24.38 and $25.10.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized
    $1.3 million of net compensation expense related to our
    stock option grants.

Restricted
    Stock Awards

Restricted stock is granted to Company employees, officers,
    consultants, and directors. The restricted stock is valued on
    the grant date based upon the market price of UDR common stock
    on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recorded over the
    vesting period, which is generally three to four years.
    Restricted stock earn dividends payable in cash until the
    earlier of the date of the underlying restricted stock is
    exercised or the expiration of the underlying restricted stock
    award. Some of the restricted stock is performance based and is
    adjusted based on Company performance. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized
    $7.6 million, $7.0 million, and $6.1 million of
    compensation expense related to the amortization of restricted
    stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the Company
    had issued 1,689,108 shares of restricted stock under the
    LTIP. The total remaining compensation cost on unvested
    restricted stock awards was $6.3 million and has a weighted
    average remaining contractual life of 1.4 years as of
    December 31, 2009.

For income tax purposes, distributions paid to common

    dividends, capital gains, unrecaptured section 1250 gains,
    return of capital, or a combination thereof. Distributions that
    exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits

    $73.0 million, of which approximately $1.8 million
    begins to expire in 2012 with the remainder expiring in 2022
    through 2029. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had a
    valuation allowance of $33.5 million against 100% of its
    deferred tax assets and 50% of its federal net operating losses.
    During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company had a

UDR adopted FASB ASC 740,

Income Taxes

(“Topic
    740”) (formerly FASB Interpretation 48, “Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-An Interpretation of FASB
    Statement No. 109”), on January 1, 2007. Topic
    740 defines a recognition threshold and measurement attribute
    for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Topic
    740 requires the financial statements reflect expected future
    tax consequences of income tax positions presuming the taxing
    authorities’ full knowledge of the tax position and all
    relevant facts, but without considering time values. Topic 740
    also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods,
    disclosure and transition.

The Company evaluates our tax position using a two-step process.
    First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than
    not (greater than 50 percent probability) to be sustained
    upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or
    litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the
    position. Then the Company will determine the amount of benefit
    to recognize and record the amount of the benefit that is more
    likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. When
    applicable, UDR recognizes interest

and/or

penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax
    expense. As of December 31, 2008, we reduced our recognized
    tax benefits under FIN 48 as a result of a change in
    measurement of certain items. As of December 31, 2009, UDR
    does not believe we have any unrecognized tax benefits.

    Company recognized $0 in interest and penalties. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, UDR had $0 of interest and
    penalties accrued, respectively.

The Company files income tax returns in federal and various

FAIR
    VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Effective January 1, 2008, UDR adopted FASB ASC 820,

Fair Value of Measurements and Disclosures

(formerly
    SFAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements”) (“Topic
    820”), which defines fair value based on the price that
    would be received to sell an asset or the exit price that would
    be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date. Topic 820
    establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable
    and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value. The fair
    value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are
    described below:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability
    to access.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than prices
    included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar
    assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
    identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are
    not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
    corroborated with observable market data.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain
    pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar
    techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the fair
    values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes
    receivable, escrow 1031exchange funds, accounts receivable,
    prepaids, real estate taxes payable, accrued interest payable,
    security deposits and prepaid rent, distributions payable and
    accounts payable approximated their carrying values because of
    the short term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair
    values of other financial instruments were determined by the
    Company using available market information and appropriate
    valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to
    interpret market data and develop estimated fair values.
    Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily
    indicative of the amounts the Company would realize on the
    disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different
    market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a
    material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 825,

Financial
    Instruments

(formerly FSP

FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1,

“Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial

We estimate the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments by
    discounting the remaining cash flows of the debt instrument at a
    discount rate equal to the replacement market credit spread plus
    the corresponding treasury yields. Factors considered in
    determining a replacement market credit spread include general
    market conditions, borrower specific credit spreads, time
    remaining to maturity,

loan-to-value

ratios and collateral quality (Level 3).

The Company has derivative contracts that are measured and
    recognized at fair value using the Topic 820 hierarchy. The
    derivative contracts are recorded in “Other assets”
    and in “Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
    liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for
    $2.3 million and $5.9 million, and $62,000 and
    $11.0 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the
    market standard methodology of netting the discounted future
    fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected
    variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments
    (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest
    rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest
    rate curves. The fair values of interest rate options are
    determined using the market standard methodology of discounting
    the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable
    interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The
    variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected
    receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future
    interest rates derived from observable market interest rate
    curves and volatilities.

To comply with the provisions of Topic 820, the Company
    incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately
    reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective
    counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value
    measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative
    contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has
    considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit
    enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual
    puts, and guarantees.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the
    inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of
    the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments
    associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs,
    such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the
    likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However,
    as of December 31, 2009, the Company has assessed the
    significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments
    on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has
    determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not
    significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO

As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative
    valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of

The fair value of the corporate debt securities is determined by
    Level 1 inputs which utilize quoted prices in active
    markets where we have the ability to access values for identical
    assets.

Since the Company recognized an unrealized gain during the year
    ended December 31, 2009, and it does not intend to sell the
    investments at a loss nor will it be required to sell the
    investments before recovery of its amortized cost basis by the
    time the Company’s rights to redeem the debt securities
    become effective in March 2012, the Company does not consider
    the investment in these securities to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired at December 31, 2009.

During the third quarter of 2009, the Company recognized a
    non-cash charge of $16.0 million representing the

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair values below the carrying values of two of
    the Company’s equity investments in our Bellevue,
    Washington unconsolidated joint ventures. (See Note 4,
    “Joint Ventures” for further discussion on these joint
    ventures, which were subsequently consolidated in UDR’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2009.) The Company did not recognize any

other-than-temporary

decrease in the value of its other investments in unconsolidated
    joint ventures during the year ended December 31, 2009. We
    consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value
    of the investment is

other-than-temporary.

These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the
    venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the
    entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the
    entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture
    partners and its lenders. Based on the significance of the
    unobservable inputs, we classify these fair value measurements
    within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

After determining an

other-than-temporary

decrease in the value of an equity method has occurred, we
    estimate the fair value of our investment by estimating the
    proceeds we would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation of the
    investment at the date of measurement. Inputs reflect
    management’s best estimate of what market participants
    would use in pricing the investment giving consideration to the
    terms of the joint venture agreement and the estimated
    discounted future cash flows to be generated from the underlying
    joint venture asset. The inputs and assumptions utilized to
    estimate the future cash flows of the underlying asset are based
    upon the Company’s evaluation of the economy, market
    trends, operating results, and other factors, including
    judgments regarding costs to complete any construction
    activities, lease up and occupancy rates, rental rates,
    inflation rates, capitalization rates utilized to estimate the
    projected cash flows at the disposition, and discount rates.

DERIVATIVES
    AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

Risk
    Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its
    business operations and economic conditions. The Company
    principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business
    and operational risks through management of its core business
    activities. The Company manages economic risks, including
    interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing
    the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the
    Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage
    exposures that arise from business activities that result in the
    receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts,
    the value of which are determined by interest rates. The
    Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to
    manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the
    Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or
    expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s
    investments and borrowings.

Cash Flow
    Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives
    are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its
    exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this
    objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and
    caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
    Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the
    receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange
    for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the
    agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
    Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the
    receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest
    rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for
    an up front premium.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
    derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is
    recorded in “Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income/(Loss)” and is subsequently reclassified into
    earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2009,
    such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows
    associated with existing variable-rate debt. The ineffective
    portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is
    recognized directly in earnings. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company recorded less than $1,000 of
    ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to reset date and index
    mismatches between the derivative and the hedged item.

Amounts reported in “Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income/(Loss)” related to derivatives will be reclassified
    to interest expense as interest payments are made on the
    Company’s variable-rate debt. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company estimates that an additional
    $5.7 million will be reclassified as an increase to
    interest expense.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had the following
    outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as
    cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (

Credit-risk-related
    Contingent Features

The Company has agreements with some of its derivative
    counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if the
    Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default
    where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by
    the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default
    on its derivative obligations; or (2) the Company could be
    declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment
    of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due
    to the Company’s default on the indebtedness.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Certain of the Company’s agreements with its derivative
    counterparties contain provisions where if there is a change in
    the Company’s financial condition that materially changes
    the Company’s creditworthiness in an adverse manner, the
    Company may be required to fully collateralize its obligations
    under the derivative instrument.

The Company also has an agreement with a derivative counterparty
    that incorporates the loan and financial covenant provisions of
    the Company’s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the
    derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with these covenant
    provisions would result in the Company being in default on any
    derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement.

As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of derivatives in a
    net liability position, which includes accrued interest but
    excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to
    these agreements was $6.7 million. As of December 31,
    2009, the Company has not posted any collateral related to these
    agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions
    at December 31, 2009, it would have been required to settle
    its obligations under the agreements at their termination value
    of $6.7 million.

(a)

For purposes of our ground lease contracts, the Company uses the
    minimum lease payment, if stated in the agreement. For ground
    lease agreements where there is a reset provision based on the
    communities appraised value or consumer price index but does not
    included a specified minimum lease payment, the Company uses the
    current rent over the remainder of the lease term.

UDR incurred $5.0 million, $4.1 million and
    $1.4 million of ground rent expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The
    Company incurred $2.0 million, $1.4 million and
    $1.1 million of rent expense related to office space for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively.

Contingencies

Series D
    Out-Performance Program

In February 2006, the Board of Directors of UDR approved the
    Series D Out-Performance Program (the “Series D
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers of
    UDR (the “Series D Participants”) were given the
    opportunity to invest indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests
    in UDR Out-Performance IV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
    company (the “Series D LLC”), the only asset of
    which is a special class of partnership units of the Operating
    Partnership (“Series D Out-Performance Partnership
    Shares” or “Series D OPPSs”). The
    Series D Program was part of the New Out-Performance
    Program approved by UDR’s stockholders in May 2005. The
    Series D LLC agreed to sell 830,000 membership units
    unadjusted for the Special Dividend to certain members of
    UDR’s senior management at a price of $1.00 per unit. The
    aggregate purchase price of $830,000 for the Series D
    OPPSs, assuming 100% participation, was based upon the advice of
    an independent valuation expert. The Series D Program
    measured the cumulative total return on our common stock over
    the

36-month

period beginning January 1, 2006 and ending
    December 31, 2008.

The Series D Program was designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period was at least
    the equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized
    (“Minimum Return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if UDR’s
    cumulative total return satisfied these criteria, the
    Series D LLC as holder of the Series D OPPSs would
    receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series D
    Participants as holders of interests in the Series D
    LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from
    the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and
    allocations that would have been received on the number of
    OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of UDR’s common stock over the measurement period
    exceeds the Minimum Return (such excess being the “Excess
    Return”);

ii. multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by UDR’s
    market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares
    outstanding over the

36-month

period, including common stock, OP Units, common stock
    equivalents and OP Units); and

iii. dividing the number obtained in (ii) by the
    market value of one share of UDR’s common stock on the
    valuation date, computed as the volume-weighted average price
    per day of the common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
    preceding the valuation date.

For the Series D OPPSs, the number determined pursuant to
    clause (ii) above was capped at 1% of market capitalization.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of
    UDR’s common stock did not meet the Minimum Return, then
    the Series D Participants would forfeit their entire
    initial investment. At the conclusion of the measurement period,
    December 31, 2008, the total cumulative return on
    UDR’s common stock did not meet



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the minimum return threshold. As a result, there were no payouts
    under the Series D OPPSs program and the investment in the
    amount of $443,267 made by the holders of the Series D
    OPPSs was forfeited.

Series E
    Out-Performance Program

In February 2007, the board of directors of UDR approved the
    Series E Out-Performance Program (the “Series E
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers of
    UDR (the “Series E Participants”) were given the
    opportunity to invest indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests
    in UDR Out-Performance V, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
    company (the “Series E LLC”), the only asset of
    which is a special class of partnership units of the Operating
    Partnership (“Series E Out-Performance Partnership
    Shares” or “Series E OPPSs”). The
    Series E Program was part of the New Out-Performance
    Program approved by UDR’s stockholders in May 2005. The
    Series E LLC agreed to sell 805,000 membership units to
    certain members of UDR’s senior management at a price of
    $1.00 per unit. The aggregate purchase price of $805,000 for the
    Series E OPPSs, assuming 100% participation, was based upon
    the advice of an independent valuation expert. The Series E
    Program measured the cumulative total return on our common stock
    over the

36-month

period beginning January 1, 2007 and ending
    December 31, 2009.

The Series E Program was designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period was at least
    the equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized
    (“Minimum Return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if UDR’s
    cumulative total return satisfied these criteria, the
    Series E LLC as holder of the Series E OPPSs would
    receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series E
    Participants as holders of interests in the Series E
    LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from
    the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and
    allocations that would have been received on the number of
    OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of UDR’s common stock over the measurement period
    exceeds the Minimum Return (such excess being the “Excess
    Return”);

ii. multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by UDR’s
    market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares
    outstanding over the

36-month

period, including common stock, OP Units, common stock
    equivalents and OP Units); and

iii. dividing the number obtained in (ii) by the
    market value of one share of UDR’s common stock on the
    valuation date, computed as the volume-weighted average price
    per day of the common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
    preceding the valuation date.

For the Series E OPPSs, the number determined pursuant to
    clause (ii) above was capped at 0.5% of market
    capitalization.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of
    UDR’s common stock did not meet the Minimum Return, then
    the Series E Participants would forfeit their entire
    initial investment.

At the conclusion of the measurement period, December 31,
    2009, the total cumulative return on UDR’s common stock did
    not meet the minimum return threshold. As a result, there were
    no payouts under the Series E OPPSs program and the
    investment in the amount of $517,500 made by the holders of the
    Series E OPPSs was forfeited.

Litigation
    and Legal Matters

UDR is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising
    in the ordinary course of business. UDR cannot determine the
    ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and
    claims at this time. UDR

believes that such liability, to the extent not provided for

REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

FASB ASC Topic 280,

Segment Reporting

(formerly
    SFAS 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
    and Related Information”) (“Topic 280”), requires
    that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the
    chief operating decision maker to decide how to allocate
    resources and for purposes of assessing such segments’
    performance. UDR’s chief operating decision maker is
    comprised of several members of its executive management team
    who use several generally accepted industry financial measures
    to assess the performance of the business for our reportable
    operating segments.

UDR owns and operates multifamily apartment communities
    throughout the United States that generate rental and other
    property related income through the leasing of apartment homes
    to a diverse base of tenants. The primary financial measures for
    UDR’s apartment communities are rental income and net
    operating income (“NOI”). Rental income represents
    gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss
    and bad debt. NOI is defined as total revenues less direct
    property operating expenses. UDR’s chief operating decision
    maker utilizes NOI as the key measure of segment profit or loss.

UDR’s two reportable segments are same communities and
    non-mature/other communities:

•

Same communities

represent those communities acquired,
    developed, and stabilized prior to January 1, 2008, and
    held as of December 31, 2009. A comparison of operating
    results from the prior year is meaningful as these communities
    were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses
    as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to
    conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community
    is not held for disposition within the current year. A community
    is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90%
    occupancy for at least three consecutive months.

•

Non-mature/other communities

represent those communities
    that were acquired or developed in 2007, 2008 or 2009, sold
    properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as
    real estate held for disposition, condominium conversion
    properties, joint venture properties, properties managed by
    third parties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use
    properties.

Management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment
    communities on a same community and non-mature/other basis, as
    well as individually and geographically. This is consistent with
    the aggregation criteria of Topic 280 as each of our apartment
    communities generally has similar economic characteristics,
    facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore, the Company’s
    reportable segments have been aggregated by geography in a
    manner identical to that which is provided to the chief
    operating decision maker.

All revenues are from external customers and no single tenant or
    related group of tenants contributed 10% or more of UDR’s
    total revenues during the three years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008, or 2007.

The accounting policies applicable to the operating segments
    described above are the same as those described in Note 1,
    “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The
    following table details rental income and NOI for UDR’s
    reportable segments for the three years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008, and 2007, and
