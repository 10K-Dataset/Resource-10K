PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. is a self administered real
estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires,
renovates, develops, and manages middle-market apartment
communities nationwide. At December 31, 2004, our apartment
portfolio included 273 communities located in 43 markets, with a
total of 78,855 completed apartment homes. In addition, we had
three apartment communities under development.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue
to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally
require that our assets consist primarily of real estate, our
income be derived primarily from real estate, and that we
distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than
our net capital gain) to our stockholders. As a qualified REIT,
we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on our
REIT taxable income to the extent we distribute such income to
our stockholders. In 2004, we declared total distributions of
$1.17 per share to our stockholders, which represents our
28th year of consecutive dividend increases to our stockholders.

We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003,
we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland.
Our corporate headquarters is located at 400 East Cary Street,
Richmond, Virginia. Our principal executive offices are located
at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite 200, Highlands Ranch,
Colorado. As of March 1, 2005, we had 1,943 full-time
employees and 178 part-time employees.

Our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships, Heritage
Communities L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and United
Dominion Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. Unless the
context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to
“we,” “us,” “our,” “the
company,” or “United Dominion” refer collectively
to United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

2004 Accomplishments



Business Objectives and Operating Strategies

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic
returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders
with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve
this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following
goals and strategies:

Acquisitions

During 2004, using the proceeds from our disposition program,
equity and debt offerings, we acquired 28 communities with 8,060
apartment homes at a total cost of approximately
$1.0 billion, including the assumption of secured debt. In
addition, we purchased one parcel of land for $16.3 million.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

Dispositions

We regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase portfolio
profitability. During 2004, we sold over 5,400 of our slower
growing, non-core apartment homes while exiting some markets in
an effort to



increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. Proceeds
from the disposition program were used primarily to reduce debt
and fund acquisitions.

Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property
include:

At December 31, 2004, there were 12 apartment communities
and one parcel of land classified as real estate held for
disposition. We are in the market for replacement properties
that will correspond with our expected sales activity to prevent
dilution to earnings.

Upgrading and Development Activities

During 2004, we continued to reposition properties in targeted
markets where there was an opportunity to add value and achieve
greater than inflationary increases in rents over the long term.
In 2004, we spent $17.6 million on three development
projects that are expected to be completed in the first half of
2006. In addition, revenue enhancing capital expenditures,
including kitchen and bath renovations, and other extensive
interior upgrades totaled $45.9 million or $599 per
home for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The following wholly-owned projects were under development as of
December 31, 2004:

In addition, we owned eight parcels of land held for future
development aggregating $25.5 million at December 31,
2004. Four of the eight parcels represent additional phases to
existing communities.

Financing Activities

As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we
utilized proceeds from dispositions, equity offerings and
refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, and
acquire apartment communities. The following is a list of our
major financing activities in 2004:

•

Repaid $131.8 million of secured debt and
    $46.6 million of unsecured debt.

•

Sold $125 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.13% senior unsecured notes due January 2014
    ($75 million in January and $50 million in March)
    under our medium-term note program. These notes represent a
    re-opening of the 5.13% senior unsecured notes due January
    2014 that we issued in October 2003, and these notes constitute
    a single series of notes, bringing the aggregate principal
    amount outstanding of the 5.13% senior unsecured notes to
    $200 million. The net proceeds of $126.0 million were
    used to repay secured and unsecured debt obligations maturing in
    the first quarter of 2004 and to fund the acquisition of
    apartment homes.



Markets and Competitive Conditions

At December 31, 2004, we owned 273 apartment communities in
43 markets in 17 states. Of those markets, 25 markets, or
61%, generated positive same community net operating income
growth for the



fourth quarter of 2004 when compared to the same period in the
prior year. We have a geographically diverse portfolio and we
believe that this diversification increases investment
opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical
local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the
stability and predictability of our earnings.

We believe changing demographics will have a significant impact
on the apartment industry over the next two decades. In
particular, we believe the annual number of young people
entering the workforce and creating households will be
significantly higher over the next 10 to 15 years as
compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past
10 years. The number of single people and single parent
households continues to grow significantly. The immigrant
population is also expected to grow at an accelerated pace. Each
of these population segments has a high propensity to rent.

Despite a strengthening United States economy, significant
productivity growth has adversely affected employment growth,
which is the primary driver of demand in our business. In
addition, a sustained low mortgage interest rate environment,
combined with government and builder incentives to first time
home buyers, has further siphoned off what would traditionally
be demand for apartment homes. To maintain occupancy levels
during these economic conditions, we have reduced rents,
increased our marketing expenses, and provided concessions to
our residents.

In most of our markets, competition for new residents is
intense. Some competing communities offer features that our
communities do not have. Competing communities frequently use
concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive
advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer
than our communities. The competitive position of each community
is different depending upon many factors including sub-market
supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors
compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop
new properties. These competitors include insurance companies,
pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment
companies and other apartment REITs. This competition could
increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely
pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources, or lower
capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete
effectively for residents and investments. We believe our
competitive advantages include:

Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease
management, improved expense control, increased resident
retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive
plans tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan
of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in
targeting the middle-market of renters across a geographically
diverse platform, should position us for continued operational
improvement.

Communities

At December 31, 2004, our apartment portfolio included 273
communities having a total of 78,855 completed apartment homes.
In addition, we had three apartment communities under
development. The overall quality of our portfolio has
significantly improved since 2001 with the disposition of
non-core apartment homes and our upgrade program. The upgrading
of the portfolio provides several key benefits related to
portfolio profitability. It enables us to raise rents more
significantly and to attract residents with higher levels of
disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of
expenses, such as water



and sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. In addition,
it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per
apartment home, and therefore increases cash flow.

Same Communities

For 2004, same community property operating income decreased
1.2% or $3.9 million compared to 2003. The overall decrease
in property operating income was primarily attributable to a
0.5% or $2.3 million increase in revenues from rental and
other income that was offset by a 3.2% or $6.2 million
increase in operating expenses. The increase in revenues from
rental and other income was primarily driven by a 7.7% or
$2.8 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 14.3% or
$2.1 million increase in utility reimbursement income.
These increases in income were offset by a 0.7% or
$3.6 million decrease in rental rates. Physical occupancy
increased 0.8% to 93.8%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
by a 5.4% or $2.8 million increase in personnel costs, a
4.7% or $1.5 million increase in repair and maintenance
costs, a 3.5% or $1.1 million increase in utilities
expense, and a 1.6% or $0.8 million increase in property
taxes.

Customers

We focus on the broad middle-market segment of the apartment
market that generally consists of renters-by-necessity. This
group includes young professionals, blue-collar families, single
parent households, older singles, immigrants, non-related
parties and families renting while waiting to purchase a home.
We believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in
terms of rent growth, stability of occupancy and investment
opportunities.

We believe there will be a significant increase in the number of
younger renters over the next 10 to 15 years, and that the
immigrant population will remain a significant and growing part
of the renter base. Accordingly, we plan to target some of our
incremental investments to communities that will be attractive
to younger households or to the immigrant populations. These
communities will often be located close to where these residents
work, shop and play.

Tax Matters

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet
certain tests that, among other things, generally require that
our assets consist primarily of real estate, our income be
derived primarily from real estate and that we distribute at
least 90% of our taxable income (other than our net capital
gain) to our stockholders. Provided we maintain our
qualification as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to
federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to
the extent net income is distributed to our stockholders.

Inflation

Substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or
less, which may enable us to realize increased rents upon
renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Such
short-term leases generally minimize the risk to us of the
adverse effects of inflation, although as a general rule these
leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term
without penalty. Short-term leases and relatively consistent
demand allow rents, and therefore cash flow from the portfolio,
to provide an attractive hedge against inflation.

Environmental Matters

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental
protection regulations has not had a material effect on our
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However,
in the past, the issue has been raised regarding the presence of
asbestos and other hazardous materials in existing real estate
properties. We have a property management plan for hazardous
materials. As part of the plan, Phase I environmental site
investigations and reports have been completed for each property
we own. In



addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to
acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified
environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior
to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it
is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal
all environmental liabilities, or that some material
environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some
cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive
acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of
hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been
unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not
believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale
abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through
professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos,
lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a
conservative posture toward accepting known risk, we can
minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with
environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential
housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential
residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such
notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the
communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in
that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint
are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any
such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by
children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our
properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a
material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.
We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we
are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance,
liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in
connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that
the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental
laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us
or our financial condition or results of operations. Future
environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may
require additional remediation of existing conditions that are
not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements
are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could
have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our
communities, with limits of liability customary within the
industry to insure against liability claims and related defense
costs. We are also insured, in all material respects, against
the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to
reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to
repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income
during the reconstruction period.

Factors Affecting Our Business and Prospects

There are many factors that affect our business and our results
of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The
following is a description of some of the important factors that
may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to
differ materially from those currently expected or desired.

Unfavorable Changes in Apartment Market and Economic
Conditions Could Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels and Rental
Rates.

Market and economic conditions in the metropolitan
areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy
levels and rental rates and, therefore, our profitability.
Factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the
following:



•

rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating
    rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to
    offset increases in operating costs.

The strength of the United States economy has become
increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of
terrorism. At the same time, productivity enhancements and the
increased exportation of labor have resulted in limited job
growth despite an improving economy. Continued weakness in job
creation, or any worsening of current economic conditions,
generally and in our principal market areas, could have a
material adverse effect on our occupancy levels, our rental
rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of
apartment communities. This may impair our ability to satisfy
our financial obligations and pay distributions to our
stockholders.

Acquisitions or New Development May Not Achieve Anticipated
Results.

We intend to continue to selectively acquire
apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. Our
acquisition activities and their success are subject to the
following risks:

•

an acquired community may fail to perform as we expected in
    analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure related to
    the acquired property may go undetected during our due diligence
    procedures,

•

when we acquire an apartment community, we often invest
    additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing
    profitability. These additional investments may not produce the
    anticipated improvements in profitability, and

•

new developments may not achieve pro forma rents or occupancy
    levels, or problems with construction or local building codes
    may delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a
    development community.

Possible Difficulty of Selling Apartment Communities Could
Limit Operational and Financial Flexibility.

We periodically
dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our
strategic objectives, but market conditions could change and
purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us. A
weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio
promptly in response to changing economic conditions.
Furthermore, a significant portion of the proceeds from our
overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order
for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under
Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, so that any
related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax
purposes. As a result, we may not have immediate access to all
of the cash flow generated from our property sales. In addition,
federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of
communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and
this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when
market conditions are favorable.

Increased Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease
Apartment Homes or Increase or Maintain Rents.

Our apartment
communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in
attracting residents, including other apartment communities and
single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single-and
multi-family homes. Competitive housing in a particular area
could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and
increase or maintain rents.

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and
Create Refinancing Risk.

We are subject to the risks
normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that
our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make
required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict
our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt
covenant restraints. We cannot assure you that sufficient cash
flow will be available to make all required principal payments
and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our
status as a REIT, nor can we assure you that the full limits of
our line of credit will be available to us if our operating
performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants.
Additionally, we are likely to need to refinance substantially
all of our outstanding debt as it matures. We may not be able to
refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not
be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could
create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity
when we would otherwise not choose to do so.



Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt
Service Payments and Distributions to Stockholders.

If our
apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental
income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required
payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to
pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely
affected. The following factors, among others, may affect the
net rental income generated by our apartment communities:

Expenses associated with our investment in a community, such as
debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance
costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a
reduction in rental income from that community. If a community
is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make
the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of
foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies
by the mortgage holder.

Debt Level May Be Increased.

Our current debt policy
does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we
may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by
covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We manage our
debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject
to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount
of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our
ability to service the additional debt.

Financing May Not Be Available and Could be Dilutive.

Our
ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access
to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured
lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt,
and equity financing, including common and preferred equity.
Debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient
amounts, or on favorable terms or at all. If we issue additional
equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions
instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing
stockholders could be diluted.

Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our
Profitability.

We intend to continue to develop and
construct apartment communities. Development activities may be
conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through
joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. Our development and
construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:



•

when we sell to third parties homes or properties that we
    developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or
    construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the
    limits of our insurance.

Construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets,
and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have, in some
cases, exceeded our original estimates. We may experience
similar cost increases in the future. Our inability to charge
rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any
increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our Growth.

We may from time to time make acquisitions outside of our
existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. We may
be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new
markets, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new
markets. These risks include, among others:

Changing Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and
Could Affect the Market Price of Our Securities.

We
currently have, and expect to incur in the future,
interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest
rates. Therefore, if interest rates increase, our interest costs
will rise to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged
effectively. In addition, an increase in market interest rates
may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield,
which could adversely affect the market price of our common and
preferred stock and debt securities.

Limited Investment Opportunities Could Adversely Affect Our
Growth.

We expect that other real estate investors will
compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop
new properties. These competitors include insurance companies,
pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment
companies and other apartment REITs. This competition could
increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely
pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources than we
do. As a result, we may not be able to make attractive
investments on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our
growth.

Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel
Could Create Inefficiencies.

To grow successfully, we must
be able to apply our experience in managing our existing
portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of
properties. In addition, we must be able to integrate new
management and operations personnel as our organization grows in
size and complexity. Failures in either area will result in
inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return
on our investments and our overall profitability.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May
Result in Material Charges.

From time to time when we
anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period
prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest
rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the
predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time
we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our
exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in
market interest rates. If the terms of new debt securities are
not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall
below that which we incur under a particular interest rate
hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore, the
settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and
may in the future involve material charges.

Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could
Result in Substantial Costs.

Under various federal, state
and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or
operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and
remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly
owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often
regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility



for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or
former ownership or operation of the real estate. In addition,
we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third
parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up
costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs
could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws
create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure
their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to
properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially
and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent
an affected property.

We are Subject to Certain Tax Risks.

We have elected to
be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Our
qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous
requirements (some on an annual and quarterly basis) established
under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code
provisions for which there are only limited judicial or
administrative interpretations, and involves the determination
of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within
our control. We intend that our current organization and method
of operation enable us to qualify as a REIT, but we may not so
qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the
future. In addition, U.S. federal income tax laws governing
REITs and other corporations and the administrative
interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time,
potentially with retroactive effect. Future legislation, new
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions
could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or
adversely affect our stockholders.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be
subject to federal income tax (including any applicable
alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at corporate
rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our
stockholders in computing our taxable income. We may also be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year in which we failed to qualify. The additional
tax liability would reduce our net earnings available for
investment or distribution to stockholders. In addition, we
would no longer be required to make distributions to our
stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will
continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes
on our income and property.

We May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries, Which Could Have Adverse Tax Consequences.

We
have established several taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite our
qualification as a REIT, our taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay
federal income tax on their taxable income. In addition, we must
comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a REIT for
federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments
in our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally do not constitute
permissible income and investments for these tests. While we
will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable REIT
subsidiaries will not adversely affect our REIT qualification,
we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve
that result. Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty
tax, or we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on
real property sales, or our taxable REIT subsidiaries may be
denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable
REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in
nature.

Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited
Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain
Attributable to the Transaction.

From time to time, we may
transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under
the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of
properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as
income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty
tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do
not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of
property are prohibited transactions. However, whether property
is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that
depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the
particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend
that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are
prohibited transactions. If the Internal Revenue Service were to
argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property
constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required
to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the
prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to
retain future gains on real property sales. In addition, income
from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability
to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT for
federal income tax purposes.



Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to
Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in Our
Stockholders’ Best Interests.

Maryland business
statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire
control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to
various Maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging
offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty
of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would
be in our stockholders’ best interests. The Maryland
General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business
combination transactions between us and any person who acquires
beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10% or
more of the voting power without our board of directors’
prior approval. Any such business combination transaction could
not be completed until five years after the person acquired such
voting power, and generally only with the approval of
stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast
and


/


%
of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested
stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also
provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our
equity stock that represent 10% (and certain higher levels) of
the voting power in electing directors will have no voting
rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares
eligible to vote.

Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability
of Our Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company
May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to Our
Stockholders.

One of the requirements for maintenance of our
qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is that
no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may
be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities
specified in the Internal Revenue Code, during the last half of
any taxable year. Our amended and restated articles of
incorporation contain ownership and transfer restrictions
relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with
this requirement. These restrictions include a provision that
generally limits a person from beneficially owning or
constructively owning shares of our outstanding equity stock in
excess of a 9.9% ownership interest, unless our board of
directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation,
provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to
exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. These
provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a
change of control might involve a premium price for our
stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’
best interests.

Under the terms of our shareholder rights plan, our board of
directors can, in effect, prevent a person or group from
acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common
stock. Unless our board of directors approves the person’s
purchase, after that person acquires more than 15% of our
outstanding common stock, all other stockholders will have the
right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less
than their then fair market value. Purchases by other
stockholders would substantially reduce the value and influence
of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person.
Our board of directors, however, can prevent the shareholder
rights plan from operating in this manner. This gives our board
of directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a
person’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising
in the ordinary course of business. We cannot determine the
ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and

have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flow.

PART II

Item 5.

Market For Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
    Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities

Common Stock

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol “UDR.” The following tables set forth the
quarterly high and low sale prices per common share reported on
the NYSE for each quarter of the last two years. Distribution
information for common stock reflects distributions declared per
share for each calendar quarter and paid at the end of the
following month.

On March 1, 2005, the closing sale price of our common
stock was $22.35 per share on the NYSE and there were 6,779
holders of record of the 137,023,872 outstanding shares of our
common stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax purposes,
approximately 66% of the distributions for each of the four
quarters of 2004 represented ordinary income, 17% represented
long-term capital gain, 7% represented unrecaptured
section 1250 gain, and 10% represented return of capital to
our stockholders.

We pay regular quarterly distributions to holders of shares of
our common stock. Future distributions will be at the discretion
of our board of directors and will depend on our actual funds
from operations, financial condition and capital requirements,
the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code, and other factors. The annual
distribution payment for calendar year 2004 necessary for us to
maintain our status as a REIT was approximately $0.69 per
share. We declared total distributions of $1.17 per share
of common stock for 2004.

A covenant in our $500 million unsecured revolving credit
facility prohibits the payment of dividends and distributions on
our common stock in excess of 95% of our “Funds From
Operations,” as defined in the credit facility, during any
period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Despite this
covenant but except as provided in the following sentence, we
may pay dividends required to maintain our qualification as a
REIT



under the Internal Revenue Code. However, if certain defaults or
events of default exist under such facility, this covenant
prohibits the payment of dividends and distributions in all
circumstances.

Series B Preferred Stock

The Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock has no
stated par value and a liquidation preference of $25 per
share. The Series B has no voting rights except as required
by law. The Series B has no stated maturity and is not
subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not
convertible into any of our other securities. The Series B
is not redeemable prior to May 29, 2007. On or after this
date, the Series B may be redeemed for cash at our option,
in whole or in part, at a redemption price of $25 per share
plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The redemption price is
payable solely out of the sale proceeds of our other capital
stock. All dividends due and payable on the Series B have
been accrued or paid as of the end of each fiscal year.

Distributions declared on the Series B in 2004 were
$2.15 per share or $0.5375 per quarter. The
Series B is listed on the NYSE under the symbol
“UDRpb.” At December 31, 2004, a total of
5,416,009 shares of the Series B were outstanding.

Series D Preferred Stock

All of the remaining outstanding shares of our Series D
Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock have been
converted by the holder into shares of our common stock. The
Series D had no stated maturity, no stated par value, no
voting rights except as required by law, and a liquidation
preference of $25 per share. The Series D was
convertible at any time into 1.5385 shares of common stock,
subject to certain adjustments, at the option of the holder of
the Series D. We had the option to redeem at any time all
or part of the Series D at a price per share of $25,
payable in cash, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, provided
that the current market price of our common stock was at least
equal to the conversion price, initially set at $16.25 per
share.

In 2004, we exercised our right to redeem the remaining
2 million shares of our Series D that were
outstanding. Upon receipt of our redemption notice, the shares
to be redeemed were converted by the holder into
3,076,769 shares of common stock at a price of
$16.25 per share. In 2003, we exercised our right to redeem
6 million shares of our Series D. Upon receipt of our
redemption notice, the 6 million shares to be redeemed were
converted by the holder into 9,230,923 shares of common
stock at a price of $16.25 per share. Because the shares of
common stock that were issued upon conversion of the
Series D were issued in transactions not involving a public
offering, the transactions are exempt from registration under
the Securities Act of 1933 in accordance with Section 4(2)
of the Securities Act.

Distributions declared on the Series D in 2004 were
$2.09 per share or $0.5223 per quarter. The
Series D was not listed on any exchange. At
December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding shares of the
Series D.

Series E Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock has no
stated par value and a liquidation preference of $16.61 per
share. Subject to certain adjustments and conditions, each share
of the Series E is convertible at any time and from time to
time at the holder’s option into one share of our common
stock. The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on
an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the
holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for
the election of directors or for any other purpose on which the
holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E
has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or
any mandatory redemption.

In 2004, Series E holders converted a total of
621,405 shares of Series E into 621,405 shares of
our common stock. Because the shares of common stock that were
issued upon conversion of the Series E were issued in
transactions not involving a public offering, the transactions
are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in
accordance with Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.



Distributions declared on the Series E in 2004 were
$1.33 per share or $0.3322 per quarter. The
Series E is not listed on any exchange. At
December 31, 2004 a total of 2,803,812 shares of the
Series E were outstanding.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under
which holders of our common stock and our Series B
preferred stock may elect to automatically reinvest their
distributions and make additional cash payments to acquire
additional shares of our common stock. Stockholders who do not
participate in the plan continue to receive dividends as
declared. As of March 1, 2005, there were 3,749
participants in the plan.

Operating Partnership Units

From time to time we issue shares of our common stock in
exchange for operating partnership units, or OP Units,
tendered to our operating partnerships, United Dominion Realty,
L.P. and Heritage Communities L.P., for redemption in accordance
with the provisions of their respective partnership agreements.
At December 31, 2004, there were 10,024,380 OP Units
(of which 1,791,329 and 0 are owned by the holders of the
Series A OPPS and the Series B OPPS, respectively (see
Notes 1 and 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements)) and 355,255 OP Units in United Dominion
Realty, L.P. and Heritage Communities L.P., respectively, that
were owned by limited partners. The holder of the OP Units
has the right to require United Dominion Realty, L.P. to redeem
all or a portion of the OP Units held by the holder in
exchange for a cash payment based on the market value of our
common stock at the time of redemption. However, United Dominion
Realty, L.P.’s obligation to pay the cash amount is subject
to the prior right of the company to acquire such OP Units
in exchange for either the cash amount or shares of our common
stock. Heritage Communities L.P. OP Units are convertible
into common stock in lieu of cash, at our option, once the
holder elects to convert, at an exchange ratio of
1.575 shares for each OP Unit. During 2004, we issued
a total of 170,209 shares of common stock in exchange for
OP Units.

Purchases of Equity Securities

On June 3, 1999, our board of directors authorized the
repurchase in open market transactions, in block transactions,
or otherwise, of up to 5.5 million shares of common stock.
On December 5, 2000, our board of directors authorized the
purchase of up to an additional 5.5 million shares of
common stock in open market transactions, in block purchases or
otherwise. As of December 31, 2004, we have repurchased a
total of 8,749,763 shares of common stock under this
program. As disclosed in the table below, we did not purchase
any shares of our common stock during the quarter ended
December 31, 2004.

Business Overview

We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns,
acquires, renovates, develops, and manages middle-market
apartment communities nationwide. We were formed in 1972 as a
Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of
incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. Our subsidiaries
include two operating partnerships, Heritage Communities L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership, and United Dominion Realty, L.P.,
a Delaware limited partnership. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all references in this Report to “we,”
“us,” “our,” “the company,” or
“United Dominion” refer collectively to United
Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2004, our portfolio included 273
communities with 78,855 apartment homes nationwide. The
following table summarizes our market information by major
geographic markets



(includes real estate held for disposition, real estate under
development, and land, but excludes commercial properties):



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial
obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale or
maturity of existing assets, or by the acquisition of additional
funds through capital management. Both the coordination of asset
and liability maturities and effective capital management are
important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of
liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by
rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related
to our portfolio of apartment homes. We routinely use our
unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain
investing and financing activities prior to arranging for
longer-term financing. During the past several years, proceeds
from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing
and financing activities.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements
generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings
under credit arrangements. We expect to meet certain long-term
liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the
repayment of financing on development activities, and potential
property acquisitions, through long-term secured and unsecured
borrowings, the disposition of properties, and the issuance of
additional debt or equity securities. We believe that our net
cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet
both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the
company in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short-
and long-term. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for
improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected
to be funded from property operations.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission which provides for the issuance of up to
an aggregate of $1.5 billion in common shares, preferred
shares, and debt securities to facilitate future financing
activities in the public capital markets. This shelf
registration statement replaces our previous $1.0 billion
shelf registration statement and includes $331.3 million of
unissued securities carried forward from the previous
$1.0 billion shelf registration statement. Throughout 2004,
we completed various financing activities under our
$1.5 billion shelf registration statement. These activities
are summarized in the section titled “Financing
Activities” that follows. As of December 31, 2004,
approximately $1.1 billion of equity and debt securities
remained available for use under the shelf registration
statement. Access to capital markets is dependent on market
conditions at the time of issuance.

In July 2004, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our rating
on our senior unsecured debt to Baa2 from Baa3 and our preferred
stock to Baa3 from Ba1 with a stable outlook.

In October 2004, we filed a prospectus supplement under the
Securities Act of 1933 relating to the offering of up to
5 million shares of our common stock that we may issue and
sell through an agent from time to time in “at the market
offerings,” as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities
Act of 1933. Any sales of these shares will be made under our
$1.5 billion shelf registration statement pursuant to a
sales agreement that we entered into with the agent in July
2003. The sales price of the common stock that may be sold under
the sales agreement will be no lower than the minimum price
designated by us prior to the sale. As of December 31,
2004, we have sold a total of 472,000 shares of common
stock pursuant to the sales agreement at a weighted average
sales price of $20.36, for net proceeds to us of approximately
$9.4 million.

Future Capital Needs

Future development expenditures are expected to be funded
primarily through joint ventures, with proceeds from the sale of
property, with construction loans and, to a lesser extent, with
cash flows provided by operating activities. Acquisition
activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed
through the issuance of equity and debt securities, the issuance
of operating partnership units, the assumption or placement of
secured and/or unsecured debt, and by the reinvestment of
proceeds from the sale of properties.



During 2005, we have approximately $27.9 million of secured
debt and $71.1 million of unsecured debt maturing and we
anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings
under our secured or unsecured credit facilities, or the
issuance of new unsecured debt securities or equity.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our critical accounting policies are those having the most
impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results
and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. These
policies include those related to (1) capital expenditures,
(2) impairment of long-lived assets, and (3) real
estate investment properties. With respect to these critical
accounting policies, we believe that the application of
judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces
financial information that fairly depicts the results of
operations for all periods presented.

Capital Expenditures

In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States, we capitalize those expenditures related to
acquiring new assets, materially enhancing the value of an
existing asset, or substantially extending the useful life of an
existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing
property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as
incurred.

During 2004, $82.4 million or $1,075 per home was
spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities,
excluding development. These capital improvements included
turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and
appliances, other recurring capital expenditures such as HVAC
equipment, roofs, siding, parking lots, and other non-revenue
enhancing capital expenditures, which aggregated
$36.3 million or $473 per home. In addition, revenue
enhancing capital expenditures, kitchen and bath upgrades, and
other extensive interior upgrades totaled $45.9 million or
$599 per home, and major renovations totaled
$0.2 million or $3 per home for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

The following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and
maintenance costs for all of our communities, excluding real
estate under development for the periods presented:

Total capital improvements increased $29.2 million or
$361 per home in 2004 compared to 2003. We will continue to
selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe
will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of
our cost of capital. Recurring capital expenditures during 2005
are currently expected to be approximately $510 per home.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by the future operation and
disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of
those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical
results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market



and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The
net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market
value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best
estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market
rates and transactions.

Real Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time
and allocate the purchase price to various components, such as
land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 141,

“Business
Combinations.”

The purchase price is allocated based on
the relative fair value of each component. The fair value of
buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon
acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As
such, the determination of fair value considers the present
value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the
property including an initial lease up period. We determine the
fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective
rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms
for similar leases at acquisition. In addition, we consider the
cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated
with the lease-up period, and the carrying costs associated with
the lease-up period. The fair value of in-place leases is
recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the
remaining contractual lease period.

Statements of Cash Flow

The following discussion explains the changes in net cash
provided by operating and financing activities and net cash used
in investing activities that are presented in our Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.

Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2004, our net cash flow
provided by operating activities was $251.7 million
compared to $234.9 million for 2003. During 2004, the
increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted
primarily from an increase in property operating income due to
the overall increase in our apartment community portfolio (see
discussion under “Apartment Community Operations”).

Investing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash used in
investing activities was $596.0 million compared to
$304.2 million for 2003. Changes in the level of investing
activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it
relates to our acquisition, capital expenditure, development,
and disposition programs, as well as the impact of the capital
market environment on these activities, all of which are
discussed in further detail below.

Acquisitions

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we acquired 28
apartment communities with 8,060 apartment homes for an
aggregate consideration of $1.0 billion and one parcel of
land for $16.3 million. In 2003, we acquired 3,514
apartment homes in 11 communities for an aggregate consideration
of $347.7 million and one parcel of land for
$3.1 million. In addition, we purchased the remaining 47%
joint venture partners’ ownership interest in nine
communities with 1,706 apartment homes in Salinas and Pacific
Grove, California, for $76.0 million in June 2003.

Our long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating
efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets.
As a result, we have been expanding our interests in the fast
growing Southern California, Florida, and Metropolitan DC
markets over the past two years. During 2005, we plan to
continue to channel new investments into those markets we
believe will provide the best investment returns. Markets will
be targeted based upon defined criteria including past
performance, expected job growth, current and anticipated
housing supply and demand, and the ability to attract and
support household formation.



Real Estate Under Development

Development activity is focused in core markets in which we have
strong operations in place. For the year ended December 31,
2004, we invested approximately $19.1 million in
development projects, an increase of $5.5 million from our 2003
level of $13.6 million.

The following projects were under development as of
December 31, 2004:

In addition, we own eight parcels of land that we continue to
hold for future development that had a carrying value as of
December 31, 2004 of $25.5 million. Four of the eight
parcels represent additional phases to existing communities as
we plan to add apartment homes adjacent to currently owned
communities that are in improving markets.

Disposition of Investments

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold 19
communities with 5,425 apartment homes for an aggregate
consideration of $270.1 million. In addition, we sold 24 of
36 townhomes of a community for $7.3 million. We recognized
gains for financial reporting purposes of $52.9 million on
these sales. Proceeds from the sales were used primarily to
reduce debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, we sold seven
communities with 1,927 apartment homes for an aggregate
consideration of $88.9 million, one parcel of land for
$1.3 million, and two commercial properties for an
aggregate consideration of $7.3 million. We recognized
gains for financial reporting purposes of $15.9 million on
these sales. Proceeds from the sales were used primarily to
reduce debt.

During 2005, we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of
exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and
redeploying capital into markets that would enhance future
growth rates and economies of scale. We intend to use the
proceeds from 2005 dispositions to reduce debt, acquire
communities, and fund development activity.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities during 2004 was
$347.3 million compared to $70.9 million in 2003. As
part of the plan to improve our balance sheet, we utilized
proceeds from dispositions, equity and debt offerings, and
refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, and
purchase new properties.

The following is a summary of our financing activities for the
year ended December 31, 2004:

•

Repaid $131.8 million of secured debt and
    $46.6 million of unsecured debt.

•

Sold $125 million aggregate principal amount of 5.13%
    senior unsecured notes due January 2014 ($75 million in
    January and $50 million in March) under our medium-term note
    program. These notes represent a re-opening of the 5.13% senior
    unsecured notes due January 2014 that we issued in October 2003,
    and these notes constitute a single series of notes, bringing
    the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 5.13% senior
    unsecured notes to $200 million. The net proceeds of





Credit Facilities

We have four secured revolving credit facilities with Fannie Mae
with an aggregate commitment of $860 million and one with
Freddie Mac for $72 million. As of December 31, 2004,
$656.3 million was outstanding under the Fannie Mae credit
facilities leaving $203.7 million of unused capacity. The
Fannie Mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten
years, bear interest at floating and fixed rates, and can be
extended for an additional five years at our discretion. As of
December 31, 2004, $20.7 million had been funded under
the Freddie Mac credit facility leaving $51.3 million of
unused capacity. The Freddie Mac credit facility is for an
initial term of five years with an option for us to extend for
an additional four-year term at the then market rate. As of
December 31, 2004, aggregate borrowings under both the
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit facilities were
$677 million. We have $288.9 million of the funded
balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 6.4%. The
remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted
average variable rate of 2.7%.

We have a $500 million three-year unsecured revolving
credit facility that matures in March 2006. If we receive
commitments from additional lenders or if the initial lenders
increase their commitments, we will be able to increase the
credit facility to $650 million. At our option, the credit
facility can be extended one year to March 2007. Based on our
current credit ratings, the credit facility bears interest at a
rate equal to LIBOR plus 90 basis points. As of
December 31, 2004, $278.1 million was outstanding
under the credit facility leaving $221.9 million of unused
capacity.

The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit facilities and the bank
revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial
covenants and limitations.

Derivative Instruments

As part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy,
we have used derivatives as a means to fix the interest rates of
variable rate debt obligations or to hedge anticipated financing
transactions. Our derivative transactions used for interest rate
risk management included various interest rate swaps with
indices that related to the pricing of specific financial
instruments of the company. We believe that we appropriately
controlled our interest rate risk through the use of derivative
instruments. During 2004, the fair value of our derivative
instruments improved from an unfavorable $1.6 million at
December 31, 2003, to $0 at December 31, 2004. This
decrease was due to the normal progression of the fair market
value of our derivative instruments towards zero as they
matured. As of December 31, 2004, all of United
Dominion’s interest rate swap agreements had matured.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable
rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced.
United Dominion does not hold financial instruments for trading
or other speculative purposes, but rather issues these financial
instruments to finance its portfolio of real estate assets.
Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in
market interest rates and the fair value of market rate
sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as
changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable
rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. A large portion of our
market risk is exposure to short-term interest rates from
variable rate borrowings outstanding under our Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac credit facilities and our bank revolving credit
facility, which totaled $388.1 million and $278.1 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2004. The impact on our
financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured
during 2004 was immaterial.

If market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100
basis points more in 2005 than they did during 2004, our
interest expense would increase, and income before taxes would
decrease by $7.4 million. Comparatively, if market interest
rates for variable rate debt had averaged 100 basis points more
in 2004 than in 2003, our interest expense would have increased,
and net income would have decreased by $5.8 million. If
market rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points higher at
December 31, 2004, the fair value of fixed rate debt would
have remained constant at $2.1 billion. If market interest
rates for fixed



rate debt were 100 basis points lower at December 31, 2004,
the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from
$2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of
hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These
analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of
overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment. Further, in the event of a change of such
magnitude, management would likely take actions to further
mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the
uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and
their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no
change in our financial structure.

Funds from Operations

Funds from operations, or FFO, is defined as net income
(computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of
depreciable property, plus real estate depreciation and
amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures. We compute FFO for all periods
presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by
the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s
(“NAREIT”) April 1, 2002 White Paper. We consider
FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating
performance, and believe that FFO should be considered along
with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as
a measure of our activities in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. FFO does not represent cash
generated from operating activities in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative
of cash available to fund cash needs.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles implicitly assumes
that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over
time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen
or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and
analysts have considered the presentation of operating results
for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to
be insufficient by themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a
supplemental measure of REIT operating performance and defines
FFO as net income (computed in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding
gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus
depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The use of FFO,
combined with the required presentations, has been fundamentally
beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results of
REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT
operating results more meaningful. We generally consider FFO to
be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and
financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in
conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of
performance) because by excluding gains or losses related to
sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and
excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO
can help one compare the operating performance of a
company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
different companies. We believe that FFO is the best measure of
economic profitability for real estate investment trusts.



The following table outlines our FFO calculation and
reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles for
the three years ended December 31, 2004 (

dollars in
thousands

):

In the computation of diluted FFO, OP Units, out-performance
partnership shares, and the shares of Series D Cumulative
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and Series E
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive; therefore,
they are included in the diluted share count. For the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, distributions to
preferred stockholders exclude $5.7 million and
$19.3 million, respectively, related to premiums on
preferred stock conversions.

Gains on the disposition of real estate investments developed
for sale is defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision
(such development by REITs must be conducted in a taxable REIT
subsidiary) and the gross investment basis of the asset before
accumulated depreciation. We consider FFO with gains (or losses)
on real estate developed for sale to be a meaningful
supplemental measure of performance because of the short-term
use of funds to produce a profit that differs from the
traditional long-term investment in real estate for REITs.

disposition of real estate developed for sale to gross gains on

FFO also does not represent cash generated from operating
activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and therefore should not be considered an
alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as
determined by generally accepted accounting principles, as a
measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily
indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs. A

Results of Operations

The following discussion includes the results of both continuing
and discontinued operations for the periods presented.

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

2004-vs.-2003

Net income available to common stockholders was
$71.9 million ($0.56 per diluted share) for the year ended
December 31, 2004, compared to $24.8 million ($0.22
per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2003,
representing an increase of $47.1 million ($0.34 per
diluted share). The increase for the year ended
December 31, 2004, when compared to the same period in
2003, resulted primarily from the following items, all of which
are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

$37.0 million more in gains recognized from the sale of
    depreciable property in 2004,

•

a $19.2 million increase in operating results in 2004,

•

a $13.5 million decrease in premiums paid on preferred
    stock conversions in 2004,



These increases in income were partially offset by a
$17.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization
expense, a $6.6 million increase in interest expense, and a
charge of $5.5 million for hurricane related expenses in
2004 when compared to 2003.

2003-vs.-2002

Net income available to common stockholders was
$24.8 million ($0.21 per diluted share) for the year ended
December 31, 2003, compared to $25.8 million ($0.24
per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2002,
representing a decrease of $1.0 million ($0.03 per diluted
share). The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2003,
when compared to the same period in 2002, resulted primarily
from the following items, all of which are discussed in further
detail elsewhere within this Report:

These decreases in income were offset by $37.0 million less
in prepayment penalties and premiums paid in 2003 for the
refinancing of mortgage debt and the repurchase of unsecured
debt, a $15.8 million decrease in interest expense in 2003,
and a $2.3 million impairment charge taken in 2002 related
to a portfolio of properties in Memphis, Tennessee.

The following table is our reconciliation of property operating
income to net income as reflected on the Consolidated Statements
of Operations for the periods presented (

dollars in
thousands

):

2004-vs.-2003

Same Communities

Our same communities (those communities acquired, developed, and
stabilized prior to December 31, 2003 and held on
December 31, 2004, which consisted of 62,497 apartment
homes) provided 78% of our property operating income for the
year ended December 31, 2004.

For 2004, same community property operating income decreased
1.2% or $3.9 million compared to 2003. The overall decrease in
property operating income was primarily attributable to a 0.5%
or $2.3 million increase in revenues from rental and other
income that was offset by a 3.2% or $6.2 million increase
in operating expenses. The increase in revenues from rental and
other income was primarily driven by a 7.7% or $2.8 million
decrease in vacancy loss and a 14.3% or $2.1 million
increase in utility reimbursement income. These increases in
income were offset by a 0.7% or $3.6 million decrease in
rental rates. Physical occupancy increased 0.8% to 93.8%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
by a 5.4% or $2.8 million increase in personnel costs, a
4.7% or $1.5 million increase in repair and maintenance
costs, a 3.5% or $1.1 million increase in utilities
expense, and a 1.6% or $0.8 million increase in property
taxes.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
operating income divided by property rental income) decreased
1.0% to 61.0%.

Non-Mature Communities

The remaining 22% of our property operating income during 2004
was generated from communities that we classify as
“non-mature communities” (primarily those communities
acquired or developed during 2003 and 2004, sold properties, and
those properties classified as real estate held for
disposition). The 39 communities with 11,574 apartment homes
that we acquired during 2003 and 2004 provided
$45.8 million of property operating income. The 19
communities with 5,425 apartment homes sold during 2004 provided
$14.4 million of property operating income. In addition, our
development communities, which included 178 apartment homes
constructed since January 1, 2003, provided
$1.0 million of property operating income during 2004, the
12 communities with 2,635 apartment homes classified as real
estate held for disposition provided $11.3 million of
property operating income, and other non-mature communities
provided $13.5 million of property operating income for the
year ended December 31, 2004.



2003-vs.-2002

Same Communities

Our same communities (those communities acquired, developed, and
stabilized prior to January 1, 2002 and held on
December 31, 2003, which consisted of 67,814 apartment
homes) provided 89% of our property operating income for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

For 2003, same community property operating income decreased
4.2% or $14.9 million compared to 2002. The overall decrease in
property operating income was primarily attributable to a 1.8%
or $9.9 million decrease in revenues from rental and other
income and a 2.5% or $5.0 million increase in operating
expenses. The decrease in revenues from rental and other income
was primarily driven by a 2.2% or $12.8 million decrease in
rental rates. This decrease in income was partially offset by an
11.7% or $1.7 million increase in sub-meter, gas, trash,
and utility reimbursements, a 5.5% or $1.0 million decrease
in concession expense, and a 1.7% or $0.7 million decrease
in vacancy loss. Physical occupancy remained constant at 93.2%
for both 2003 and 2002.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
by a 17.6% or $1.7 million increase in insurance costs, a
4.3% or $1.4 million increase in utilities expense, a 2.4%
or $0.9 million increase in repair and maintenance costs, a
3.9% or $0.8 million increase in administrative and
marketing costs, a 0.7% or $0.4 million increase in
personnel costs, and a 0.8% or $0.4 million increase in
taxes, all of which were partially offset by a 17.6% or
$0.2 million decrease in incentive compensation.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
and property operating expenses, the operating margin decreased
1.6% to 61.7%.

Non-Mature Communities

The remaining 11% of our property operating income during 2003
was generated from communities that we classify as
“non-mature communities” (primarily those communities
acquired or developed during 2002 and 2003, sold properties, and
those properties classified as real estate held for
disposition). The 21 communities with 6,935 apartment homes that
we acquired during 2002 and 2003 provided $30.6 million of
property operating income. The seven communities with 1,927
apartment homes sold during 2003 provided $4.6 million of
property operating income. In addition, our development
communities, which included 972 apartment homes constructed
since January 1, 2002, provided $4.8 million of
property operating income during 2003, the one community with
100 apartment homes classified as real estate held for
disposition provided $0.7 million of property operating
income, and other non-mature communities provided
$1.7 million of property operating income for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2004, real estate
depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
discontinued operations increased $17.2 million or 10.5%
compared to 2003, primarily due to the overall increase in the
weighted average number of apartment homes and a significant
increase in the per home acquisition cost compared to the
existing portfolio, and other capital expenditures.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, real estate
depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
discontinued operations increased $4.2 million or 2.7% compared
to 2002, regardless of the decrease in the weighted average
number of apartment homes experienced from December 31,
2002 to December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due
to the newly acquired properties having a significantly higher
per home cost compared to those properties that were disposed
of, and other capital expenditures.

Interest Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2004, interest expense on
both continuing and discontinued operations increased
$6.6 million or 5.6% from 2003 primarily due to the
issuance of debt. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased 21.2% or



$435.9 million compared to the prior year. However, this
was partially offset by the weighted average interest rate
declining from 5.4% to 5.0% during 2004. The weighted average
amount of debt outstanding during 2004 is higher than 2003 as
acquisition costs in 2004 have been funded, in most part, by the
issuance of debt. The decrease in the weighted average interest
rate during 2004 reflects our ability to take advantage of lower
interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of
variable rate debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, interest expense on
both continuing and discontinued operations decreased
$15.8 million or 11.9% from 2002 primarily due to debt
refinancings, decreasing interest rates, and an overall decrease
in the weighted average level of debt outstanding. For the year
ended December 31, 2003, the weighted average amount of
debt outstanding decreased 1.1% or $23.9 million compared
to the prior year and the weighted average interest rate
decreased from 6.1% to 5.4% during 2003. The weighted average
amount of debt outstanding during 2003 is lower than 2002
primarily due to the high acquisition volume at the beginning of
2002 that was subsequently mitigated by high disposition
activity in the second half of 2002. Furthermore, acquisition
costs in 2003 that exceeded disposition proceeds were funded, in
most part, by equity and OP Unit issuances. The decrease in the
average interest rate during 2003 reflects our ability to take
advantage of declining interest rates through refinancing and
the utilization of variable rate debt.

General and Administrative

For the year ended December 31, 2004, general and
administrative expenses decreased $1.3 million or 6.4% over
2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in
investor relations, legal and consulting expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, general and
administrative expenses increased $1.3 million or 6.6% over
2002 primarily due to an increase in restricted stock
compensation. Over the past two years, United Dominion has
shifted its long-term incentive reward system from stock options
to restricted stock, the cost of which is expensed monthly
during the vesting period.

Hurricane Related Expenses

In 2004, we recognized a $5.5 million charge to cover
expenses associated with the damage in Florida caused by
hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne. United Dominion
reported that 25 of its 34 Florida communities were affected by
the hurricanes.

Impairment Loss on Real Estate and Investments

In 2003, we recognized a $1.4 million charge for the
write-off of our investment in Realeum, Inc., an unconsolidated
development joint venture created to develop web-based solutions
for multifamily property and portfolio management.

Gains on Sales of Land and Depreciable Property

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we
recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of
$52.9 million and $15.9 million, respectively. Changes
in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect
the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to
period as well as the extent of gains related to specific
properties sold.

Premium on Preferred Stock Conversions

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we exercised our right to redeem
2 million shares of our Series D Cumulative
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of our
redemption notice, the shares to be redeemed were converted by
the holder into 3,076,769 shares of common stock at a price of
$16.25 per share. As a result, we recognized a $5.7 million
premium on preferred stock conversions.

In the second quarter of 2003, we exercised our right to redeem
2 million shares of our Series D Cumulative
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of our
redemption notice, the shares to



be redeemed were converted by the holder into 3,076,923 shares
of common stock at a price of $16.25 per share. In December
2003, we exercised our right to redeem an additional 4 million
shares of our Series D. Upon receipt of our redemption
notice, the shares to be redeemed were converted by the holder
into 6,154,000 shares of common stock at a price of $16.25 per
share. As a result, we recognized a $19.3 million premium
on preferred stock conversions during 2003.

The premium amount recognized to convert these shares represents
the cumulative accretion to date between the conversion value of
the preferred stock and the value at which it was recorded at
the time of issuance.

eBay Purchase of Rent.com

On December 16, 2004, eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) announced that it
had agreed to acquire privately held Rent.com, a leading
Internet listing web site in the apartment and rental housing
industry, for approximately $415 million plus acquisition
costs, net of Rent.com’s cash on hand. On February 23,
2005, eBay announced that it had completed the acquisition. We
own shares in Rent.com, and as a result of the transaction, we
recorded a one-time pre-tax gain of $12.3 million on the
sale.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
operations have been immaterial. Substantially all of our leases
are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our
risk from the adverse effects of inflation.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or
are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material.

of our operations, some of which are beyond our control. These
factors include:

•

unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions
    that could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates,

•

the failure of acquisitions to achieve anticipated results,

•

possible difficulty in selling apartment communities,

Controls and Procedures

Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2004, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures
are designed with the objective of ensuring that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting them to material information required to be included in
our periodic SEC reports. In addition, our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that during
the year ended December 31, 2004, there has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our
internal control over financial reporting is designed with the
objective of providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of our financial reporting and preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.



It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective under
circumstances where our disclosure controls and procedures
should reasonably be expected to operate effectively.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Board of Directors and Stockholders

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting included at Item 9A, that United Dominion Realty
Trust, Inc. (the “Company”) maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2004 of United
Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and our report dated March 2,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Stockholders

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. (the “Company”) as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
March 2, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

DECEMBER 31, 2004

1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and formation

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was
formed in 1972. United Dominion operates within one defined
business segment with activities related to the ownership,
management, development, acquisition, renovation, and
disposition of multifamily apartment communities nationwide. At
December 31, 2004, United Dominion owned 273 communities
with 78,855 completed apartment homes and had three communities
with 807 apartment homes under development.

Basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of United Dominion and its subsidiaries, including
United Dominion Realty, L.P., (the “Operating
Partnership”), and Heritage Communities L.P. (the
“Heritage OP”), (collectively, “United
Dominion”). As of December 31, 2004, there were
166,061,749 units in the Operating Partnership outstanding, of
which 156,037,369 units or 94.0% were owned by United Dominion
and 10,024,380 units or 6.0% were owned by limited partners (of
which 1,791,329 and 0 are owned by the holders of the
Series A OPPS and the Series B OPPS, respectively, see
below and Note 9). As of December 31, 2004, there were
5,542,200 units in the Heritage OP outstanding, of which
5,186,945 units or 93.6% were owned by United Dominion and
355,255 units or 6.4% were owned by limited partners. The
consolidated financial statements of United Dominion include the
minority interests of the unitholders in the Operating
Partnership and the Heritage OP. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Income taxes

United Dominion is operated as, and elects to be taxed as, a
real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”). Generally, a REIT complies with the
provisions of the Code if it meets certain requirements
concerning its income and assets, as well as if it distributes
at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and
will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes if it
distributes at least 100% of its income. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal income taxes of the REIT.
United Dominion’s taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to
federal corporate income taxes, based upon their respective
taxable incomes. The taxable REIT subsidiaries have no material
permanent or temporary differences that would require a
provision for federal income tax. Additionally, United Dominion
is subject to certain state and local excise or franchise taxes,
for which provision has been made.

The differences between net income available to common
stockholders for financial reporting purposes and taxable income
before dividend deductions relate primarily to temporary
differences, principally real estate depreciation and the tax
deferral of certain gains on property sales. The differences in
depreciation result from differences in the book and tax basis
of certain real estate assets and the differences in the methods
of depreciation and lives of the real estate assets. The
aggregate cost of our real estate assets for federal income tax
purposes was approximately $4.5 billion at
December 31, 2004.

Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Real estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical
cost less accumulated depreciation and any recorded impairment
losses.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are
charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements,
renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition and/or
improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the value of
the existing asset will be materially enhanced or the life of
the related asset will be substantially extended beyond the
original life expectancy.

United Dominion recognizes impairment losses on long-lived
assets used in operations when there is an event or change in
circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of an
asset and the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient
to recover the asset’s carrying value. Our cash flow
estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect
our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and
our estimated holding periods. If such indicators of impairment
are present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the
excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value.



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate
based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and
transactions.

United Dominion purchases real estate investment properties from
time to time and allocates the purchase price to various
components, such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to
in-place leases in accordance with FASB Statement No. 141,

“Business Combinations.”

The purchase price is
allocated based on the relative fair value of each component.
The fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings
were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market
rental rates. As such, the determination of fair value considers
the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated
from the property including an initial lease up period. United
Dominion determines the fair value of in-place leases by
assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease
relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. The
fair value of in-place leases is recorded and amortized as
amortization expense over the remaining contractual lease
period. United Dominion determines the fair value of in-place
leases by considering the cost of acquiring similar leases, the
foregone rents associated with the lease-up period, and the
carrying costs associated with the lease-up period.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are
recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost
to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties
classified as real estate held for disposition generally
represent properties that are under contract for sale. Real
estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of cost, net
of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less the cost to
dispose, determined on an asset by asset basis. Expenditures for
ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for disposition
properties are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for
improvements, renovations, and replacements related to held for
disposition properties are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is
not recorded on real estate held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets which is
35 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major
improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures,
equipment, and other assets. The value of acquired in-place
leases is amortized over the remaining term of each acquired
in-place lease.

All development projects and related carrying costs are
capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
“Real estate under development.” As each building in a
project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the
total cost of the building is transferred to real estate held
for investment and the assets are depreciated over their
estimated useful lives. The cost of development projects
includes interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated
development overhead during the construction period.

Interest, real estate taxes, and incremental labor and support
costs for personnel working directly on the development site are
capitalized as part of the real estate under development to the
extent that such charges do not cause the carrying value of the
asset to exceed its net realizable value. During 2004, 2003, and
2002, total interest capitalized was $1.0 million,
$1.8 million, and $0.9 million, respectively.

Cash equivalents

Cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less when purchased.

Restricted cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for
real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and
security deposits.



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Deferred financing costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and other external costs
incurred to obtain debt financings and are generally amortized
on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective
interest method, over a period not to exceed the term of the
related debt. Unamortized financing costs are written-off when
debt is retired before its maturity date. During 2004, 2003, and
2002, amortization expense was $5.1 million,
$4.7 million, and $4.5 million, respectively.

Investments in unconsolidated development joint ventures

Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for
using the equity method when major business decisions require
approval by the other partners and United Dominion does not have
control of the assets. Investments are recorded at cost and
subsequently adjusted for equity in net income (loss) and
cash contributions and distributions. United Dominion eliminates
intercompany profits on sales of services that are provided to
joint ventures. Differences between the carrying value of
investments and the underlying equity in net assets of the
investee are due to capitalized interest on the investment
balance and capitalized development and leasing costs that are
recovered by United Dominion through fees during construction.

Revenue recognition

United Dominion’s apartment homes are leased under
operating leases with terms generally of one year or less.
Rental income is recognized after it is earned and
collectibility is reasonably assured.

Advertising costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on
the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item
“Administrative and marketing.” During 2004, 2003, and
2002, total advertising expense was $10.5 million,
$10.6 million, and $11.0 million, respectively.

Interest rate swap agreements

United Dominion accounts for its derivative instruments in
accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133 and No. 138,

“Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

At
December 31, 2004, United Dominion has no derivative
financial instruments reported on its Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Prior to their maturity, United Dominion’s
derivative financial instruments consisted of interest rate swap
agreements that were designated as cash flow hedges of debt with
variable interest rate features, and as qualifying hedges for
financial reporting purposes. For a derivative instrument that
qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the
gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into
earnings during the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss
on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change
in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item, if
any, is recognized in current earnings during the period of
change.

As part of United Dominion’s overall interest rate risk
management strategy, we used derivative financial instruments as
a means to artificially fix variable rate debt or to hedge
anticipated financing transactions. United Dominion’s
derivative transactions used for interest rate risk management
included various interest rate swaps with indices that related
to the pricing of specific financial instruments of United
Dominion. Because of the close correlation between the hedging
instrument and the underlying cash flow exposure being hedged,
fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments were
generally offset by changes in the cash flow of the underlying
exposures. As a result, United Dominion appropriately controlled
the risk so that derivatives used for interest rate risk
management would not have a material

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

unintended effect on consolidated earnings. United Dominion does
not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes.

The fair value of United Dominion’s derivative instruments
were reported on the balance sheet at their current fair value.
The estimated fair value for our interest rate swaps relied on
prevailing market interest rates. The interest rate swap
agreements were designated with all or a portion of the
principal balance and term of a specific debt obligation. Each
interest rate swap involved the periodic exchange of payments
over the life of the related agreement. An amount received or
paid on the interest rate swap was recorded on an accrual basis
as an adjustment to the related interest expense of the
outstanding debt based on the accrual method of accounting. The
related amount payable to and receivable from counterparties was
included in other liabilities and other assets, respectively.

When the terms of the underlying transaction were modified, or
when the underlying hedged item ceased to exist, all changes in
the fair value of the instrument were marked-to-market with
changes in value included in net income each period until the
instrument matured, unless the instrument was redesignated as a
hedge of another transaction. If a derivative instrument was
terminated or the hedging transaction was no longer determined
to be effective, amounts held in accumulated other comprehensive
income were reclassified into earnings over the term of the
future cash outflows on the related debt.

Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in equity
during each period except for those resulting from investments
by or distributions to stockholders, is displayed in the
accompanying Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Other
comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains or losses from
derivative financial instruments.

Stock-based employee compensation plans

United Dominion adopted the fair-value-based method of
accounting for share-based payments effective January 1,
2004 using the prospective method described in FASB Statement
No. 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.”

Currently, United Dominion uses the Black-Scholes-Merton formula
to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and
expects to continue to use this acceptable option valuation
model upon the required adoption of Statement 123R on
July 1, 2005. Because Statement 123R must be applied not
only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not
fully vested on the effective date, and because United Dominion
adopted Statement 123 using the prospective transition method
(which applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after
the adoption date), compensation cost for some previously
granted awards that were not recognized under Statement 123 will
be recognized under Statement 123R. However, had United Dominion
adopted Statement 123R in prior periods, the impact of the
standard would have approximated the impact of Statement 123 as
described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings
per share in Note 8 to our consolidated financial
statements.

Minority interests in operating partnerships

Interests in operating partnerships held by limited partners are
represented by operating partnership units (“OP
Units”). The operating partnerships’ income is
allocated to holders of OP Units based upon net income available
to common stockholders and the weighted average number of OP
Units outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units
outstanding during the period. Capital contributions,
distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to minority
interests in accordance with the terms of the individual
partnership agreements. OP Units can be exchanged for cash or
shares of United Dominion’s common stock on a one-for-one
basis, at the option of United Dominion. OP Units, as a
percentage of total OP



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Units and shares outstanding, were 6.3% at December 31,
2004, 6.4% at December 31, 2003, and 6.2% at
December 31, 2002.

During 2003, we issued 1,617,815 Preferred Operating Partnership
Units (“Preferred OP Units”) totaling
$26.9 million as partial consideration for the purchase of
four communities. The Preferred OP Units carry a fixed coupon of
8.0% until such time as the common share dividend is equal to or
exceeds this amount for four consecutive quarters, at which time
the Preferred OP Units will be entitled to receive dividends
equivalent to the dividend paid to holders of common stock.

Minority interests in other partnerships

United Dominion has limited partners in certain real estate
partnerships acquired in certain merger transactions. Net income
for these partnerships is allocated based upon the percentage
interest owned by these limited partners in each respective real
estate partnership.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per common share is computed based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based upon
common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive stock
options and other potentially dilutive common stock equivalents.
The dilutive effect of stock options and other potentially
dilutive common stock equivalents is determined using the
treasury stock method based on United Dominion’s average
stock price.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted earning per share

(dollars in thousands, except per
share amounts)

:

The effect of the conversion of the operating partnership units,
Series A Out-Performance Partnership Units, and convertible
preferred stock is not dilutive and is therefore not included as
a dilutive security in the earnings per share computation. The
weighted average effect of the conversion of the operating
partnership units for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003, and 2002 was 10,460,639 shares, 9,690,883 shares, and
8,577,918 shares, respectively. The weighted average effect of
the conversion of the Series A Out-Performance Partnership
Units for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002
was 1,791,329 shares, 1,853,204 shares, and 1,568,000 shares,
respectively. The weighted average effect of the conversion

of the convertible preferred stock for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 was 6,301,821 shares,

2.     REAL ESTATE OWNED

United Dominion operates in 43 markets dispersed throughout 17
states. At December 31, 2004, our largest apartment market
was Southern California, where we owned 18.5% of our apartment
homes, based upon carrying value. Excluding Southern California,
United Dominion did not own more than 4.9% of its apartment
homes in any one market, based upon carrying value.

United Dominion is pursuing its strategy of exiting markets
where it views long-term growth prospects as limited and
believes the redeployment of capital would enhance future growth
rates and economies of scale. During the first quarter of 2002,
United Dominion placed nine assets, with an aggregate net book
value of $89.3 million, under contract for sale and
reclassified them as real estate held for disposition. These
sales closed in the second quarter of 2002 and resulted in our
withdrawal from Naples, Florida; Tucson, Arizona; Las Vegas,
Nevada; and substantially all of Memphis, Tennessee. Although
these sales resulted in an aggregate net gain of
$11.5 million, certain of these assets were sold at net
selling prices below their net book values at March 31,
2002. As a result, United Dominion recorded an aggregate
$2.3 million impairment loss in 2002 for the write down of
a portfolio of five apartment communities in Memphis, Tennessee.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

United Dominion adopted FASB Statement No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,”

(FAS 144) as of January 1, 2002. FAS 144
requires, among other things, that the primary assets and
liabilities and the results of operations of United
Dominion’s real properties which have been sold subsequent
to January 1, 2002, or are held for disposition subsequent
to January 1, 2002, be classified as discontinued
operations and segregated in United Dominion’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets. Properties
classified as real estate held for disposition generally
represent properties that are under contract for sale and are
expected to close within the next twelve months. For purposes of
these financial statements, FAS 144 results in the presentation
of the primary assets and liabilities and the net operating
results of those properties sold or classified as held for
disposition through December 31, 2004, as discontinued
operations for all periods presented. The adoption of FAS 144
does not have an impact on net income available to common
stockholders. FAS 144 only results in the reclassification of
the operating results of all properties sold or classified as
held for disposition through December 31, 2004 within the
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, and the reclassification
of the assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, United Dominion sold
19 communities with a total of 5,425 apartment homes, 24
townhomes from a community of 36 townhomes, and one parcel of
land. At December 31, 2004, United Dominion had 12
communities with a total of 2,635 apartment homes and a net book
value of $114.9 million and one parcel of land with a net
book value of $3.9 million included in real estate held for
disposition. During 2003, United Dominion sold seven communities
with a total of 1,927 apartment homes and two commercial
properties. During 2002, United Dominion sold 25 communities
with a total of 6,990 apartment homes, one parcel of land, and
one commercial property. The results of operations for these
properties and the interest expense associated with the secured
debt on these properties are classified on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations in the line item entitled “Income
from discontinued operations, net of minority interests.”

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Preferred Stock

The Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock has no
stated par value and a liquidation preference of $25 per share.
The Series B has no voting rights except as required by
law. The Series B has no stated maturity and is not subject
to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not
convertible into any of our other securities. The Series B
is not redeemable prior to May 29, 2007. On or after this
date, the Series B may be redeemed for cash at our option,
in whole or in part, at a redemption price of $25 per share plus
accrued and unpaid dividends. The redemption price is payable
solely out of the sale proceeds of other capital stock. All
dividends due and payable on the Series B have been accrued
or paid as of the end of each fiscal year.

Distributions declared on the Series B in 2004 were $2.15
per share or $0.5375 per quarter. The Series B is listed on
the NYSE under the symbol “UDRpfb.” At
December 31, 2004, a total of 5,416,009 shares of the
Series B were outstanding.

All of the remaining outstanding shares of our Series D
Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock have been
converted by the holder into shares of our common stock. The
Series D had no stated maturity, no stated par value, no
voting rights except as required by law, and a liquidation
preference of $25 per share. The Series D was convertible
at any time into 1.5385 shares of common stock, subject to
certain adjustments, at the option of the holder of the
Series D. We had the option to redeem at any time all or
part of the Series D at a price per share of $25, payable
in cash, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, provided that
the current market price of our common stock was at least equal
to the conversion price, initially set at $16.25 per share.

In 2004, United Dominion exercised its right to redeem the
remaining 2 million shares of Series D that were
outstanding. Upon receipt of our redemption notice, the shares
to be redeemed were converted by the holder into 3,076,769
shares of common stock at a price of $16.25 per share. In 2003,
we exercised our right to redeem 6 million shares of our
Series D. Upon receipt of our redemption notice, the
6 million shares to be redeemed were converted by the
holder into 9,230,923 shares of common stock at a price of
$16.25 per share. As a result, United Dominion recognized
$5.7 million and $19.3 million in premium on preferred
stock conversions in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The premium
amount recognized to convert



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

these shares represents the cumulative accretion to date between
the conversion value of the preferred stock and the value at
which it was recorded at the time of issuance.

Distributions declared on the Series D in 2004 were $2.09
per share or $0.5223 per quarter. The Series D was not
listed on an exchange. At December 31, 2004, there were no
outstanding shares of the Series D.

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock has no
stated par value and a liquidation preference of $16.61 per
share. Subject to certain adjustments and conditions, each share
of the Series E is convertible at any time and from time to
time at the holder’s option into one share of our common
stock. The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on
an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the
holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for
the election of directors or for any other purpose on which the
holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E has
no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or any
mandatory redemption.

In 2004, Series E holders converted a total of 621,405
shares of Series E into 621,405 shares of our common stock.

Distributions declared on the Series E in 2004 were $1.33
per share or $0.3322 per quarter. The Series E is not
listed on any exchange. At December 31, 2004, a total of
2,803,812 shares of the Series E were outstanding.

Officers’ Stock Purchase and Loan Plan

United Dominion’s notes receivable from certain officers
matured in June 2004 and were satisfied in accordance with their
terms. The purpose of the loans was for the borrowers to
purchase shares of United Dominion’s common stock pursuant
to United Dominion’s 1991 Stock Purchase and Loan Plan. The
loans were evidenced by promissory notes between the borrowers
and United Dominion and secured by a pledge of the shares of
common stock.

In addition, United Dominion had entered into a Servicing and
Purchase Agreement (the “Servicing Agreement”) with
SunTrust Bank (the “Bank”) whereby United Dominion
acted as servicing agent for and to purchase certain loans made
by the Bank to officers and directors of United Dominion (the
“Borrowers”) to finance the purchase of shares of
United Dominion’s common stock. The loans were evidenced by
promissory notes (“Notes”) between each Borrower and
the Bank. The Servicing Agreement provided that the Bank could
require United Dominion to purchase the Notes upon an event of
default by the Borrower or United Dominion under the Servicing
Agreement and at certain other times during the term of the
Servicing Agreement. All of the Notes matured in June 2004 and
were satisfied in accordance with their terms.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

United Dominion’s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows common and
preferred stockholders the opportunity to purchase, through the
reinvestment of cash dividends, additional shares of United
Dominion’s common stock. As of December 31, 2004,
9,793,191 shares of common stock had been issued under the Stock

Restricted Stock Awards

United Dominion’s 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“LTIP”) authorizes the grant of restricted stock
awards to employees, officers, consultants, and directors of
United Dominion. Deferred compensation expense is recorded over
the vesting period and is based upon the value of the common
stock on the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2004,
682,460 shares of restricted stock have been issued under the
LTIP.

Shareholder Rights Plan

United Dominion’s 1998 Shareholder Rights Plan is intended
to protect long-term interests of stockholders in the event of
an unsolicited, coercive or unfair attempt to take over United
Dominion. The plan authorized a dividend of one Preferred Share
Purchase Right (the “Rights”) on each share of common
stock outstanding. Each Right, which is not currently
exercisable, will entitle the holder to purchase 1/1000 of a
share of a new series of United Dominion’s preferred stock,
to be designated as Series C Junior Participating
Cumulative Preferred Stock, at a price to be determined upon the
occurrence of the event, and for which the holder must be paid
$45 should the takeover occur. Under the Plan, the rights will
be exercisable if a person or group acquires more than 15% of
United Dominion’s common stock or announces a tender offer
that would result in the ownership of 15% of United
Dominion’s common stock.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following estimated fair values of financial instruments
were determined by United Dominion using available market
information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and
develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the estimates
presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts
United Dominion would realize on the disposition of the
financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions
or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts. The carrying amounts and estimated
fair value of United Dominion’s financial instruments as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, are summarized as follows

The following methods and assumptions were used by United

Cash equivalents

The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Notes receivable

In April 2004, United Dominion received a promissory note in the
principal amount of $75.6 million that matured in December
2004. The note was received in connection with the sale of a
portfolio of properties. In August 2003, United Dominion
received a promissory note in the principal amount of $8 million
that was due September 2006. The note was secured by a second
lien on a property that United Dominion managed and had an
option to purchase. As of December 31, 2004, United
Dominion had received all proceeds on this note. In June 2003,
United Dominion received a promissory note in the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

principal amount of $5 million that is due October 2011.
The note was received in connection with one of our acquisitions
and bears interest of 9.0% that is payable in annual
installments. The carrying amount of the note receivable
approximates fair value.

Secured and unsecured debt

Estimated fair value is based on mortgage rates, tax-exempt bond
rates, and corporate unsecured debt rates believed to be
available to United Dominion for the issuance of debt with
similar terms and remaining lives. The carrying amount of United
Dominion’s variable rate secured debt approximates fair
value as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The carrying
amounts of United Dominion’s borrowings under variable rate
unsecured debt arrangements, short-term revolving credit
agreements, and lines of credit approximate their fair values as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Derivative financial instruments

At December 31, 2004, United Dominion has no derivative
financial instruments reported on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.

For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
United Dominion recognized $1.9 million, $8.1 million,
and $4.9 million, respectively, of unrealized gains in
comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
United Dominion recognized a loss of $0.2 million in net
income related to the ineffective portion of United
Dominion’s hedging instruments. For the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, United Dominion recognized
$0.3 million and $0.05 million in realized gains,
respectively, in net income related to the ineffective portion
of United Dominions hedging instruments. In addition, United
Dominion recognized $1.6 million of derivative financial
instrument liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within
the line item “Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and
other liabilities” for the year ended December 31, 2003.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Profit Sharing Plan

The United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan (the
“Plan”) is a defined contribution plan covering all
eligible full-time employees. Under the Plan, United Dominion
makes discretionary profit sharing and matching contributions to
the Plan as determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors. Aggregate provisions for contributions, both
matching and discretionary, which are included in United
Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 were
$0.6 million, $0.3 million, and $0.4 million,
respectively.

Stock Option Plan

In May 2001, the stockholders of United Dominion approved the
1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”), which
supersedes the 1985 Stock Option Plan. With the approval of the
LTIP, no additional grants will be made under the 1985 Stock
Option Plan. The LTIP authorizes the granting of awards which
may take the form of options to purchase shares of common stock,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, dividend
equivalents, other stock-based awards, and any other right or
interest relating to common stock or cash. The Board of
Directors reserved 4 million shares for issuance upon the
grant or exercise of awards under the LTIP. The LTIP generally
provides, among other things, that options are granted at
exercise prices not lower than the market value of the shares on
the date of grant and that options granted must be exercised
within ten years. The maximum number of shares of stock that may
be issued subject to incentive stock options is 4 million
shares. Shares under options that expire or are cancelable are
available for subsequent grant.

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per
share is required for periods prior to the adoption of the
fair-value-based accounting method by FASB Statement
No. 123

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”

(FAS 123), and has been determined as if
United Dominion had accounted for its employee stock options
under the fair value method of accounting as defined in FAS 123.
The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of
grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions for 2002:

A summary of United Dominion’s stock option activity during
the three years ended December 31, 2004 is provided in the

exercise prices between $9.63 and $10.88, 689,129 of share
options had exercise prices between $11.15 and $12.23, and
490,817 of share options had exercise prices between $13.76 and
$15.38.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, stock-based awards for
2,890,251 and 3,028,920 shares of common stock, respectively,
were available for future grants under the 1999 LTIP’s
existing authorization.

Contingencies

Series B Out-Performance Program

In May 2003, the stockholders of United Dominion approved the
Series B Out-Performance Program (the “Series B
Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers of
United Dominion (the “Participants”) were given the
opportunity to invest indirectly in United Dominion by
purchasing interests in a limited liability company (the
“Series B LLC”), the only asset of which is a
special class of partnership units of United Dominion Realty,
L.P. (“Series B Out-Performance Partnership
Shares” or “Series B OPPSs”) . The purchase
price for the Series B OPPSs was determined by United
Dominion’s board of directors to be $1 million,
assuming 100% participation, and was based upon the advice of an
independent valuation expert. The Series B Program will
measure the cumulative total return on our common stock over the
24-month period from June 1, 2003 to May 31, 2005.

The Series B Program is designed to provide participants
with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
if the total cumulative return on United Dominion’s common
stock, as measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid
plus share price appreciation during the measurement period
(a) exceeds the cumulative total return of the Morgan
Stanley REIT Index peer group index over the same period; and
(b) is at least the equivalent of a 22% total return, or
11% annualized.

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if United
Dominion’s total cumulative return satisfies these
criteria, the Series B LLC as holder of the Series B
OPPSs will receive (for the indirect benefit of the Participants
as holders of interests in the Series B LLC) distributions
and allocations of income and loss from the Operating
Partnership (accounted for on a consistent basis with all other
OP Units) equal to the distributions and allocations that would
be received on the number of OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of United Dominion’s common stock over the
    measurement period exceeds the greater of the cumulative total
    return of the Morgan Stanley REIT Index, which is the peer group
    index, or the minimum return (such excess being the “excess
    return”);

ii. multiplying 5% of the excess return by United
    Dominion’s market capitalization (defined as the average
    number of shares outstanding over the 24-month period, including
    common stock, OP Units, outstanding options, and convertible
    securities) multiplied by the daily closing price of United
    Dominion’s common stock, up to a maximum of 2% of market
    capitalization; and



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

iii. dividing the number obtained in (ii) by the
    market value of one share of United Dominion’s common stock
    on the valuation date, determined by the volume-weighted average
    price per day of common stock for the 20 trading days
    immediately preceding the valuation date.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of United
Dominion’s common stock does not meet the minimum return,
then the participants will forfeit their entire initial
investment.

Litigation and Legal Matters

United Dominion is subject to various legal proceedings and
claims arising in the ordinary course of business. United
Dominion cannot determine the ultimate liability with respect to
such legal proceedings and claims at this time. United Dominion
believes that such liability, to the extent not provided for
through insurance or otherwise, will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flow.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

United Dominion owns and operates multifamily apartment
communities throughout the United States that generate rental
and other property related income through the leasing of
apartment units to a diverse base of tenants. United Dominion
separately evaluates the performance of each of its apartment
communities. However, because each of the apartment communities
has similar economic characteristics, facilities, services, and
tenants, the apartment communities have been aggregated into a
single apartment communities segment. All segment disclosure is
included in or can be derived from United Dominion’s
consolidated financial statements.

There are no tenants that contributed 10% or more of United
Dominion’s total revenues during 2004, 2003, or 2002.
