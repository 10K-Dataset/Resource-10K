    CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

UDR, Inc. is a self administered real estate investment trust,
    or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages
    apartment communities nationwide. At December 31, 2007, our
    apartment portfolio included 234 communities located in 30
    markets, with a total of 65,867 completed apartment homes.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To continue to qualify as
    a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among
    other things, generally require that our assets consist
    primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily
    from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of
    our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to our
    stockholders annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will
    not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the
    corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute
    such net income to our stockholders annually. In 2007, we
    declared total distributions of $1.32 per common share to our
    stockholders, which represents our 31st year of consecutive
    dividend increases to our stockholders.

We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003,
    we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland.
    Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive,
    Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado. As of
    February 15, 2008, we had 1,787 full-time employees and 132
    part-time employees.

Our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships, Heritage
    Communities L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and United
    Dominion Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and
    RE


,
    our subsidiary that focuses on development, land entitlement and
    short-term hold investments. Unless the context otherwise
    requires, all references in this Report to “we,”
    “us,” “our,” “the company,” or
    “UDR” refer collectively to UDR, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries.

Business
    Objectives

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic
    returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders
    with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve
    this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following
    goals and strategies:

•

own and operate apartments in markets that have the best growth
    prospects based on favorable job formation and low single-family
    home affordability, thus enhancing stability and predictability
    of returns to our stockholders,

•

manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to
    buying, selling, and building apartment communities,

•

empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently
    and effectively,

•

measure and reward associates based on specific performance
    targets, and

•

manage our capital structure to ensure predictability of
    earnings and dividends.

    Accomplishments

•

We increased our common stock dividend for the
    31st consecutive year.

•

We completed over $1.7 billion of capital transactions in
    2007.

•

We acquired 2,671 apartment homes in 13 communities for
    approximately $404.1 million, six parcels of land for
    $70.7 million, and invested $11.8 million in an
    operating joint venture.



•

We completed the disposition of 12 apartment communities with
    3,435 apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of
    approximately $403.0 million, and one parcel of land for
    $4.5 million. In addition, we sold 61 condominiums within
    two communities for a total consideration of $10.4 million.

•

We established a $650 million joint venture with a large
    domestic institutional partner. The venture owns a portfolio of
    3,690 stabilized homes located in nine multi-family communities
    in Austin, Dallas and Houston, Texas, and another 302 homes
    currently under development in Dallas, Texas. UDR realized
    proceeds of $326.2 million for the properties and has a 20%
    interest in the venture.

UDR’s
    Strategies and Vision

In the first quarter of 2007, UDR announced its vision to be the
    innovative multifamily real estate investment of choice. We
    identified four strategies to guide decision-making and
    accelerated growth:

1. Strengthen our portfolio

2. Expand
    RE


3. Transform operations

4. Source low-cost capital

Strengthen
    our Portfolio

UDR is focused on increasing its presence in markets with strong
    job growth, low housing affordability, and a favorable
    demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. Portfolio decisions
    consider third-party research, taking into account job growth,
    multifamily permitting, and housing affordability. In January
    2008, UDR announced that it has entered into a contract to sell
    25,684 apartment homes in 86 communities for $1.7 billion.
    The transaction is expected to close on or about March 3,
    2008, at which time UDR will receive $1.5 billion in cash
    and a note in the principal amount of $200 million. The
    note matures on the same date as the buyer’s senior
    financing, may be prepaid 14 months from the date of the
    note, bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.5% per annum and is
    secured by a pledge and security agreement and a guarantee.
    Closing is subject to customary closing conditions. Upon
    completion of the transaction, UDR will own 40,183 homes in 148
    communities.

This portfolio sale dramatically accelerates UDR’s
    transformation to focus on markets that have the best growth
    prospects based on favorable job formation and low single-family
    home affordability. Upon completion of the sale, UDR expects
    that approximately 90% of its net operating income will be
    generated from homes located in markets on the Pacific Coast,
    the Virginia-Washington, D.C. corridor and Florida.

Acquisitions

During 2007, in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our
    portfolio, UDR acquired 13 communities with 2,671 apartment
    homes at a total cost of approximately $404.1 million,
    including the assumption of secured debt. In addition, we
    purchased six parcels of land for $70.7 million and
    invested $11.8 million in an operating joint venture. UDR
    is targeting apartment community acquisitions in markets where
    job growth expectations are above the national average, home
    affordability is low, and the demand/supply ratio for
    multi-family housing is favorable.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•

population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall
    potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
    environment of the community in which the property is located,

•

geographic location, including proximity to our existing
    communities which can deliver significant economies of scale,

•

construction quality, condition and design of the community,

•

current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability
    to increase cash flow,



•

potential for capital appreciation of the property,

•

ability to increase the value and profitability of the property
    through upgrades and repositioning,

•

terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent
    increases,

•

occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar
    type in the vicinity,

•

prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing
    of the property, and

•

competition from existing multifamily communities and the
    potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in
    the area.

Dispositions

We regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase the
    quality and performance of our portfolio. During 2007, we sold
    over 7,000 of our slower growing, non-core apartment homes while
    exiting some markets, specifically Colorado and Georgia, in an
    effort to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio.
    Proceeds from the disposition program were used primarily to
    reduce debt and fund acquisitions.

Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property
    include:

•

current market price for an asset compared to projected
    economics for that asset,

•

potential increases in new construction in the market area,

•

areas where the economy is not expected to grow
    substantially, and

•

markets where we do not intend to establish long-term
    concentration.

At December 31, 2007, we had 86 communities with a total of
    25,684 apartment homes, two communities with a total of 579
    condominiums, and one commercial unit classified as real estate
    held for disposition. In January 2008, UDR announced that it had
    entered into a contract in the fourth quarter of 2007 to sell
    25,684 apartment homes in 86 communities for $1.7 billion.

Expanding
    RE


RE


is our subsidiary that focuses on development, land entitlement
    and short-term hold investments. We expanded its development and
    redevelopment pipelines through a variety of activities. At
    December 31, 2007, UDR’s total development pipeline
    totaled over 16,600 homes with a budget over $2.7 billion.

Our wholly owned, under development pipeline stands at 6,386
    homes with a budgeted cost of $1.0 billion, of which 3,234
    homes in five communities are under construction and the
    remaining 3,152 homes will be built on 12 land sites. An
    additional 1,594 homes budgeted at $244 million are
    completed developments or developments in progress in a
    pre-sale, contract-to-purchase program. Our completed
    redevelopment and redevelopment pipeline stands at 2,956 homes
    with a budgeted cost of $150 million, our future
    development pipeline of owned properties provides for
    construction of an additional 4,419 homes budgeted at
    $848 million, and the remaining 1,304 homes with a budgeted
    cost of $395 million comprise our interest in one
    consolidated development joint venture and three unconsolidated
    joint ventures.

    2007.

Redevelopment
    Activities

During 2007, we continued to reposition properties in targeted
    markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value
    and achieve greater than inflationary increases in rents over
    the long term. In 2007, we spent $194.4 million or $2,829
    per home on capital expenditures for all of our communities,
    excluding development, condominium conversions and commercial
    properties. These capital improvements included turnover related
    expenditures for floor coverings and appliances, other recurring
    capital expenditures such as roofs, siding, parking lots, and
    asset preservation capital expenditures, which aggregated
    $44.4 million or $646 per home. In addition, revenue
    enhancing capital expenditures, kitchen and bath upgrades,
    upgrades to HVAC equipment, and other extensive
    exterior/interior upgrades totaled $78.2 million or $1,138
    per home, and major renovations totaled $71.8 million or
    $1,045 per home for the year ended December 31, 2007.

UDR owns a 20% interest in a joint venture to which UDR sold
    nine operating properties, consisting of 3,690 homes, and
    contributed Lincoln Town Square II, as noted above. In addition,
    UDR owns a 49% interest in an operating joint venture which owns
    and operates a recently completed 23-story, 166 apartment home
    high rise community in Bellevue, WA.

Transforming
    Operations

During 2007, UDR has been committed to growing net operating
    income through automation and improving the ease of doing
    business with us. Since adopting our new Corporate Strategies,
    UDR selected and began to deploy YieldStar revenue management
    software, launched a newly redesigned, customer-oriented web
    site with better features, and improved the quality of our
    photos on the web. The new

www.udr.com

web site
    features

side-by-side

apartment and floor plan comparisons, enhanced mapping,
    additional pricing options, 360 degree virtual tours, a
    furniture arrangement feature, mobile web site access, and
    click-to-chat and click-to-call for online support. In the first
    month following the launch, UDR experienced the highest unique
    visitor traffic in its history.

UDR also launched a new

Spanish-language

site, marketing to Latinos, the nation’s fastest-growing
    ethnic group. The site offers over 4,000 Spanish translated web
    pages and includes apartments for rent search resources. The
    website can be found at

http://es.udr.com

and can
    also be found on any web-enabled mobile device.

These enhancements have increased traffic and reduced
    administrative and marketing costs as we implemented internet
    initiatives and technology solutions to drive traffic from low
    cost or no cost sources. As a result, customer acquisition costs
    have been reduced significantly.

Sourcing
    Low-Cost Capital

During 2007, UDR established a $650 million joint venture
    with a large domestic institutional partner. The venture owns a
    portfolio of 3,690 stabilized homes located in nine multi-family
    communities in Austin, Dallas and Houston, Texas, and another
    302 homes currently under development in Dallas, Texas. In
    addition to this $350 million initial pool of assets, the
    joint venture contains a $300 million expansion feature for
    future acquisitions. At closing, the venture secured a
    $232 million, seven year, interest only mortgage which is
    recourse only to the properties and bears interest at a rate of
    5.61% per annum. The venture secured a commitment for a loan in
    the principal amount of $21.7 million to replace
    construction financing on an apartment community under
    development. The take-out loan provides for interest only, bears
    interest at 5.55% per annum and will have a term of
    6 years. UDR realized proceeds of $326.2 million for
    the properties and we hold a 20% interest in the venture. In
    addition to the upfront proceeds, UDR has the opportunity for
    future proceeds after certain IRR hurdles are achieved.

Financing
    Activities

As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we
    utilized proceeds from dispositions, debt and equity offerings
    and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt,
    and acquire apartment communities. The following is a summary of
    our major financing activities in 2007:

•

Repaid $186.8 million of secured debt and
    $167.3 million of unsecured debt.

•

Sold $150 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.50% senior unsecured notes due April 2014 in March 2007
    under our medium-term note program. The net proceeds of
    approximately $149 million were used for debt repayment.

•

Redeemed 5,416,009 shares of our 8.60% Series B
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on May 29, 2007, the
    redemption date, for a cash redemption price of $25 per share
    plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

•

Sold $135 million, or 5,400,000 shares, of our 6.75%
    Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in May 2007.
    The shares have a liquidation preference of $25 per share
    and will be redeemable at par



at the option of UDR on or after May 31, 2012. The net
    proceeds from the offering were used to fund the redemption of
    all of the outstanding shares of our 8.60% Series B
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.

•

Amended and restated our existing three-year $500 million
    unsecured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of
    May 31, 2008, to increase the facility to $600 million
    and to extend its maturity to July 26, 2012. Under certain
    circumstances, we may increase the facility to $750 million.

•

Repurchased 3,114,500 shares of our common stock at an
    average price per share of $25.02 under our 10 million
    share repurchase program during the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2007.

Markets
    and Competitive Conditions

Upon completion of the portfolio sale announced in January 2008,
    we expect that approximately 90% of our net operating income
    will be generated from homes located in markets on the Pacific
    Coast, the Virginia-Washington, D.C. corridor and Florida.
    We believe that this diversification increases investment
    opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical
    local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the
    stability and predictability of our earnings.

In many of our markets, competition for new residents is
    intense. Some competing communities offer features that our
    communities do not have. Competing communities can use
    concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive
    advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer
    than our communities. The competitive position of each community
    is different depending upon many factors including sub-market
    supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors
    compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop
    new properties. These competitors include insurance companies,
    pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment
    companies and other apartment REITs. This competition could
    increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely
    pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources, or lower
    capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete
    effectively for residents and investments. We believe our
    competitive advantages include:

•

a fully integrated organization with property management,
    development, acquisition, marketing and financing expertise,

•

scalable operating and support systems,

•

purchasing power,

•

geographic diversification with a presence in 30 markets across
    the country, and

•

significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us
    to be a local operating expert.

Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease
    management, improved expense control, increased resident
    retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive
    plans tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan
    of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in
    targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform,
    should position us for continued operational improvement.

Communities

At December 31, 2007, our apartment portfolio included 234
    communities having a total of 65,867 completed apartment homes.
    The overall quality of our portfolio has significantly improved
    with the disposition of non-core apartment homes and our upgrade
    and rehabilitation program. The upgrading of the portfolio
    provides several key benefits related to portfolio
    profitability. It enables us to raise rents more significantly
    and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income
    who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses, such as
    water and sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. In
    addition, it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures
    per apartment home, and therefore should result in increased
    cash flow.

Same
    Community Comparison

Same community property net operating income increased 7.0% or
    $17.7 million compared to 2006. The increase in property
    net operating income was primarily attributable to a 5.0% or
    $18.8 million increase in



revenues from rental and other income and a 0.9% or
    $1.1 million increase in operating expenses. The increase
    in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by
    a 4.2% or $16.2 million increase in rental rates, an 11.4%
    or $3.0 million increase in reimbursement income and fee
    income, and a 16.2% or $1.0 million decrease in rental
    concessions. These increases were partially offset by a 6.8% or
    $1.3 million increase in vacancy loss. Physical occupancy
    decreased 0.2% to 94.6%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 5.2% or $1.8 million increase in real estate taxes
    that was partially offset by a 7.6% or $0.8 million
    decrease in administrative and marketing costs.

Customers

Our upgrade and rehabilitation programs enable us to raise rents
    and attract residents with higher levels of disposable income
    who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses, such as
    water and sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. We
    believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in
    terms of rent growth, stability of occupancy and investment
    opportunities.

Tax
    Matters

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To
    continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain
    tests that, among other things, generally require that our
    assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be
    derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we
    distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than
    net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we
    maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be
    subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level
    on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed
    to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as
    a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state
    and local taxes on our income and property.

We may utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries to engage in activities
    that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the
    provision of management and other services to third parties and
    the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions.
    Taxable REIT subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular
    corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and
    local income taxes.

Inflation

Substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or
    less, which may enable us to realize increased rents upon
    renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Such
    short-term leases generally minimize the risk to us of the
    adverse effects of inflation, although as a general rule these
    leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term
    without penalty. Short-term leases and relatively consistent
    demand allow rents to provide an attractive hedge against
    inflation.

Environmental
    Matters

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing
    operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include
    those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials
    in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and
    notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active
    underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management
    activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could
    subject us to a government enforcement action

and/or

claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental
    protection regulations has not had a material effect on our
    capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have
    a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of
    the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports
    have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition,
    all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition.
    The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental
    consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the
    purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is
    possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all
    environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental
    liabilities exist of



which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise
    economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of
    removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive
    or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks
    involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any
    large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that
    through professional environmental inspections and testing for
    asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with
    a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known
    environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential
    liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential
    housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential
    residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
    hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such
    notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the
    communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in
    that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint
    are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any
    such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by
    children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our
    properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a
    material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.
    We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we
    are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance,
    liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in
    connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that
    the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental
    laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us
    or our financial condition or results of operations. Future
    environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may
    require additional remediation of existing conditions that are
    not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements
    are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could
    have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our
    communities, with limits of liability customary within the
    industry to insure against liability claims and related defense
    costs. We are also insured, in all material respects, against
    the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to
    reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to
    repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income
    during the reconstruction period.

NYSE
    Certification

On May 31, 2007, our Chief Executive Officer submitted to

    Section 303A.12(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual
    regarding our compliance with NYSE corporate governance listing

    Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as
    Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to this Report.

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

There are many factors that affect our business and our results
    of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The
    following is a description of important factors that may cause
    our actual results of operations in future periods to differ
    materially from those currently expected or discussed in
    forward-looking statements set forth in this Report relating to
    our financial results, operations and business prospects. Except
    as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any
    such forward-looking statements to reflect events or
    circumstances after the date on which it is made.

Unfavorable Changes in Apartment Market and Economic
    Conditions Could Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels and Rental
    Rates.

Market and economic conditions in the
    metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect
    our occupancy levels and rental rates and, therefore, our
    profitability. Factors that may adversely affect these
    conditions include the following:

•

a reduction in jobs and other local economic downturns,

•

declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing
    more affordable,

•

government or builder incentives which enable first time
    homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative
    housing decisions easier to make,

•

oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes,

•

declines in household formation, and

•

rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating
    rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to
    offset increases in operating costs.



The strength of the United States economy has become
    increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of
    terrorism. At the same time, productivity enhancements and the
    increased exportation of labor have resulted in limited job
    growth despite an improving economy. Continued weakness in job
    creation, or any worsening of current economic conditions,
    generally and in our principal market areas, could have a
    material adverse effect on our occupancy levels, our rental
    rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of
    apartment communities. This may impair our ability to satisfy
    our financial obligations and pay distributions to our
    stockholders.

New Acquisitions, Developments and Condominium Projects May
    Not Achieve Anticipated Results.

We intend to
    continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet
    our investment criteria and to develop apartment communities for
    rental operations, to convert properties into condominiums and
    to develop condominium projects. Our acquisition, development
    and condominium activities and their success are subject to the
    following risks:

•

an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we
    expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure
    related to the acquired property may go undetected during our
    due diligence procedures,

•

when we acquire an apartment community, we often invest
    additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing
    profitability. These additional investments may not produce the
    anticipated improvements in profitability,

•

new developments may not achieve pro forma rents or occupancy
    levels, or problems with construction or local building codes
    may delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a
    development community, and

•

an over supply of condominiums in a given market may cause a
    decrease in the prices at which we expect to sell condominium
    properties or cause us to be unable to sell condominium
    properties.

Possible Difficulty of Selling Apartment Communities Could
    Limit Operational and Financial Flexibility.

We
    periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer
    meet our strategic objectives, but market conditions could
    change and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices
    acceptable to us. A weak market may limit our ability to change
    our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic
    conditions. Furthermore, a significant portion of the proceeds
    from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in
    order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under
    Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, so that any
    related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax
    purposes. As a result, we may not have immediate access to all
    of the cash flow generated from our property sales. In addition,
    federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of
    communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and
    this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when
    market conditions are favorable.

Increased Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease
    Apartment Homes or Increase or Maintain
    Rents.

Our apartment communities compete with
    numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including
    other apartment communities and single-family rental homes, as
    well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes.
    Competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect
    our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain
    rents.

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and
    Create Refinancing Risk.

We are subject to the
    risks normally associated with debt financing, including the
    risk that our operating income and cash flow will be
    insufficient to make required payments of principal and
    interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our
    line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash
    flow may not be available to make all required principal
    payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to
    maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available
    to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints
    of our debt covenants. Additionally, we are likely to need to
    refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it
    matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the
    terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of
    the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets
    or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose
    to do so. In



addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could
    result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its
    maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow
    and increase our financing costs.

Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt
    Service Payments and Distributions to
    Stockholders.

If our apartment communities do not
    generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses,
    our ability to make required payments of interest and principal
    on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our
    stockholders will be adversely affected. The following factors,
    among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our
    apartment communities:

•

the national and local economies,

•

local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of
    apartment homes,

•

tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience, and
    attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where
    they are located,

•

our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and
    insurance, and

•

rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities.

Expenses associated with our investment in a community, such as
    debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance
    costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a
    reduction in rental income from that community. If a community
    is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make
    the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of
    foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies
    by the mortgage holder.

Debt Level May Be Increased.

Our current
    debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of
    debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is
    limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We
    manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants,
    but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase
    the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent
    improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.

Financing May Not Be Available and Could Be
    Dilutive.

Our ability to execute our business
    strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt
    financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms
    of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including
    common and preferred equity. We and other companies in the real
    estate industry have experienced limited availability of
    financing from time to time. Debt or equity financing may not be
    available in sufficient amounts, or on favorable terms or at
    all. If we issue additional equity securities to finance
    developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the
    interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted.

Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our
    Profitability.

We intend to continue to develop
    and construct apartment communities. Development activities may
    be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or
    through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. Our
    development and construction activities may be exposed to the
    following risks:

•

we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining,
    necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other
    required governmental permits and authorizations, which could
    result in increased development costs and could require us to
    abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for
    which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations,

•

if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the
    development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable
    financing for the developments, our development capacity may be
    limited,

•

we may abandon development opportunities that we have already
    begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already
    incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities,

•

we may be unable to complete construction and

lease-up

of
    a community on schedule, or incur development or construction
    costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable
    to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such
    costs,



•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may
    fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and
    economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our
    profitability goals for that community, and

•

when we sell to third parties homes or properties that we
    developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or
    construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the
    limits of our insurance.

Construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets,
    and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have, in some
    cases, exceeded our original estimates. We may experience
    similar cost increases in the future. Our inability to charge
    rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any
    increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Some Potential Losses Are Not Covered by
    Insurance.

We have a comprehensive insurance
    program covering our property and operating activities. We
    believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these
    policies are adequate and appropriate. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses for which we may not have
    insurance. Accordingly, we may sustain uninsured losses due to
    insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims
    or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage.

We may not be able to renew insurance coverage in an adequate
    amount or at reasonable prices. In addition, insurance companies
    may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses,
    such as losses due to terrorist acts and mold, or, if offered,
    these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive. If an
    uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we
    could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a
    property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the
    property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain
    obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations
    related to the property. Material losses in excess of insurance
    proceeds may occur in the future. If one or more of our
    significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss,
    it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and
    result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Such
    events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make
    distributions to stockholders.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our
    Growth.

We may from time to time make
    acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate
    opportunities arise. We may be exposed to a variety of risks if
    we choose to enter new markets, and we may not be able to
    operate successfully in new markets. These risks include, among
    others:

•

inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market
    conditions and local economies,

•

inability to obtain land for development or to identify
    appropriate acquisition opportunities,

•

inability to hire and retain key personnel, and

•

lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting
    procedures.

Changing Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and
    Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow and the Market Price of Our
    Securities.

We currently have, and expect to
    incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary
    with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2007, we had
    approximately $522.1 million of variable rate indebtedness
    outstanding, which constitutes approximately 15% of our total
    outstanding indebtedness as of such date. An increase in
    interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase
    the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing
    new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely
    affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make
    distributions to security holders. In addition, an increase in
    market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a
    higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market
    price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities.

Risk of Inflation/Deflation.

Substantial
    inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative
    effect on rental rates and property operating expenses.

Limited Investment Opportunities Could Adversely Affect Our
    Growth.

We expect that other real estate
    investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties
    and to develop new properties. These competitors include
    insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer
    partnerships, investment companies and other apartment REITs.
    This competition could increase prices for properties of the
    type that we would likely



pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources than we
    do. As a result, we may not be able to make attractive
    investments on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our
    growth.

Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel
    Could Create Inefficiencies.

To grow
    successfully, we must be able to apply our experience in
    managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a
    larger number of properties. In addition, we must be able to
    integrate new management and operations personnel as our
    organization grows in size and complexity. Failures in either
    area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect
    our expected return on our investments and our overall
    profitability.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May
    Result in Material Charges.

From time to time
    when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit
    our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period
    prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest
    rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the
    predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time
    we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our
    exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in
    market interest rates. If the terms of new debt securities are
    not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall
    below that which we incur under a particular interest rate
    hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore, the
    settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and
    may in the future involve material charges.

Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could
    Result in Substantial Costs.

Under various
    federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or
    former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to
    investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of
    currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic
    substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or
    responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our
    current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. In
    addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or
    to third parties for property damage and for investigation and

clean-up

costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs
    could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws
    create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure
    their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to
    properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially
    and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent
    an affected property.

We Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if We Fail to Qualify
    as a REIT.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT
    under the Internal Revenue Code. Our qualification as a REIT
    requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual
    and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and
    complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are
    only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and
    involves the determination of various factual matters and
    circumstances not entirely within our control. We intend that
    our current organization and method of operation enable us to
    continue to qualify as a REIT, but we may not so qualify or we
    may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. In
    addition, U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs and
    other corporations and the administrative interpretations of
    those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with
    retroactive effect. Future legislation, new regulations,
    administrative interpretations or court decisions could
    adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or adversely
    affect our stockholders.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be
    subject to federal income tax (including any applicable
    alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular
    corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends
    paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. Also,
    unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under
    certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from
    treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
    year in which we first failed to qualify. The additional tax
    liability from the failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce or
    eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or
    distribution to our stockholders. This would likely have a
    significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and
    our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we would
    no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.
    Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be
    subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income
    and property.

We May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable REIT
    Subsidiaries, Which are Subject to Certain Tax
    Risks.

We have established several taxable REIT
    subsidiaries. Despite our qualification as a REIT, our taxable
    REIT subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income.
    In addition, we must



comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a REIT for
    federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments
    in our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally do not constitute
    permissible income and investments for these tests. While we
    will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries will not adversely affect our REIT qualification,
    we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve
    that result. Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty
    tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on
    real property sales, or our taxable REIT subsidiaries may be
    denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable
    REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in
    nature or are otherwise not respected.

Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited
    Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain
    Attributable to the Transaction.

From time to
    time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our
    properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting
    from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or
    primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of
    business would be treated as income from a prohibited
    transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire
    properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our
    occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited
    transactions. However, whether property is held for investment
    purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and
    circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The
    Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or
    disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. If
    the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a
    transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited
    transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax
    on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and
    we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real
    property sales. In addition, income from a prohibited
    transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the
    income tests for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax
    purposes.

Changes in Market Conditions and Volatility of Stock Prices
    Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common
    Stock.

The stock markets, including the New York
    Stock Exchange, on which we list our common shares, have
    experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a
    result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly
    volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a
    decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases
    unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.

Property Ownership Through Joint Ventures May Limit Our
    Ability to Act Exclusively in Our Interest.

We
    have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire
    properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when
    we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. If
    we use such a structure, we could become engaged in a dispute
    with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect
    our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. Moreover, joint
    venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives
    that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives
    that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or
    refinancing of a property. In some instances, joint venture
    partners may have competing interests in our markets that could
    create conflicts of interest.

Compliance or Failure to Comply with the Americans with
    Disabilities Act of 1990 or Other Safety Regulations and
    Requirements Could Result in Substantial Costs.

The
    Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public
    buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to
    disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition
    of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to
    private litigants. From time to time claims may be asserted
    against us with respect to some of our properties under this
    Act. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are
    required to make substantial alterations and capital
    expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the
    removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our
    financial condition and results of operations.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local
    regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life
    safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these
    requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We
    do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether
    compliance with future requirements will require significant
    unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and
    results of operations.



Real Estate Tax and Other Laws.

Generally we
    do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance
    with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property
    tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in
    income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. These
    costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability
    to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance
    with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential
    liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or
    the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or
    (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws
    regulating housing, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act
    and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, may result in
    significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely
    affect funds from operations and the ability to make
    distributions to stockholders.

Risk of Damage from Catastrophic Weather
    Events.

Certain of our communities are located in
    the general vicinity of active earthquake faults, mudslides and
    fires, and others where there are hurricanes, tornadoes or risks
    of other inclement weather. The adverse weather events could
    cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. In the event
    of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital
    invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated
    future revenue from that community. We would also continue to be
    obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other
    obligations related to the community. Any such loss could
    materially and adversely affect our business and our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Insurance coverage for such catastrophic events is expensive due
    to limited industry capacity. As a result, we may experience
    shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are
    such that insurance is not available.

Terrorist Attacks May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business
    and Operating Results and Could Decrease the Value of Our
    Assets.

Terrorist attacks and other acts of
    violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our
    business and operating results. Attacks that directly impact one
    or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect
    our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our
    ability to achieve our expected results. Further, our insurance
    coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack.
    In addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and
    threats of future attacks could have on the U.S. economy
    could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business
    and results of operations.

Any Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Stock
    Price.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal
    report over financial reporting. If we identify one or more
    material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
    reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and
    completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have
    an adverse effect on our stock price.

Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to
    Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in Our
    Stockholders’ Best Interests.

Maryland
    business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to
    acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject
    to various Maryland laws which may have the effect of
    discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the
    difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our
    acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests.
    The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other
    business combination transactions between us and any person who
    acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock
    representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board
    of directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination
    transaction could not be completed until five years after the
    person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the
    approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled
    to be cast and


/


%
    of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested
    stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also
    provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our
    equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of
    the voting power in electing directors will have no voting
    rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares
    eligible to vote.

Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability
    of Our Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company
    May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to Our Stockholders.

One of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification
    as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes is that no
    more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be
    owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified
    in the Internal Revenue Code, during the last half of any
    taxable year. Our charter contains ownership and transfer
    restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in
    complying with this and other



REIT ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have
    the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not
    threaten REIT status. These restrictions include a provision
    that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9%
    of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board
    of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation,
    provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to
    exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. These
    provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
    preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a
    change of control might involve a premium price for our
    stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’
    best interests.

Item 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising
    in the ordinary course of business. We cannot determine the
    ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and
    claims at this time. We believe that such liability, to the
    extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, will not
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flow.

Item 4.

SUBMISSION
    OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of our security holders
    during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31,

MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Common
    Stock

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under
    the symbol “UDR.” The following tables set forth the
    quarterly high and low sale prices per common share reported on
    the NYSE for each quarter of the last two fiscal years.
    Distribution information for common stock reflects distributions
    declared per share for each calendar quarter and paid at the end
    of the following month.

On February 15, 2008, the closing sale price of our common
    stock was $22.51 per share on the NYSE and there were 5,521
    holders of record of the 133,347,522 outstanding shares of our
    common stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax purposes,
    approximately 16% of the distributions for each of the four
    quarters of 2007 represented ordinary income, 64% represented
    long-term capital gain, and 20% represented unrecaptured
    section 1250 gain.

We pay regular quarterly distributions to holders of shares of
    our common stock. Future distributions will be at the discretion
    of our board of directors and will depend on our actual funds
    from operations, financial condition and capital requirements,
    the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions
    of the Internal Revenue Code, and other factors. The annual
    distribution payment for calendar year 2007 necessary for us to
    maintain our status as a REIT was approximately $0.18 per share
    of common stock. We declared total distributions of $1.32 per
    share of common stock for 2007.

Series E
    Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock has no
    stated par value and a liquidation preference of $16.61 per
    share. Subject to certain adjustments and conditions, each share
    of the Series E is convertible at any time and from time to
    time at the holder’s option into one share of our common
    stock. The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on
    an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the
    holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for
    the election of directors or for any other purpose on which the
    holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E
    has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or
    any mandatory redemption.

Distributions declared on the Series E in 2007 were $1.33
    per share or $0.3322 per quarter. The Series E is not
    listed on any exchange. At December 31, 2007, a total of
    2,803,812 shares of the Series E were outstanding.



Series F
    Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of our
    Series F Preferred Stock. Our Series F Preferred Stock
    may be purchased by holders of our operating partnership units,
    or OP Units, described below under “Operating
    Partnership Units,” at a purchase price of $0.0001 per
    share. OP Unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and
    purchase one share of our Series F Preferred Stock for each
    OP Unit held. At December 31, 2007, a total of
    666,293 shares of the Series F Preferred Stock were
    outstanding at a value of $66.63. Holders of the Series F
    Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for each share of the
    Series F Preferred Stock they hold, voting together with
    the holders of our common stock, on each matter submitted to a
    vote of securityholders at a meeting of our stockholders. The
    Series F Preferred Stock does not entitle its holders to
    any other rights, privileges or preferences.

Dividend
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under
    which holders of our common stock may elect to automatically
    reinvest their distributions and make additional cash payments
    to acquire additional shares of our common stock. Stockholders
    who do not participate in the plan continue to receive dividends
    as declared. As of February 15, 2008, there were 3,183
    participants in the plan.

Operating
    Partnership Units

From time to time we issue shares of our common stock in
    exchange for OP Units tendered to our operating
    partnerships, United Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage
    Communities L.P., for redemption in accordance with the
    provisions of their respective partnership agreements. At
    December 31, 2007, there were 8,653,560 OP Units and
    316,452 OP Units in United Dominion Realty, L.P. and
    Heritage Communities L.P., respectively, that were owned by
    limited partners. The holder of the OP Units has the right
    to require United Dominion Realty, L.P. to redeem all or a
    portion of the OP Units held by the holder in exchange for
    a cash payment based on the market value of our common stock at
    the time of redemption. However, United Dominion Realty,
    L.P.’s obligation to pay the cash amount is subject to the
    prior right of the company to acquire such OP Units in
    exchange for either the cash amount or shares of our common
    stock. Heritage Communities L.P. OP Units are convertible
    into common stock in lieu of cash, at our option, once the
    holder elects to convert, at an exchange ratio of
    1.575 shares for each OP Unit. In December 2007, the
    Series A limited liability company was dissolved, the
    Series A OPPS were distributed to the members of the
    Series A limited liability company and, as a result, the
    members of Series A limited liability company became
    limited partners in United Dominion Realty, L.P. These
    OP Units are convertible into common stock, once the
    holders elected to convert, at an exchange ratio of
    1.5091 shares for each OP Unit. During 2007, we issued
    a total of 1,031,627 shares of common stock in exchange for
    OP Units.

Purchases
    of Equity Securities

In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a
    10 million share repurchase program. This program
    authorizes the repurchase of our common stock in open market
    purchases, in block purchases, privately negotiated
    transactions, or otherwise. As reflected in the table below,
    1,232,300 shares of common stock were repurchased under
    this program or otherwise during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2007.



The following table sets forth certain information regarding our
    common stock repurchases during the quarter ended

    program. Under the two share repurchase programs, UDR may
    repurchase shares of our common stock in open market purchase,
    block purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.

    among UDR, the NAREIT Equity REIT Index, Standard &
    Poor’s 500 Stock Index, the NAREIT Equity Apartment Index
    and the MSCI US REIT Index. The graph assumes that $100 was
    invested on December 31, 2002, in each of our common stock
    and the indices presented. Historical stock price performance is

Forward-Looking
    Statements

This Report contains forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such
    forward-looking statements include, without limitation,
    statements concerning property acquisitions and dispositions,
    development activity and capital expenditures, capital raising
    activities, rent growth, occupancy, and rental expense growth.
    Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”
    “seeks,” “estimates,” and variations of such
    words and similar expressions are intended to identify such
    forward-looking statements. Such statements involve known and
    unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause
    our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
    different from the results of operations or plans expressed or
    implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors
    include, among other things, unanticipated adverse business
    developments affecting us, or our properties, adverse changes in
    the real estate markets and general and local economies and
    business conditions. Although we believe that the assumptions
    underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are
    reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and
    therefore such statements included in this Report may not prove
    to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties
    inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the
    inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a
    representation by us or any other person that the results or
    conditions described in such statements or our objectives and
    plans will be achieved.

Business
    Overview

We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns,
    acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities
    nationwide. We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In
    June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia
    to Maryland. Our subsidiaries include two operating
    partnerships, Heritage Communities L.P., a Delaware limited
    partnership, and United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware
    limited partnership. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
    references in this Report to “we,” “us,”
    “our,” “the company,” or “UDR”
    refer collectively to UDR, Inc. and its subsidiaries.



At December 31, 2007, our portfolio included 234
    communities with 65,867 apartment homes nationwide. The
    following table summarizes our market information by major
    geographic markets (includes real estate held for disposition,
    real estate under development, and land, but excludes commercial
    properties):

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial
    obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale or
    maturity of existing assets, or by the acquisition of additional
    funds through capital



management. Both the coordination of asset and liability
    maturities and effective capital management are important to the
    maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is our
    cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates,
    occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our
    portfolio of apartment homes. We routinely use our unsecured
    bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and
    financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term
    financing. During the past several years, proceeds from the sale
    of real estate have been used for both investing and financing
    activities.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements
    generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings
    under credit arrangements. We expect to meet certain long-term
    liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the
    repayment of financing on development activities, and potential
    property acquisitions, through long-term secured and unsecured
    borrowings, the disposition of properties, and the issuance of
    additional debt or equity securities. We believe that our net
    cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet
    both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the
    company in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short-
    and long-term. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for
    improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected
    to be funded from property operations.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission which provides for the issuance of an
    indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt
    securities, warrants, purchase contracts and units to facilitate
    future financing activities in the public capital markets.
    Access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at
    the time of issuance.

Future
    Capital Needs

Future development expenditures are expected to be funded with
    proceeds from the sale of property, with construction loans,
    through joint ventures, the use of our unsecured revolving
    credit facility, and to a lesser extent, with cash flows
    provided by operating activities. Acquisition activity in
    strategic markets is expected to be largely financed through the
    issuance of equity and debt securities, the issuance of
    operating partnership units, the assumption or placement of
    secured

and/or

unsecured debt and by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale
    of properties.

During 2008, we have approximately $11.7 million of secured
    debt and $275.9 million of unsecured debt maturing and we
    anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings
    under our secured or unsecured credit facilities, the issuance
    of new unsecured debt securities or equity or from disposition
    proceeds.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our critical accounting policies are those having the most
    impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results
    and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. These
    policies include those related to (1) capital expenditures,
    (2) impairment of long-lived assets, and (3) real
    estate investment properties. With respect to these critical
    accounting policies, we believe that the application of
    judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces
    financial information that fairly depicts the results of
    operations for all periods presented.

Capital
    Expenditures

In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States, we capitalize those expenditures related to
    acquiring new assets, materially enhancing the value of an
    existing asset, or substantially extending the useful life of an
    existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing
    property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as
    incurred.

During 2007, $194.4 million or $2,829 per home was spent on
    capital expenditures for all of our communities, excluding
    development, condominium conversions and commercial properties.
    These capital improvements included turnover related
    expenditures for floor coverings and appliances, other recurring
    capital expenditures such as roofs, siding, parking lots, and
    asset preservation capital expenditures, which aggregated
    $44.4 million or $646 per home. In addition, revenue
    enhancing capital expenditures, kitchen and bath upgrades,
    upgrades to HVAC equipment, and other extensive
    exterior/interior upgrades totaled $78.2 million or



$1,138 per home, and major renovations totaled
    $71.8 million or $1,045 per home for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

The following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and
    maintenance costs for all of our communities, excluding real
    estate under development, condominium conversions and commercial
    properties, for the periods presented:

Total capital expenditures for our communities decreased
    $21.3 million or $167 per home for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This
    decrease was attributable to a $65.9 million decrease in
    revenue enhancing improvements at certain of our properties that
    was offset by an additional $9.8 million being invested in
    recurring capital expenditures and an additional
    $34.8 million being invested in major renovations as
    compared to the same period in 2006. We will continue to
    selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe
    will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of
    our cost of capital. Recurring capital expenditures during 2008
    are currently expected to be approximately $650 per home.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
    operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
    assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
    estimated to be generated by the future operation and
    disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of
    those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical
    results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market
    and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The
    net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market
    value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best
    estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market
    rates and transactions.

Real
    Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time
    and allocate the purchase price to various components, such as
    land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases in
    accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, “Business
    Combinations.” The purchase price is allocated based on the
    relative fair value of each component. The fair value of
    buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon
    acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As
    such, the determination of fair value considers the present
    value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the
    property including an initial

lease-up

period. We determine the fair value of in-place leases by
    assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease
    relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In
    addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the
    foregone rents associated with the

lease-up

period, and the carrying costs associated with the

lease-up

period. The fair value of in-place leases is recorded and
    amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual
    lease period.



Statements
    of Cash Flow

The following discussion explains the changes in net cash
    provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing
    and financing activities that are presented in our Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows.

Operating
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2007, our net cash flow
    provided by operating activities was $250.6 million
    compared to $229.6 million for 2006. During 2007, the
    increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted
    primarily from the increase in property operating income from
    our apartment community portfolio (see discussion under
    “Apartment Community Operations”).

Investing
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash used in
    investing activities was $71.4 million compared to
    $150.0 million for 2006. Changes in the level of investing
    activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it
    relates to our acquisition, capital expenditure, development,
    and disposition programs, as well as the impact of the capital
    market environment on these activities, all of which are
    discussed in further detail below.

Acquisitions

For the year ended December 31, 2007, we acquired 13
    apartment communities with 2,671 apartment homes, six parcels of
    land, and one operating joint venture for an aggregate
    consideration of $486.5 million. In 2006, we acquired eight
    apartment communities with 2,763 apartment homes for an
    aggregate consideration of $327.5 million and two parcels
    of land for $19.9 million. Our long-term strategic plan is
    to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer,
    more concentrated markets. As a result, we have been expanding
    our interests in the fast growing Southern California, Florida,
    and Metropolitan Washington DC markets over the past years.
    During 2008, we plan to continue to channel new investments into
    those markets we believe will provide the best investment
    returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria
    including favorable job formation and low single-family home
    affordability.

Real
    Estate Under Development

Development activity is focused in core markets in which we have
    strong operations in place. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, we invested approximately $101.3 million in
    development projects, a decrease of $0.5 million from our
    2006 level of $101.8 million.

In addition, we owned 12 parcels of land held for future
    development aggregating $124.5 million at December 31,
    2007.



Consolidated
    Development Joint Venture

In June 2006, we completed the formation of a development joint
    venture that will invest approximately $138 million to
    develop one apartment community with 298 apartment homes in
    Marina del Rey, California. UDR is the financial partner and is
    responsible for funding the costs of development and receives a
    preferred return from 7% to 8.5% before our partner receives a
    50% participation. Our initial investment was
    $27.5 million. Under FASB Interpretation No. 46,
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” this
    venture has been consolidated into UDR’s financial
    statements. Our joint venture partner is the managing partner as
    well as the developer, general contractor, and property manager.

Unconsolidated
    Joint Ventures

UDR is a partner in a joint venture to develop a site in
    Bellevue, Washington. At closing, we owned 49% of the project
    that involves building a 430 home high rise apartment building
    with ground floor retail. Our investment at December 31,
    2007 was $8.1 million.

UDR is a partner in a joint venture which will develop 274
    apartment homes in the central business district of Bellevue,
    Washington. Construction began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and
    is scheduled for completion in 2008. At closing, we owned 49% of
    the project. Our investment at December 31, 2007 and 2006
    was $8.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively.

In January 2007, we entered into a joint venture which owns and
    operates a recently completed 23-story, 166 apartment home high
    rise community in the central business district of Bellevue,
    Washington. At closing, UDR owned 49% of the project (subject to
    a $34 million mortgage). Our initial investment was
    $11.8 million. Our investment at December 31, 2007 was
    $11.2 million.

In November 2007, UDR and an institutional unaffiliated partner
    formed a joint venture which owns and operates various
    properties located in Texas. On the closing date, UDR sold nine
    operating properties, consisting of 3,690 units, and
    contributed one property under development to the joint venture.
    The property under development will have 302 units and is
    expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2008. UDR
    contributed cash and property equal to 20% of the fair value of
    the properties. The unaffiliated partner contributed cash equal
    to 80% of the fair value of the properties comprising the
    venture, which was then used to purchase the nine operating
    properties from UDR. Our investment at December 31, 2007
    was $20.1 million.

Disposition
    of Investments

For the year ended December 31, 2007, UDR sold 21
    communities with a total of 7,125 apartment homes for a gross
    consideration of $729.2 million, one parcel of land for
    $4.5 million, and contributed one property under
    development, at cost, to a joint venture arrangement in Texas.
    In addition, we sold 61 condominiums from two communities with a
    total of 640 condominiums for a gross consideration of
    $10.4 million. We recognized after-tax gains for financial
    reporting purposes of $256.2 million on these sales.
    Proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, UDR sold 24
    communities with 7,653 apartment homes for a gross consideration
    of $444.9 million. In addition, we sold 384 condominiums
    from four communities with a total of 612 condominiums for a
    gross consideration of $72.1 million. We recognized
    after-tax gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $148.6 million on these sales. Proceeds from the sales were
    used primarily to reduce debt.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities during 2007 was
    $178.1 million compared to $93.0 million in 2006. As
    part of the plan to improve our balance sheet, we utilized
    proceeds from dispositions, equity and debt offerings, and
    refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, and
    purchase new properties.

The following is a summary of our financing activities for the
    year ended December 31, 2007:

•

Repaid $186.8 million of secured debt and
    $167.3 million of unsecured debt.

•

Sold $150 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.50% senior unsecured notes due April 2014 in March 2007
    under our medium-term note program. The net proceeds of
    approximately $149 million were used for debt repayment.

•

Redeemed 5,416,009 shares of our 8.60% Series B
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on May 29, 2007, the
    redemption date, for a cash redemption price of $25 per share
    plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

•

Sold $135 million, or 5,400,000 shares, of our 6.75%
    Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in May 2007.
    The shares have a liquidation preference of $25 per share
    and will be redeemable at par at the option of UDR on or after
    May 31, 2012. The net proceeds from the offering were used
    to fund the redemption of all of the outstanding shares of our
    8.60% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.

•

Amended and restated our existing three-year $500 million
    unsecured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of
    May 31, 2008, to increase the facility to $600 million
    and to extend its maturity to July 26, 2012. Under certain
    circumstances, we may increase the facility to $750 million.

•

Repurchased 3,114,500 shares of UDR common stock at an
    average price per share of $25.02 under our 10 million
    share repurchase program during the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2007.

Credit
    Facilities

We have four secured revolving credit facilities with Fannie Mae
    with an aggregate commitment of $748.9 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, $663.9 million was outstanding
    under the Fannie Mae credit facilities leaving
    $85.0 million of unused capacity. The Fannie Mae credit
    facilities are for an initial term of ten years, bear interest
    at floating and fixed rates, and certain variable rate
    facilities can be extended for an additional five years at our
    option. We have $583.1 million of the funded balance fixed
    at a weighted average interest rate of 5.9% and the remaining
    balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average
    variable rate of 5.1%.

On July 27, 2007, we amended and restated our existing
    three-year $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit
    facility with a maturity date of May 31, 2008, (which could
    be extended for an additional year at our option) to increase
    the facility to $600 million and to extend its maturity to
    July 26, 2012. Under certain circumstances, we may increase
    the new $600 million credit facility to $750 million.
    Based on our current credit ratings, the $600 million
    credit facility carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a
    spread of 47.5 basis points, which represents a
    10 basis point reduction to the previous $500 million
    credit facility.



Under a competitive bid feature and for so long as we maintain
    an Investment Grade Rating, we have the right under the new
    $600 million credit facility to bid out 50% of the
    commitment amount and we can bid out 100% of the commitment
    amount once per quarter. As of December 31, 2007,
    $309.5 million was outstanding under the credit facility
    leaving $290.5 million of unused capacity.

The Fannie Mae credit facility and the bank revolving credit
    facility are subject to customary financial covenants and
    limitations.

Interest
    Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable
    rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced.
    We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other
    speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial
    instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets.
    Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in
    market interest rates and the fair value of market rate
    sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as
    changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable
    rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. A large portion of our
    market risk is exposure to short-term interest rates from
    variable rate borrowings outstanding under our Fannie Mae credit
    facility and our bank revolving credit facility, which totaled
    $80.8 million and $309.5 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2007. The impact on our financial statements
    of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2007 was
    immaterial.

If market interest rates for variable rate debt average
    100 basis points more in 2008 than they did during 2007,
    our interest expense would increase, and income before taxes
    would decrease by $5.2 million. Comparatively, if market
    interest rates for variable rate debt had averaged
    100 basis points more in 2007 than in 2006, our interest
    expense would have increased, and net income would have
    decreased by $4.9 million. If market rates for fixed rate
    debt were 100 basis points higher at December 31,
    2007, the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased
    from $2.9 billion to $2.8 billion. If market interest
    rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points lower at
    December 31, 2007, the fair value of fixed rate debt would
    have increased from $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of
    hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These
    analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of
    overall economic activity that could exist in such an
    environment. Further, in the event of a change of such
    magnitude, management would likely take actions to further
    mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the
    uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and
    their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no
    change in our financial structure.

Funds
    from Operations

Funds from operations, or FFO, is defined as net income
    (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of
    depreciable property, plus real estate depreciation and
    amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
    partnerships and joint ventures. We compute FFO for all periods
    presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by
    the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s
    (“NAREIT”) April 1, 2002 White Paper. We consider
    FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating
    performance, and believe that FFO should be considered along
    with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as
    a measure of our activities in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles. FFO does not represent cash
    generated from operating activities in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative
    of cash available to fund cash needs.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles implicitly assumes
    that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over
    time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen
    or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and
    analysts have considered the presentation of operating results
    for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to
    be insufficient by themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a
    supplemental measure of REIT operating performance and defines
    FFO as net income (computed in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding
    gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property,



premiums or original issuance costs associated with preferred
    stock redemptions, plus depreciation and amortization, and after
    adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
    The use of FFO, combined with the required presentations, has
    been fundamentally beneficial, improving the understanding of
    operating results of REITs among the investing public and making
    comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. We
    generally consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our
    comparative operating and financial performance (although FFO
    should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains
    the primary measure of performance) because by excluding gains
    or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating
    real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation
    and amortization, FFO can help one compare the operating
    performance of a company’s real estate between periods or
    as compared to different companies. We believe that FFO is the
    best measure of economic profitability for real estate
    investment trusts.

The following table outlines our FFO calculation and
    reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles for
    the three years ended December 31, 2007

tax benefits and gain on sales, net of taxes, is defined as net

    basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation. We consider
    FFO with
    RE


tax benefits and gain on sales, net of taxes, to be a meaningful
    supplemental measure of performance because the short-term use
    of funds produce a profit that differs from the traditional
    long-term investment in real estate for REITs.

FFO also does not represent cash generated from operating
    activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and therefore should not be considered an
    alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as
    determined by generally accepted accounting principles, as a
    measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily
    indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs. A

Results
    of Operations

The following discussion includes the results of both continuing
    and discontinued operations for the periods presented.

Net
    Income Available to Common Stockholders

2007-vs.-2006

Net income available to common stockholders was
    $205.2 million ($1.53 per diluted share) for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to $113.2 million ($0.85
    per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007, when
    compared to the same period in 2006, resulted primarily from the
    following items, all of which are discussed in further detail
    elsewhere within this Report:

•

$107.6 million more in gains recognized from the sale of
    depreciable property in 2007,

•

$11.4 million more in apartment community operating results
    in 2007,

•

$3.2 million less in interest expense in 2007, and

•

$1.5 million less in distributions on preferred shares in
    2007.



These increases in income were partially offset by a
    $13.6 million increase in real estate depreciation and
    amortization expense, an $8.4 million increase in general
    and administrative expense, $4.3 million in severance costs
    and other restructuring charges in 2007, $2.3 million in
    premiums on preferred stock repurchases in 2007, and a
    $0.9 million decrease in non-property income during 2007
    when compared to 2006.

2006-vs.-2005

Net income available to common stockholders was
    $113.2 million ($0.85 per diluted share) for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to $139.8 million ($1.03
    per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2005,
    representing a decrease of $26.6 million ($0.18 per diluted
    share). The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    when compared to the same period in 2005, resulted primarily
    from the following items, all of which are discussed in further
    detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

$31.7 million more in depreciation and amortization expense
    in 2006,

•

$18.5 million more in interest expense in 2006,

•

$17.1 million less in non-property income in 2006, and

•

$6.4 million more in general and administrative expense in
    2006.

These decreases in net income were partially offset by
    $5.1 million more in gains recognized from the sale of
    depreciable property and an unconsolidated joint venture, an
    $8.5 million decrease in losses on early debt retirement,
    and a $34.2 million increase in apartment community
    operating results in 2006 when compared to 2005.

Apartment
    Community Operations

Our net income is primarily generated from the operation of our
    apartment communities. The following table summarizes the
    operating performance of our total apartment portfolio for each

2007-vs.-2006

Same Communities

Our same communities (those communities acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to December 31, 2006 and held on
    December 31, 2007, which consisted of 30,686 apartment
    homes) provided 57% of our property net operating income for the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

Same community property net operating income increased 7.0% or
    $17.7 million compared to 2006. The increase in property
    operating income was primarily attributable to a 5.0% or
    $18.8 million increase in revenues from rental and other
    income and a 0.9% or $1.1 million increase in operating
    expenses. The increase in revenues from rental and other income
    was primarily driven by a 4.2% or $16.2 million increase in
    rental rates, an 11.4% or $3.0 million increase in
    reimbursement income and fee income, and a 16.2% or
    $1.0 million decrease in rental concessions. These
    increases were partially offset by a 6.8% or $1.3 million
    increase in vacancy loss. Physical occupancy decreased 0.2% to
    94.6%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 5.2% or $1.8 million increase in real estate taxes
    that was partially offset by a 7.6% or $0.8 million
    decrease in administrative and marketing costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
    operating income divided by property rental income) increased
    1.3% to 68.2%.

Non-Mature
    Communities

The remaining 43% or $206.2 million of our property net
    operating income during the year ended December 31, 2007,
    was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities.” UDR’s non-mature
    communities consist primarily of communities acquired or
    developed in 2006 and 2007, sold properties, redevelopment
    properties, properties classified as real estate held for
    disposition and condominium properties.

The largest component our non-mature portfolio are those
    properties that are classified as real estate held for
    disposition. At December 31, 2007, UDR had 86 apartment
    communities, two condominium projects and one commercial unit
    included in real estate held held for disposition. For the year
    ended December 31, 2007, these communities provided
    $136.5 million of property net operating income.



2006-vs.-2005

Same Communities

Our same communities (those communities acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to December 31, 2005 and held on
    December 31, 2006, which consisted of 60,062 apartment
    homes) provided 82% of our property operating income for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, same community
    property operating income increased 8.6% or $30.4 million
    compared to 2005. The increase in property operating income was
    primarily attributable to a 6.0% or $34.2 million increase
    in revenues from rental and other income that was offset by a
    1.8% or $3.9 million increase in operating expenses. The
    increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily
    driven by a 4.9% or $28.4 million increase in rental rates,
    a 17.6% or $2.2 million decrease in rental concessions, and
    a 12.5% or $5.0 million increase in utility reimbursement
    income and fee income. Physical occupancy increased 0.1% to
    94.7%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 15.8% or $1.6 million increase in insurance costs, a
    4.4% or $1.5 million increase in utility costs, a 2.8% or
    $1.5 million increase in personnel costs, a 1.1% or
    $0.4 million increase in repair and maintenance expenses,
    and a 0.5% or $0.3 million increase in real estate taxes.
    These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a
    6.0% or $1.2 million decrease in administrative and
    marketing expenses.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin increased
    1.5% to 63.5%.

Non-Mature
    Communities

The remaining 18% of our property operating income during 2006
    was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities,” UDR’s non-mature
    communities consist primarily of communities acquired or
    developed in 2005 and 2006, sold properties, redevelopment
    properties, properties classified as real estate held for
    disposition and condominium properties.

Real
    Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2007, real estate
    depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
    discontinued operations increased $13.6 million or 5.6%
    compared to 2006, primarily due to the significant increase in
    per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio and
    other capital expenditures.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, real estate
    depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
    discontinued operations increased $31.7 million or 14.8%
    compared to 2005, primarily due to the significant increase in
    per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio and
    other capital expenditures.

Interest
    Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2007, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 1.7% or
    $3.2 million compared to 2006. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the weighted average amount of debt
    outstanding increased 5.9% or $193.8 million compared to
    2006 and the weighted average interest rate decreased from 5.4%
    in 2006 to 5.3% in 2007. The weighted average amount of debt
    outstanding during 2007 is slightly higher than 2006 as
    acquisition costs in 2007 have been funded primarily by the
    issuance of debt. The decrease in the weighted average interest
    rate during 2007 reflects short-term bank borrowings and
    variable rate debt that had lower interest rates in 2007 when
    compared to the same period in 2006.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations increased
    $18.5 million or 11.3% from 2005 primarily due to the
    issuance of debt and higher interest rates. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the weighted average amount of debt
    outstanding increased 11.7% or $350.4 million compared to
    2005 and the weighted average interest rate increased from 5.3%
    to 5.4% during 2006. The weighted average amount of debt
    outstanding during 2006 is higher than 2005 as acquisition costs



in 2005 and in 2006 have been funded primarily by the issuance
    of debt. The increase in the weighted average interest rate
    during 2006 reflects short-term bank borrowings and variable
    rate debt that had higher interest rates when compared to the
    prior year that were partially offset by the retirement of
    higher coupon debt with lower coupon debt.

General
    and Administrative

For the year ended December 31, 2007, general and
    administrative expenses increased $8.4 million or 26.8%
    compared to 2006. The increase was due to a number of factors,
    including increases in personnel costs, incentive compensation,
    and legal and professional fees.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, general and
    administrative expenses increased $6.4 million or 25.7%
    over 2005 due to a number of factors, including increases in
    personnel expense, incentive compensation, professional fees,
    dead deal costs, and an operating lease on an airplane.

Severance
    Costs and Other Restructuring Charges

For the year ended December 31, 2007, UDR recognized
    $4.3 million in severance costs and other restructuring
    charges. UDR is establishing Highlands Ranch, Colorado, as its
    corporate headquarters and is realigning resources to improve
    efficiencies and centralize job functions in fewer locations. As
    a result of a comprehensive review of the organizational
    structure of UDR and its operations, UDR recorded a charge of
    $3.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2007 related to
    workforce reductions, relocation costs, and other related costs.
    These charges are included in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations within the line item “Severance costs and other
    restructuring charges.” All charges were approved by
    management and our Board of Directors in October 2007, and all
    of the $3.6 million charge will be paid during 2008.

Premium
    on Preferred Stock Repurchases

In May 2007, we exercised our right to redeem all of our shares
    of our 8.60% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock
    for a cash redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends to the redemption date. The premium amount
    recognized to repurchase these shares represents the cumulative
    accretion to date between the repurchase value of the preferred
    stock and the value at which it was recorded at the time of
    issuance.

Hurricane
    Related Insurance Recoveries

In 2005, $2.5 million of hurricane related insurance
    recoveries were recorded related to damages in Florida caused by
    hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne in 2004. UDR reported
    that 25 of our 34 Florida communities were affected by the
    hurricanes.

Gains on
    the Sale of Land and Depreciable Property

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we
    recognized after-tax gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $256.2 million, $148.6 million and
    $143.5 million, respectively. Changes in the level of gains
    recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of
    our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the
    extent of gains related to specific properties sold.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. Substantially all of our leases
    are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our
    risk from the adverse effects of inflation.



Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or
    are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our
    financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or
    expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
    or capital resources that are material.

Factors
    Affecting Our Business and Prospects

There are many factors that affect our business and the results
    of our operations, some of which are beyond our control. These
    factors include:

•

unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions
    that could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates,

•

the failure of acquisitions to achieve anticipated results,

•

possible difficulty in selling apartment communities,

•

the timing and closing of planned dispositions under agreement,

•

competitive factors that may limit our ability to lease
    apartment homes or increase or maintain rents,

•

insufficient cash flow that could affect our debt financing and
    create refinancing risk,

•

failure to generate sufficient revenue, which could impair our
    debt service payments and distributions to stockholders,

•

development and construction risks that may impact our
    profitability,

•

potential damage from natural disasters, including hurricanes
    and other weather-related events, which could result in
    substantial costs to us,

•

risks from extraordinary losses for which we may not have
    insurance or adequate reserves,

•

uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insurance
    retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess
    of applicable coverage,

•

delays in completing developments and

lease-ups

on
    schedule,

•

our failure to succeed in new markets,

•

changing interest rates, which could increase interest costs and
    affect the market price of our securities,

•

potential liability for environmental contamination, which could

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2007, we carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures
    are designed with the objective of ensuring that information
    required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
    alerting them to material information required to be included in
    our periodic SEC reports.

It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is
    based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
    future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
    will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
    future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective under
    circumstances where our disclosure controls and procedures
    should reasonably be expected to operate effectively.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

UDR’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, UDR’s Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting based on the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO).

Based on UDR’s evaluation, management concluded that our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2007.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Report, has audited UDR’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of



December 31, 2007. The report of Ernst & Young
    LLP, which expresses an unqualified opinion on UDR’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, is included under the heading
    “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” contained in
    this Report.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
    concluded that during the quarter ended December 31, 2007,
    there has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
    to materially affect, our internal control over financial
    reporting.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

Board of
    Directors and Stockholders

UDR, Inc.

We have audited UDR Inc.’s (the “Company”)
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting included at Item 9A. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007 of UDR, Inc.
    and our report dated February 25, 2008 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Stockholders

UDR, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    UDR, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of UDR, Inc. at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 25, 2008 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER
    31, 2007

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization
    and formation

UDR, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was formed in 1972. We have
    activities related to the ownership, management, development,
    acquisition, renovation, and disposition of multifamily
    apartment communities nationwide. At December 31, 2007, we
    owned 234 communities.

Basis of
    presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of UDR and its subsidiaries, including United Dominion
    Realty, L.P., (the “Operating Partnership”), and
    Heritage Communities L.P. (the “Heritage OP”),
    (collectively, “UDR”). As of December 31, 2007,
    there were 166,130,747 units in the Operating Partnership
    outstanding, of which 157,477,187 units or 95% were owned
    by UDR and 8,653,560 units or 5% were owned by limited
    partners. As of December 31, 2007, there were
    5,542,200 units in the Heritage OP outstanding, of which
    5,225,748 units or 94% were owned by UDR and
    316,452 units or 6% were owned by limited partners. The
    consolidated financial statements of UDR include the minority
    interests of the unitholders in the Operating Partnership and
    the Heritage OP. All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of these financial statements requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
    contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements
    and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual amounts realized or paid could differ from those
    estimates. Certain previously reported amounts have been
    reclassified to conform to the current financial statement
    presentation.

Real
    estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical
    cost less accumulated depreciation and any recorded impairment
    losses.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are
    charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements,
    renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition

and/or

improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost and
    depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the
    expenditures qualify as a betterment or the life of the related
    asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life
    expectancy.

UDR recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
    operations when there is an event or change in circumstance that
    indicates an impairment in the value of an asset and the
    undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the
    asset’s carrying value. Our cash flow estimates are based
    upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of
    future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding
    periods. If such indicators of impairment are present, an
    impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the
    carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Our estimates
    of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon
    industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

UDR purchases real estate investment properties from time to
    time and allocates the purchase price to various components,
    such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place
    leases in accordance with FASB Statement No. 141,
    “Business Combinations.” The purchase price is
    allocated based on the relative fair value of each component.
    The fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings
    were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market
    rental rates. As such, the determination of fair value considers



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated
    from the property including an initial lease up period. UDR
    determines the fair value of in-place leases by assessing the
    net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to
    market terms for similar leases at acquisition. The fair value
    of in-place leases is recorded and amortized as amortization
    expense over the remaining contractual lease period. UDR
    determines the fair value of in-place leases by considering the
    cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated
    with the

lease-up

period, and the carrying costs associated with the

lease-up

period.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are
    recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost
    to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition generally
    represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted
    for sale which are expected to close within the next twelve
    months. Real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower
    of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less
    the cost to dispose, determined on an

asset-by-asset

basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on
    held for disposition properties are charged to expense as
    incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and
    replacements related to held for disposition properties are
    capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate
    held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets which is
    35 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major
    improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures,
    equipment, and other assets. The value of acquired in-place
    leases is amortized over the remaining term of each acquired
    in-place lease.

All development projects and related carrying costs are
    capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
    “Real estate under development.” As each building in a
    project is completed and becomes available for

lease-up,

the total cost of the building is transferred to real estate
    held for investment and the assets are depreciated over their
    estimated useful lives. The cost of development projects
    includes interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated
    development overhead during the construction period.

Interest, real estate taxes, and incremental labor and support
    costs for personnel working directly on the development site are
    capitalized as part of the real estate under development to the
    extent that such charges do not cause the carrying value of the
    asset to exceed its net realizable value. During 2007, 2006, and
    2005, total interest capitalized was $13.2 million,
    $5.2 million, and $2.8 million, respectively.

Cash
    equivalents

Cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with
    maturities of three months or less when purchased.

Restricted
    cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for
    real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and
    security deposits.

Deferred
    financing costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and other external costs
    incurred to obtain debt financings and are generally amortized
    on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective
    interest method, over a period not to exceed the term of the
    related debt. Unamortized financing costs are written-off when
    debt is retired before its maturity date. During 2007, 2006, and
    2005, amortization expense was $7.3 million,
    $6.1 million, and $6.5 million, respectively.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Consolidation
    of joint venture partnerships

FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46,
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,”
    requires the Company to consolidate the assets, liabilities and
    results of operations of the activities of a variable interest
    entity if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the variable
    interest entity. The primary beneficiary is the partner that is
    entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual
    returns

and/or

is
    subject to a majority of the risk of loss from such
    entity’s activities. As of December 31, 2007, UDR has
    one development joint venture partnership in Marina del Rey,
    California, that is consolidated under FIN 46.

Investments
    in unconsolidated joint ventures

Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for
    using the equity method when major business decisions require
    approval by the other partners and UDR does not have control of
    the assets or if the venture is a variable interest entity, but
    the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Investments are
    recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in net
    income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions. UDR
    eliminates intercompany profits on sales of services that are
    provided to joint ventures. Differences between the carrying
    value of investments and the underlying equity in net assets of
    the investee are due to capitalized interest on the investment
    balance and capitalized development and leasing costs that are
    recovered by UDR through fees earned during construction. At
    December 31, 2007, UDR has three unconsolidated development
    joint ventures and one unconsolidated operating joint ventures
    that are accounted for under the equity method.

Revenue
    recognition

UDR’s apartment homes are leased under operating leases
    with terms generally of one year or less. Rental income is
    recognized as it is earned.

Advertising
    costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item
    “Administrative and marketing.” During 2007, 2006, and
    2005, total advertising expense was $7.8 million,
    $9.3 million, and $11.2 million, respectively.

Comprehensive
    income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in equity
    during each period except for those resulting from investments
    by or distributions to stockholders, is displayed in the
    accompanying Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. For the
    year ended December 31, 2007, other comprehensive income
    consists of an unrealized loss from derivative financial
    instruments on an unconsolidated development joint venture in
    which UDR has a 49% interest.

Stock-based
    employee compensation plans

UDR adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for
    share-based payments effective January 1, 2004 using the
    prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148

,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure.” UDR adopted FASB Statement No.
    123(R), “Share-Based Payments,” (FAS 123(R)) on
    January 1, 2006 and has continued to use the
    Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the value of stock
    options granted to employees, which have not been granted since
    2002. FAS 123(R) must be applied not only to new awards but
    to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the
    effective date (as of January 1, 2006, there were no
    unvested stock options). UDR adopted FAS 123(R) using the
    modified prospective transition method (which applied only to
    awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date).
    The adoption of the provisions of FAS 123(R) did not have a
    material impact on our financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Minority
    interests of unitholders in operating partnerships

Interests in operating partnerships held by limited partners are
    represented by operating partnership units
    (“OP Units”). The operating partnerships’
    income is allocated to holders of OP Units based upon net
    income available to common stockholders and the weighted average
    number of OP Units outstanding to total common shares plus
    OP Units outstanding during the period. Capital
    contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are
    allocated to minority interests in accordance with the terms of
    the individual partnership agreements. OP Units can be
    exchanged for cash or shares of UDR’s common stock on a
    one-for-one basis, at the option of UDR. OP Units, as a
    percentage of total OP Units and shares outstanding, were
    5.4% at December 31, 2007, 6.1% at December 31, 2006,
    and 5.9% at December 31, 2005.

Minority
    interests of outside partnerships

UDR has limited partners in certain real estate partnerships
    acquired in certain merger transactions. Net income for these
    partnerships is allocated based upon the percentage interest
    owned by these limited partners in each respective real estate
    partnership.

Earnings
    per share

Basic earnings per common share is computed based upon the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based upon
    common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive stock
    options and other potentially dilutive common stock equivalents.
    The dilutive effect of stock options and other potentially
    dilutive common stock equivalents is determined using the
    treasury stock method based on UDR’s average stock price.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
    diluted earning per share

    share amounts):

    three years ended December 31, 2007, would be 7,762,070,
    8,693,981 and 8,545,786 weighted average common shares,
    respectively.

If the Series A Out-Performance Partnership Shares were
    converted to common stock, the additional shares of common stock
    outstanding for the three years ended December 31, 2007,
    would be 0, 1,716,659 and 1,778,251 weighted average common
    shares, respectively. The Series A limited liability company was
    dissolved as of December 21, 2007.

At December 31, 2007, if the measurement periods had ended
    on that date, no Series C, D or E Out-Performance
    Partnership Shares would have been issued had each Program
    terminated on that date. Accordingly, no additional operating
    partnership units would have been issued at that date.

At December 31, 2006, if the measurement periods had ended
    on that date, Series C and D Out-Performance Partnership
    Shares would have been issued if each Program terminated on that
    date. Accordingly, 713,790 and 799,459 operating partnership
    units, respectively, would have been issued had the measurement
    periods ended on that date; however, those units have been
    excluded in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
    because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

If the convertible preferred stock were converted to common
    stock, the additional shares of common stock outstanding for the
    years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, would be 2,803,812
    weighted average common shares.

Income
    taxes

UDR is operated as, and elects to be taxed as, a real estate
    investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Generally, a
    REIT complies with the provisions of the Code if it meets
    certain requirements concerning its income and assets, as well
    as if it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to
    its stockholders and will not be subject to U.S. federal
    income taxes if it distributes at least 100% of its income.
    Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes
    of the REIT. UDR is subject to certain state and local excise or
    franchise taxes, for which provision has been made. If we fail
    to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, our taxable income
    will be subject to United States Federal income tax at regular
    corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum
    tax). Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain
    state and local income taxes and to United States Federal income
    tax. We also will be required to pay a 100% tax on non-arms
    length transactions between us and a taxable REIT subsidiary and
    on any net income from sales of property that the IRS
    successfully asserts was property held for sale to customers in
    the ordinary course.

The differences between net income available to common
    stockholders for financial reporting purposes and taxable income
    before dividend deductions relate primarily to temporary
    differences, principally real estate depreciation and the tax
    deferral of certain gains on property sales. The differences in
    depreciation result from differences in the book and tax basis
    of certain real estate assets and the differences in the methods
    of depreciation and lives of the real estate assets.

Impact of
    recently issued accounting pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,” (“FAS 157”)
    and in February 2007, Statement No. 159, “The Fair
    Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities,” (“FAS 159”). FAS 157
    increases the consistency and comparability in fair value
    measurements and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. FAS 159 allows an entity to make a one-time
    election to measure many financial assets and financial
    liabilities at fair value (the “fair value option”).
    The election is made on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis and is irrevocable. If the fair value option is elected
    for an instrument, this statement specifies that all subsequent
    changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in
    earnings. Both

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. UDR does not believe the provisions of
    FAS 157 related to financial assets and liabilities will have a
    material impact on its consolidated financial statements. UDR is
    still assessing the impact of the provisions of FAS 157 related
    to non-financial assets and liabilities on its consolidated
    financial statements. UDR does not believe the provisions of FAS
    159 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued “Business
    Combinations,” (“FAS 141R”). FAS 141R establishes
    principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The statement also
    provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill
    acquired in the business combination, recognizing assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, and
    determining what information to disclose to enable users of the
    financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects
    of the business combination. FAS 141R is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008.

In December 2007, the FASB issued “Non-controlling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“FAS
    160”). FAS 160 amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and
    reporting standards for the non-controlling (minority) interest
    in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It
    clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary should
    be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.
    Consolidated net income should include the net income for both
    the parent and the non-controlling interest with disclosure of
    both amounts on the consolidated statement of operations. The
    calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on
    income amounts attributable to the parent. FAS 160 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.

INCOME
    FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

FASB Statement No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
    or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”
    (FAS 144) requires, among other things, that the
    primary assets and liabilities and the results of operations of
    UDR’s real properties which have been sold or are held for
    disposition, be classified as discontinued operations and
    segregated in UDR’s Consolidated Statements of Operations
    and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Properties classified as real
    estate held for disposition generally represent properties that
    are actively marketed or contracted for sale which are expected
    to close within the next twelve months.

For purposes of these financial statements, FAS 144 results
    in the presentation of the primary assets and liabilities and
    the net operating results of those properties sold or classified
    as held for disposition through December 31, 2007, as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented. FAS 144
    does not have an impact on net income available to common
    stockholders. FAS 144 only results in the reclassification
    of the operating results of all properties sold or classified as
    held for disposition through December 31, 2007, within the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, and the reclassification
    of the assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, UDR sold 21
    communities, 61 condominiums from two communities with a total
    of 640 condominiums, and one parcel of land. UDR recognized
    after-tax gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $256.2 million on these sales, of which $142.4 million
    are included in discontinued operations. The remaining
    $113.8 million of gains recognized, related to our sale of
    nine communities and the contribution of one development
    property, at cost, to a joint venture in which UDR will hold a
    20% interest, is reported as a component of continuing
    operations as disclosed in Note 4 — Joint Ventures. At
    December 31, 2007, UDR had 86 communities with a net book
    value of $885.5 million, two communities with a total of
    579 condominiums and a net book value of
    $40.8 million, and one commercial unit with a net book
    value of $0.4 million included in real estate held for
    disposition.

During 2006, UDR sold 24 communities and 384 condominiums from
    four communities with a total of 612 condominiums. We recognized
    gains for financial reporting purposes of $148.6 million on
    these sales. During 2005, UDR sold 22 communities, 240
    condominiums from five communities with a total of
    648 condominiums, and one parcel of land. We recognized
    gains for financial reporting purposes of $139.7 million on
    these sales. In conjunction with the sale of ten properties in
    July 2005, UDR received short-term notes for $124.7 million
    that bear interest at 6.75% and had maturities ranging from
    September 2005 to July 2006. As of December 31, 2006, all
    of the notes receivable had matured and had been repaid.
    Previously deferred gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $6.4 million were recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The results of operations for these
    properties and the interest expense associated with the secured
    debt on these properties are classified on the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations in the line item entitled “Income
    from discontinued operations, net of minority interests.”

JOINT
    VENTURES

Consolidated
    Development Joint Venture

In June 2006, we completed the formation of a development joint
    venture that will invest approximately $138 million to
    develop one apartment community with 298 apartment homes in
    Marina del Rey, California. UDR is the financial partner and is
    responsible for funding the costs of development and receives a
    preferred return from 7% to 8.5% before our partner receives a
    50% participation. Our initial investment was
    $27.5 million. Under FASB Interpretation No. 46,
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” this
    venture has been consolidated into UDR’s financial
    statements. Our joint venture partner is the managing partner as
    well as the developer, general contractor, and property manager.
    The project is currently expected to be completed in the second
    quarter of 2008.

Unconsolidated
    Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2007, UDR had investments in the
    following unconsolidated joint ventures which are accounted for
    under the equity method of accounting:

UDR is a partner in a joint venture to develop a site in
    Bellevue, Washington. At closing, we owned 49% of the project
    that involves building a 430 home high rise apartment building
    with ground floor retail. Our initial investment was
    $5.7 million. The project is currently expected to be
    completed in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our investment at
    December 31, 2007 was $8.1 million.

UDR is a partner in a joint venture which will develop 274
    apartment homes in the central business district of Bellevue,
    Washington. Construction began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and
    is scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2008. At
    closing, we owned 49% of the project. Our initial investment was
    $10.0 million. Our investment at December 31, 2007 and
    2006 was $8.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In January 2007, UDR and an unaffiliated partner formed a joint
    venture which owns and operates a recently completed 23-story,
    166 apartment home high rise community in the central business
    district of Bellevue, Washington. At closing, UDR owned 49% of
    the project (subject to a $34 million mortgage). Our
    initial investment was $11.8 million. Our investment at
    December 31, 2007 was $11.2 million.

In November 2007, UDR and an unaffiliated partner formed a joint
    venture which owns and operates various properties located in
    Texas. On the closing date, UDR sold nine operating properties,
    consisting of 3,690 units, and contributed one property
    under development, at cost, to the joint venture. The property
    under development will have 302 units and is expected to be
    completed in the third quarter of 2008. UDR contributed cash and
    property equal to 20% of the fair value of the properties. The
    unaffiliated partner contributed cash equal to 80% of the fair
    value of the properties comprising the venture, which was then
    used to purchase the nine operating properties from UDR. Our
    initial investment was $20.4 million. Our investment at
    December 31, 2007 was $20.1 million.

In accordance with

EITF No. 03-13,

the cash flows of the Texas joint venture assets have been
    classified as a component of continuing operations on the
    Consolidated Statement of Operations as UDR will recognize
    significant direct cash flows from the disposed properties over
    the duration of the venture arrangement.

During the first quarter of 2005, we prepaid approximately
    $110 million of secured debt. In conjunction with these
    prepayments, we incurred prepayment penalties of
    $8.5 million in both continuing and discontinued operations
    as “Loss on early debt retirement.” These penalties
    were funded by the proceeds from the sale of our technology
    investment of $12.3 million.

On July 27, 2007, UDR amended and restated its existing
    three-year $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit
    facility with a maturity date of May 31, 2008, (which can
    be extended for an additional year at UDR’s option) to
    increase the facility to $600 million and extend its
    maturity to July 26, 2012. The terms of the
    $600 million credit facility provide that UDR has the right
    to increase the credit facility to $750 million under
    certain circumstances. Based on UDR’s current credit
    ratings, the $600 million credit facility carries an
    interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 47.5 basis
    points. Under a competitive bid feature and for so long as UDR
    maintains an Investment Grade Rating, UDR has the right to bid
    out 50% of the commitment amount under the $600 million
    credit facility and can bid out 100% of the commitment amount
    once per quarter.

Preferred
    Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock has no
    stated par value and a liquidation preference of $16.61 per
    share. Subject to certain adjustments and conditions, each share
    of the Series E is convertible at any time and from time to
    time at the holder’s option into one share of our common
    stock. The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on
    an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the
    holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for
    the election of directors or for any other purpose on which the
    holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E
    has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or
    any mandatory redemption.

Distributions declared on the Series E in 2007 were $1.33
    per share. The Series E is not listed on any exchange. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, a total of
    2,803,812 shares of the Series E were outstanding.

In May 2007, UDR sold 5,400,000 shares of our 6.75%
    Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The
    Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock has no
    stated par value and a liquidation preference of $25 per share.
    The Series G generally has no voting rights except under
    certain limited circumstances and as required by law. The
    Series G has no stated maturity and is not subject to any
    sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not convertible into
    any of our other securities. The Series G is not redeemable
    prior to May 31, 2012. On or after this date, the
    Series G may be redeemed for cash at our option, in whole
    or in part, at a redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued
    and unpaid dividends. All dividends due and payable on the
    Series G have been accrued or paid as of the end of each
    fiscal year.

Distributions declared on the Series G in 2007 were $1.13
    per share. The Series G is listed on the NYSE under the
    symbol “UDRPrG.” At December 31, 2007, a total of
    5,400,000 shares of the Series G were outstanding.

UDR is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of our
    Series F Preferred Stock. The Series F Preferred Stock
    may be purchased by holders of UDR’s operating partnership
    units, or OP Units, at a purchase price of $0.0001 per
    share. OP Unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and
    purchase one share of UDR’s Series F Preferred Stock
    for each OP Unit held. At December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    a total of 666,293 shares of the Series F Preferred
    Stock were outstanding at a value of $66.63. Holders of the
    Series F Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for each
    share of the Series F Preferred Stock they hold, voting
    together with the holders of our common stock, on each matter
    submitted to a vote of security holders at a meeting of our
    stockholders. The Series F Preferred Stock does not entitle
    its holders to any other rights, privileges or preferences.

In May 2007, UDR completed the redemption of all of its
    outstanding 8.60% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
    Stock at $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends using
    the net proceeds from the Series G Cumulative Redeemable
    Preferred Stock offering. Distributions declared on the
    Series B in 2007 were $1.07 per share.

Dividend
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

UDR’s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the
    “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows common and preferred
    stockholders the opportunity to purchase, through the
    reinvestment of cash dividends, additional shares of UDR’s
    common stock. As of December 31, 2007,
    9,957,233 shares of common stock had been issued under the
    Stock Purchase Plan. Shares in the amount of 15,042,767 were

Restricted
    Stock Awards

UDR’s 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
    authorizes the grant of restricted stock awards to employees,
    officers, consultants, and directors of UDR. Compensation
    expense is recorded over the vesting period and is based upon
    the value of the common stock on the date of issuance. For the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized
    $6.1 million, $4.5 million, and $3.2 million,
    respectively, of compensation expense related to the
    amortization of restricted stock. As of December 31, 2007,
    1,361,282 shares of restricted stock have been issued under
    the LTIP.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

UDR’s First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement was
    intended to protect long-term interests of stockholders in the
    event of an unsolicited, coercive or unfair attempt to take over
    UDR. The plan authorized a dividend of one Preferred Share
    Purchase Right (the “Rights”) on each share of common
    stock outstanding. Each Right entitled the holder to purchase


/


of a share of a new series of UDR’s preferred stock,
    designated as Series C Junior Participating Cumulative
    Preferred Stock, at a price to be determined upon the occurrence
    of the event, and for which the holder must be paid $45 should
    the takeover occur. Under the Plan, the Rights were exercisable
    if a person or group acquired more than 15% of UDR’s common
    stock or announced a tender offer that would result in the
    ownership of 15% of UDR’s common stock. The Rights expired
    on February 4, 2008.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

The following estimated fair values of financial instruments
    were determined by UDR using available market information and
    appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is
    necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair
    values. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not
    necessarily indicative of the amounts UDR would realize on the
    disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different
    market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a
    material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The
    carrying amounts and estimated fair value of UDR’s
    financial instruments, where different, as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, are summarized as follows

The following methods and assumptions were used by UDR in
    estimating fair values.

Cash
    equivalents

The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Notes
    receivable

In June 2003, UDR received a promissory note in the principal
    amount of $5 million that is due October 2011. The note was
    received in connection with one of our acquisitions and bears
    interest of 9.0% that is payable in annual installments. The
    carrying amount of this note receivable approximates its fair
    value.

At December 31, 2007, UDR has a promissory note in the
    principal amount of $1.5 million that is due in February
    2016. The note was received in connection with our investment in
    the development of an online leasing software and bears interest
    at 10.0%. The carrying amount of this note receivable
    approximates its fair value.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In August 2007, UDR received a convertible secured promissory
    note from a marketing and consulting firm, in the principal
    amount of $300,000. As of December 31, 2007, $150,000 has
    been drawn on the note, which represents the first of three
    scheduled draws. The note will become fully due and payable in
    August 2009 unless paid sooner or converted in accordance with
    the terms of the note. The carrying amount of this note
    receivable approximates its fair value.

In November 2007, UDR entered into a construction loan agreement
    with an initial principal amount of $6.0 million that is
    due in October 2008. The note can be drawn up to a maximum of
    approximately $20.2 million. The note was received in
    connection with our investment in a development joint venture.
    The carrying amount of this note receivable approximates its
    fair value.

Secured
    and unsecured debt

Estimated fair value is based on mortgage rates, tax-exempt bond
    rates, and corporate unsecured debt rates believed to be
    available to UDR for the issuance of debt with similar terms and
    remaining lives. The carrying amount of UDR’s variable rate
    secured debt approximates fair value as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006. The carrying amounts of UDR’s borrowings
    under variable rate unsecured debt arrangements, short-term
    revolving credit agreements, and lines of credit approximate
    their fair values as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

9.

INCOME
    TAXES

The aggregate cost of our real estate assets for federal income
    tax purposes was approximately $5.5 billion at
    December 31, 2007.

UDR adopted FASB Interpretation 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), on
    January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of
    FIN 48, UDR recognized no material adjustments to
    liabilities related to unrecognized income tax benefits. At the
    adoption date of January 1, 2007, UDR’s taxable REIT
    subsidiaries had $538,000 of net unrecognized tax benefits,
    which would favorably impact our effective tax rate if
    recognized. At December 31, 2007, UDR had $415,000 of net
    unrecognized tax benefits. UDR and its subsidiaries are subject
    to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of
    multiple state jurisdictions. The tax years 2004 —
    2007 remain open to examination by the major taxing
    jurisdictions to which we are subject. UDR recognizes interest

and/or

penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax
    expense. As of December 31, 2007, UDR had $62,000 accrued
    for interest and $0 accrued for penalties.

For income tax purposes, distributions paid to common
    stockholders may consist of ordinary income, capital gains, and
    non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof.
    Distributions that exceed our current and accumulated earnings
    and profits constitute a return of capital rather than taxable
    income and reduce the stockholder’s basis in their common
    shares. To the extent that a distribution exceeds both current
    and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder’s
    basis in the common shares, it generally will be treated as a
    gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder’s common
    shares. For the three years ended December 31, 2007,

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

Profit
    Sharing Plan

Our Profit Sharing Plan (the “Plan”) is a defined
    contribution plan covering all eligible full-time employees.
    Under the Plan, UDR makes discretionary profit sharing and
    matching contributions to the Plan as determined by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Aggregate
    provisions for contributions, both matching and discretionary,
    which are included in UDR’s Consolidated Statements of
    Operations for the three years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006, and 2005 were $0.8 million, $0.7 million, and
    $0.6 million, respectively.

Stock
    Option Plan

In May 2001, the stockholders of UDR approved the 1999 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”), which supersedes the 1985
    Stock Option Plan. With the approval of the LTIP, no additional
    grants will be made under the 1985 Stock Option Plan. The LTIP
    authorizes the granting of awards which may take the form of
    options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation
    rights, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, other
    stock-based awards, and any other right or interest relating to
    common stock or cash. The Board of Directors reserved four
    million shares for issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards
    under the LTIP. The LTIP generally provides, among other things,
    that options are granted at exercise prices not lower than the



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

market value of the shares on the date of grant and that options
    granted must be exercised within ten years. The maximum number
    of shares of stock that may be issued subject to incentive stock
    options is four million shares. Shares under options that expire
    or are cancelable are available for subsequent grant.

UDR adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for
    share-based payments effective January 1, 2004, using the
    prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148

,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure.” UDR adopted FAS 123(R) on
    January 1, 2006, and has continued to use the
    Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the value of stock
    options granted to employees, which have not been granted since
    2002. FAS 123(R) must be applied not only to new awards but to
    previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the
    effective date (as of January 1, 2006, there were no
    unvested stock options). UDR adopted FAS 123(R) using the
    modified prospective transition method (which applied only to
    awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date).
    The adoption of the provisions of FAS 123(R) did not have a
    material impact on our financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

    years ended December 31, 2007, is provided in the following

Commitments

Real
    Estate Under Development

UDR is committed to completing its wholly owned real estate
    currently under development, which has an estimated cost to
    complete of $293.9 million as of December 31, 2007.

UDR is committed to completing its development joint venture
    projects, which have an estimated cost to complete of
    $173.2 million at December 31, 2007. The estimated
    cost to complete consists of $14.8 million

related to a consolidated joint venture and $158.4 million
    related to two unconsolidated joint ventures in which UDR owns
    49% and one unconsolidated joint venture in which UDR owns 20%.
    These projects are expected to be completed at various times
    between the second quarter of 2008 and the fourth quarter of
    2010.

UDR has entered into four contracts to purchase apartment
    communities upon their development completion. Provided that the
    developer meets certain conditions, UDR will purchase these
    communities for approximately $155 million. These apartment
    communities are expected to be completed at various times
    between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of
    2009.

Land and
    Other Leases

UDR is party to several ground leases relating to operating
    communities. In addition, UDR is party to various other
    operating leases related to the operation of its regional
    offices and equipment. Future minimum lease payments for
    non-cancelable land and other leases as of December 31,
    2007 are as follows

    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.

In January 2008, we executed our option to purchase land for
    $9.0 million that had been previously leased. The future
    minimum lease payments of $1.3 million related to this
    ground lease are included in the table above.

Contingencies

Series C
    Out-Performance Program

In May 2005, the stockholders of UDR approved a new
    Out-Performance Program and the first series of new
    Out-Performance Partnership Shares under the program are the
    Series C Out-Performance Units (the “Series C
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers and
    other key employees of UDR (the “Series C
    Participants”) were given the opportunity to invest
    indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests in UDR Out-Performance
    III, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
    “Series C LLC”), the only asset of which is a
    special class of partnership units of the Operating Partnership
    (“Series C Out-Performance Partnership Shares” or
    “Series C OPPSs”). The purchase price for the
    Series C OPPSs was determined by the Compensation Committee
    of UDR’s board of directors to be $750,000, assuming 100%
    participation, and was based upon the advice of an independent
    valuation expert. UDR’s performance for the Series C
    Program will be measured over the

36-month

period from June 1, 2005 to May 30, 2008.

The Series C Program is designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period is at least the
    equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized
    (“Minimum Return”).



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if UDR’s
    cumulative total return satisfies these criteria, the
    Series C LLC as holder of the Series C OPPSs will
    receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series C
    Participants as holders of interests in the Series C
    LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from
    the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and
    allocations that would be received on the number of
    OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of UDR’s common stock over the measurement period
    exceeds the Minimum Return (such excess being the “Excess
    Return”);

ii. multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by UDR’s
    market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares
    outstanding over the

36-month

period, including common stock, common stock equivalents and
    OP Units); and

iii. dividing the number obtained in clause (ii) by
    the market value of one share of UDR’s common stock on the
    valuation date, computed as the volume-weighted average price
    per day of common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
    preceding the valuation date.

For the Series C OPPSs, the number determined pursuant to
    (ii) above is capped at 1% of market capitalization.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of
    UDR’s common stock does not meet the Minimum Return, then
    the Series C Participants will forfeit their entire initial
    investment.

Based on the results through December 31, 2007, no
    Series C OPPSs would have been issued had the Program
    terminated on that date. However, since the ultimate
    determination of Series C OPPSs to be issued will not occur
    until May 30, 2008, and the number of Series C OPPSs
    is determinable only upon future events, the financial
    statements do not reflect any impact for these events.
    Accordingly, the contingently issuable Series C OPPSs will
    only be included in basic earnings per share after the
    measurement period has ended and the applicable hurdle has been
    met. Furthermore, the Series C OPPSs will only be included
    in common stock and common stock equivalents in the calculation
    of diluted earnings per share after the hurdle has been met at
    the end of the reporting period (if any), assuming the
    measurement period ended at the end of the reporting period.

Series D
    Out-Performance Program

In February 2006, the board of directors of UDR approved the
    Series D Out-Performance Program (the “Series D
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers of
    UDR (the “Series D Participants”) were given the
    opportunity to invest indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests
    in UDR Out-Performance IV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
    company (the “Series D LLC”), the only asset of
    which is a special class of partnership units of the Operating
    Partnership (“Series D Out-Performance Partnership
    Shares” or “Series D OPPSs”). The
    Series D Program is part of the New Out-Performance Program
    approved by UDR’s stockholders in May 2005. The
    Series D LLC has agreed to sell 830,000 membership units to
    certain members of UDR’s senior management at a price of
    $1.00 per unit. The aggregate purchase price of $830,000 for the
    Series D OPPSs, assuming 100% participation, is based upon
    the advice of an independent valuation expert. The Series D
    Program will measure the cumulative total return on our common
    stock over the

36-month

period beginning January 1, 2006 and ending
    December 31, 2008.

The Series D Program is designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period is at least the

Series E
    Out-Performance Program

In February 2007, the board of directors of UDR approved the
    Series E Out-Performance Program (the “Series E
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers of
    UDR (the “Series E Participants”) were given the
    opportunity to invest indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests
    in UDR Out-Performance V, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
    company (the “Series E LLC”), the only asset of
    which is a special class of partnership units of the Operating
    Partnership (“Series E Out-Performance Partnership
    Shares” or “Series E OPPSs”). The
    Series E Program is part of the New Out-Performance Program
    approved by UDR’s stockholders in May 2005. The
    Series E LLC has agreed to sell 805,000 membership units to
    certain members of UDR’s senior management at a price of
    $1.00 per unit. The aggregate purchase price of $805,000 for the
    Series E OPPSs, assuming 100% participation, is based upon
    the advice of an independent valuation expert. The Series E
    Program will measure the cumulative total return on our common

Litigation
    and Legal Matters

UDR is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising
    in the ordinary course of business. UDR cannot determine the
    ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and
    claims at this time. UDR believes that such liability, to the
    extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, will not
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flow.

12.

REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

FASB Statement No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of
    an Enterprise and Related Information,”
    (FAS 131”), requires that segment disclosures present
    the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker to
    decide how to allocate resources and for purposes of assessing
    such segments’ performance. UDR’s chief operating
    decision maker is comprised of several members of its executive
    management team who use several generally accepted industry
    financial measures to assess the performance of the business for
    our reportable operating segments.

UDR owns and operates multifamily apartment communities
    throughout the United States that generate rental and other
    property related income through the leasing of apartment homes
    to a diverse base of tenants. The primary financial measures for
    UDR’s apartment communities are rental income and net
    operating income (“NOI”). Rental income represents
    gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss
    and bad debt. NOI is defined as total revenues less direct
    property operating expenses. UDR’s chief operating decision
    maker utilizes NOI as the key measure of segment profit or loss.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

UDR’s two reportable segments are same communities and
    non-mature/other communities:

•

Same communities

represent those communities acquired,
    developed, and stabilized prior to December 31, 2006, and
    held as of December 31, 2007. A comparison of operating
    results from the prior year is meaningful as these communities
    were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses
    as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to
    conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community
    is not held for disposition within the current year. A community
    is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90%
    occupancy for at least three consecutive months.

•

Non-mature/other communities

represent those communities
    that were acquired or developed in 2006 and 2007, sold
    properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as
    real estate held for disposition, condominium conversion
    properties, joint venture properties, properties managed by
    third parties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use
    properties.

Executive management evaluates the performance of each of our
    apartment communities on a same community and non-mature/other
    basis, as well as individually and geographically. This is
    consistent with the aggregation criteria of FAS 131 as each
    of our apartment communities generally have similar economic
    characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore,
    UDR’s reportable segments have been aggregated by geography
    in a manner identical to that which is provided to the chief
    operating decision maker.

All revenues are from external customers and no single tenant or
    related group of tenants contributed 10% or more of UDR’s
    total revenues during the three years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006, or 2005.

The accounting policies applicable to the operating segments
    described above are the same as those described in Note 1,
    “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The
    following table details rental income and NOI for UDR’s
    reportable segments, for both continuing and discontinued
    operations, for the three years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006, and 2005, and reconciles NOI to net income per the

RESTRUCTURING
    CHARGES

UDR is establishing Highlands Ranch, Colorado, as its corporate
    headquarters and is realigning resources to improve efficiencies
    and centralize job functions in fewer locations. As a result of
    a comprehensive review of the organizational structure of UDR
    and its operations, UDR recorded a charge of $3.6 million
    during the fourth quarter of 2007 related to workforce
    reductions, relocation costs, and other related costs. These
    charges

The planned workforce reductions resulted in the termination of
    approximately 70 full-time equivalent positions, or
    approximately 20% of total staffing in corporate functions,
    including management and general and administrative functions,
    and in apartment operations. Employee termination benefits
    included severance packages and related benefits and
    outplacement services for employees terminated.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

In the fall of 2007, UDR commenced a formal plan of disposition
    for a portfolio of its properties. In January 2008, UDR
    announced that it had entered into an agreement dated
    January 23, 2008, to sell 86 communities for
    $1.7 billion. In accordance with FASB Statement
    No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets,” the primary assets and liabilities and
    results of operations of these properties have been classified
    as discontinued operations at December 31, 2007, and have
    been segregated in UDR’s Consolidated Statement of
    Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The transaction is expected to close on or about March 3,
    2008, at which time UDR will receive $1.5 billion in cash
    and will provide the buyer a note in the principal amount of
    $200 million. The note matures on the same date as the
    buyer’s senior financing, may be prepaid 14 months
    from the date of the note, bears interest at a fixed rate of
    7.5% per annum and is secured by a pledge and security agreement
    and a guarantee. Closing is subject to customary closing
    conditions. Upon completion of the transaction, UDR will own 148
    communities.

In January 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a new
    15 million share repurchase program. This program is in
    addition to our already existing 10 million share
    repurchase program. The program authorizes the repurchase of our
    common stock in open market purchases, in block purchases,
    privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise.
