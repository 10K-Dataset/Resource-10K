PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

UDR, Inc. is a self administered real estate investment trust,
    or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages
    apartment communities nationwide. At December 31, 2008, our
    wholly-owned apartment portfolio included 161 communities
    located in 23 markets, with a total of 44,388 completed
    apartment homes. In addition, we have an ownership interest in
    4,158 apartment units through joint ventures.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as
    the “Code”. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must
    continue to meet certain tests which, among other things,
    generally require that our assets consist primarily of real
    estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate
    assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable
    income (other than our net capital gain) to our stockholders
    annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject
    to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our
    net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our
    stockholders annually. In 2008, we declared total distributions
    on an adjusted basis of $2.11 per common share and a dividend of
    $0.89 per common share to our stockholders due to our
    disposition activities during 2008, which on a pre-adjusted
    dividend basis is $2.28 per common share, inclusive of a special
    dividend of $0.96 per common share to our stockholders. A
    detailed discussion of the special dividend and the accounting
    ramifications is included below under the heading “Special
    Dividend”.

We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003,
    we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland.
    Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive,
    Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado. As of
    February 12, 2009, we had 1,264 full-time employees
    and 74 part-time employees.

Our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships, Heritage
    Communities L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and United
    Dominion Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and RE3,
    our subsidiary that focuses on development, land entitlement and
    short-term hold investments. Unless the context otherwise
    requires, all references in this Report to “we,”
    “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or
    “UDR” refer collectively to UDR, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries.

Business
    Objectives

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic
    returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders
    with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve
    this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following
    goals and strategies:

•

own and operate apartments in markets that have the best growth
    prospects based on favorable job formation and low home
    affordability, thus enhancing stability and predictability of
    returns to our stockholders;

•

manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to
    buying, selling, and building apartment communities;

•

empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently
    and effectively;

•

measure and reward associates based on specific performance
    targets; and

•

manage our capital structure to ensure predictability of
    earnings and dividends.



    Accomplishments

•

We closed on a two-year unsecured term loan of $240 million
    of which $200 million was swapped into a fixed rate of
    3.61% and $40 million has a rate of LIBOR plus
    85 basis points. Proceeds from this loan were used to
    redeem maturing debt.

•

We closed on a $400 million credit facility which matures
    November 2018. At December 31, 2008, we had
    $224.8 million outstanding on the facility —
    $70.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 5.85% and
    $154.8 million at a variable interest rate, fixed with two-
    and three-year LIBOR swaps at an average rate of 4.32%. The
    Company has five years to draw on the additional
    $175.2 million of capacity.

•

We sold 8,661,201 shares of common stock adjusted for the
    special dividend (8,000,000 shares of common stock on an
    unadjusted basis) in a public offering, resulting in gross
    proceeds to us of $194.0 million, which were in part used
    to reduce corporate debt.

•

We completed development on two wholly-owned communities
    consisting of 644 apartment homes with an aggregate carrying
    value of $44.4 million.

•

We acquired 4,558 apartment homes in 13 communities for
    approximately $976.3 million, two parcels of land for
    $20.0 million, certain rights held by joint venture partner
    for $1.5 million and a retail property for
    $19.2 million.

•

We sold 86 communities with a total of 25,684 apartment homes
    for gross consideration of $1.7 billion.

UDR’s
    Strategies and Vision

UDR previously announced its vision to be the innovative
    multifamily public real estate investment of choice. We
    identified the following strategies to guide decision-making and
    accelerated growth:

1. Strengthen our portfolio

2. Continually improve operations

3. Maintain access to low-cost capital

Strengthen
    our Portfolio

UDR is focused on increasing its presence in markets with
    favorable job formation, low housing affordability, and a
    favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. Portfolio
    decisions consider third-party research, taking into account job
    growth, multifamily permitting and housing affordability.

In 2008, UDR sold a portfolio of properties in 86 communities
    for total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. This
    portfolio sale dramatically accelerated our transformation to
    focus on markets that have the best growth prospects based on
    favorable job formation and low single-family home
    affordability. At December 31, 2008, approximately 56.6% of
    the Company’s same store net operating income was provided
    by our communities located in California, Washington, Oregon and
    Metropolitan Washington, D.C.

Acquisitions

During 2008, in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our
    portfolio, UDR acquired 13 communities with 4,558 apartment
    homes at a total cost of approximately $976.3 million,
    including the assumption of secured debt. In addition, we
    purchased two parcels of land for $20.0 million, acquired
    certain rights held by a joint venture partner for
    $1.5 million in a consolidated operating joint venture and
    acquired a retail property for $19.2 million. UDR targets
    apartment community acquisitions in markets where job growth
    expectations are above the national average, home affordability
    is low, and the demand/supply ratio for multi-family housing is
    favorable.



When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•

population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall
    potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
    environment of the community in which the property is located;

•

geographic location, including proximity to our existing
    communities which can deliver significant economies of scale;

•

construction quality, condition and design of the community;

•

current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability
    to increase cash flow;

•

potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•

ability to increase the value and profitability of the property
    through upgrades and repositioning;

•

terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent
    increases;

•

occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar
    type in the vicinity;

•

prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing
    of the property; and

•

competition from existing multifamily communities and the
    potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in
    the area.

    our year-end ownership position for the past five years

Dispositions

We regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase the
    quality and performance of our portfolio. During 2008, as a
    major step in our portfolio repositioning, we sold 25,684 of our
    slower growing, non-core apartment homes while exiting some
    markets, specifically Arkansas, Delaware, Ohio, and South
    Carolina in an effort to increase the quality and performance of
    our portfolio. Proceeds from the disposition program were used
    primarily to reduce debt and fund acquisitions.

Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property
    include:

•

current market price for an asset compared to projected
    economics for that asset;

•

potential increases in new construction in the market area;

•

areas where the economy is not expected to grow
    substantially; and

•

markets where we do not intend to establish long-term
    concentration.

Redevelopment
    Activities

During 2008, we continued to reposition properties in targeted
    markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add
    value. Major renovations totaled $51.8 million or $1,123
    per average stabilized home for the year ended December 31,
    2008.

Joint
    Venture Activities

During 2008, we completed the development of an apartment
    community located in Marina del Rey, CA with 298 apartment homes
    and a carrying value of $139.3 million. The apartment
    community is currently in

lease-up.

In
    December 2008, we acquired our joint venture partner’s
    interest in their profit participation and terminated the
    property management agreement that had approximately two years
    remaining on the pre-existing contract.

The Company has the following unconsolidated joint venture
    project under development as of December 31, 2008 (based on
    UDR’s 49% ownership interest):

The Company is also a partner in a joint venture to develop
    another site in Bellevue, Washington. Upon formation of the
    joint venture, we owned 49% of the entity that proposes to
    develop a 430 home high-rise apartment building with ground
    floor retail space. The project is ongoing and will commence
    construction once favorable financing has been obtained.

UDR through unconsolidated joint ventures owns 4,862 apartment
    homes (with ownership percentages ranging from 20% to 49%) of
    which 4,158 are operating and 704 are under development. Our
    total equity investment at December 31, 2008 was
    $47.0 million. For additional information, see Note 4
    “Joint Ventures” of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in this Report.



Continually
    Improve Operations

UDR is committed to improving operations through automation and
    enhancing the customer’s experience. Since adopting our new
    corporate strategies, UDR has out-sourced a call center and
    created MyUDR, our resident services portal on our website. UDR
    customers have access to conduct business with us 24 hours
    a day, 7 days a week to pay rent on line and to submit a
    service request. Through transforming operations and engaging
    technology our residents get the convenience they want and our
    operating teams become more efficient.

In 2008, UDR continually enhanced

www.udr.com

and
    individual community websites deploying an innovative 3D
    interactive photo viewer, customized version of the apartment
    selector program, and special views or photos that feature
    specific apartment homes that commands an excellent view from
    the apartment, floor plans and availability. In addition to
    UDR.com improvements, we also launched a Quick Response 2D bar
    code program that can be used on most mobile devices. An
    industry first iPhone apartment search website was launched, and
    we established a social media website presence in MySpace.com.
    These enhancements have increased overall web visitor traffic to
    over 1.4 million visitors and more than 1.0 million
    organic search engine visitors which contributed to a 15%
    year-over-year lead stream increase.

Previously, UDR launched a new

Spanish-language

site, marketing to Latinos, the nation’s fastest-growing
    ethnic group. The site offers over 4,000 Spanish translated web
    pages and includes apartments for rent search resources. The
    website can be found at

http://es.udr.com

and can also be found on any web-enabled mobile device.

Maintaining
    Access to Low-Cost Capital

We seek to maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek,
    and not just react to, opportunities available in the
    marketplace. We have structured our borrowings to layer our debt
    maturities and to be able to access both secured and unsecured
    debt.

Special
    Dividend

On November 5, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend on a pre-adjusted basis of $1.29 per share
    (approximately $176.0 million or $1.19 per share on an
    adjusted basis) payable to holders of our common stock
    (“the Special Dividend”). The Special Dividend was
    paid on January 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on
    December 9, 2008. The dividend represented the
    Company’s fourth quarter recurring pre-adjusted
    distribution of $0.33 per share ($0.305 per share on an adjusted
    basis) and an additional special distribution in the
    pre-adjusted amount of $0.96 per share ($0.89 per share on an
    adjusted basis) due to taxable income arising from our
    dispositions occurring during the year. Subject to the
    Company’s right to pay the entire Special Dividend in cash,
    stockholders had the option to make an election to receive
    payment in cash or in shares, however, the aggregate amount of
    cash payable to stockholders, other than cash payable in lieu of
    fractional shares, would not be less than $44.0 million.

The Special Dividend, totaling $177.1 million was paid on
    137,266,557 pre-adjusted shares issued and outstanding on the
    record date. Approximately $133.1 million of the Special
    Dividend was paid through the issuance of 11,358,042 shares
    of common stock, which was determined based on the volume
    weighted average closing sales price of our common stock of
    $11.71 per share on the NYSE on January 21, 2009 and
    January 22, 2009. The effect of the issuance of additional
    shares of common stock pursuant to the Special Dividend was
    retroactively reflected in each of the historical periods
    presented within this Report as if those shares were issued and
    outstanding at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
    Accordingly, all activity including share issuances, repurchases
    and forfeitures have been adjusted to reflect the 8.27% increase
    in the number of shares, except where otherwise noted.



Financing
    Activities

As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we
    utilized proceeds from dispositions, debt and equity offerings
    and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt,
    and acquire apartment communities. The following is a summary of
    our major financing activities in 2008:

•

Closed on a $240 million, two-year unsecured term loan
    facility of which $200 million was swapped into a fixed
    rate of 3.61% and $40 million has a rate of LIBOR plus
    85 basis points. Proceeds were used to redeem
    $200 million of our 4.5% medium term notes due in March
    2008 with the remaining $40 million used for general
    corporate purposes.

•

Closed on a $400 million credit facility which matures
    November 2018. At December 31, 2008, we had
    $224.8 million outstanding on the facility -
    $70.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 5.85% and
    $154.8 million at a variable interest rate, fixed with two-
    and three-year LIBOR swaps at an average rate of 4.32%. The
    Company has five years to draw on the additional
    $175.2 million of capacity.

•

Sold 8,661,201 shares of our common stock adjusted for the
    Special Dividend (8,000,000 shares of common stock on an
    unadjusted basis) in a public offering, resulting in gross
    proceeds to us of $194.0 million.

•

Obtained five construction loans for a total of
    $179.3 million of which the Company has drawn
    $53.9 million for our development projects. The
    construction loans all have a two- to three-year initial term
    with extension provisions ranging from one to two years and
    incur interest at variable rates which range from LIBOR plus
    140 basis points to LIBOR plus 225 basis points.

•

Repaid $216.4 million of secured debt and
    $793.0 million of unsecured debt (represents the notional
    amount of debt repaid and excludes the gain on extinguishment).
    The $793.0 million of unsecured debt consisted of
    $309.5 million for the revolving credit facility,
    $275.8 million for maturing debt instruments and
    $207.7 million for the repurchase of unsecured debt
    instruments.

•

Repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $207.7 million for $176.2 million resulting in a gain
    on extinguishment of $29.6 million, net of deferred finance
    charges. The debt retired by the Company matured in 2011, 2014,
    2015 and 2016.

•

Repurchased 969,300 shares of our Series G Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock for $20.3 million, less than
    their liquidation value of $24.2 million.

Markets
    and Competitive Conditions

Upon completion of our dispositions activity, approximately
    56.6% of the Company’s same store net operating income was
    generated from apartment homes located in markets of California,
    Oregon, Washington and Metropolitan Washington D.C. We believe
    that this diversification increases investment opportunity and
    decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate
    markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and
    predictability of our earnings.

Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of
    our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our
    communities do not have. Competing communities can use
    concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive
    advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer
    than our communities. The competitive position of each community
    is different depending upon many factors including sub-market
    supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors
    compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop
    new properties. These competitors include insurance companies,
    pension and investment funds, public and private real estate
    companies, investment companies and other public and private
    apartment REITs and our competitors may have greater resources,
    or lower capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete
    effectively for residents and investments. We believe our
    competitive advantages include:

•

a fully integrated organization with property management,
    development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and
    financing expertise;

•

scalable operating and support systems;



•

purchasing power;

•

geographic diversification with a presence in 23 markets across
    the country; and

•

significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us
    to be a local operating expert.

Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease
    management, improved expense control, increased resident
    retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans
    tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of
    operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in
    targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform,
    should position us for continued operational improvement in
    spite of the difficult economic environment.

Communities

At December 31, 2008, our apartment portfolio included 161
    wholly-owned communities having a total of 44,388 completed
    apartment homes and an additional 2,242 under development. The
    overall quality of our portfolio has significantly improved with
    the disposition of non-core apartment homes and our upgrade and
    rehabilitation programs. The upgrading of the portfolio provides
    several key benefits related to portfolio profitability. It
    enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract
    residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more
    likely to accept the transfer of expenses, such as water and
    sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. In addition, it
    potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment
    home, and therefore should result in increased cash flow.

Same
    Community Comparison

We believe that one pertinent qualitative measurement of the
    performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same
    store community’s net operating income (“NOI”),
    which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding
    property management and other operating expenses. Our same store
    population are operating communities which we own and have
    stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning
    of the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
    our same store NOI increased by $10.8 million or 3.8%
    compared to the prior year. The increase in NOI for the 32,124
    apartment homes which make up the same store population was
    driven by an increase in revenues and physical occupancy at our
    communities.

Revenue growth in 2009 may be impacted by general adverse
    conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates,
    increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other
    factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.

Tax
    Matters

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To
    continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain
    tests that, among other things, generally require that our
    assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be
    derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we
    distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than
    net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we
    maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be
    subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level
    on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed
    to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as
    a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state
    and local taxes on our income and property.

We may utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries to engage in activities
    that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the
    provision of management and other services to third parties and
    the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions.
    Taxable REIT subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular
    corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and
    local income taxes.



Inflation

Substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or
    less, which may enable us to realize increased rents upon
    renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Such
    short-term leases generally minimize the risk to us of the
    adverse effects of inflation, although as a general rule these
    leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term
    without penalty. Short-term leases and relatively consistent
    demand allow rents to provide an attractive hedge against
    inflation.

Environmental
    Matters

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing
    operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include
    those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials
    in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and
    notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active
    underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management
    activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could
    subject us to a government enforcement action

and/or

claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental
    protection regulations has not had a material effect on our
    capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have
    a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of
    the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports
    have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition,
    all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition.
    The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental
    consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the
    purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is
    possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all
    environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental
    liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we
    have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions
    because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials
    have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the
    potential risks involved. We do not believe we will be required
    to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties.
    We believe that through professional environmental inspections
    and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous
    materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward
    accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure
    to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential
    housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential
    residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
    hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such
    notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the
    communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in
    that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint
    are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any
    such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by
    children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our
    properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a
    material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.
    We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we
    are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance,
    liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in
    connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that
    the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental
    laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us
    or our financial condition or results of operations. Future
    environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may
    require additional remediation of existing conditions that are
    not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements
    are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could
    have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our
    communities, with limits of liability customary within the
    industry to insure against liability claims and related defense
    costs. We are also insured, in all material respects, against
    the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to
    reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to
    repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income
    during the reconstruction period.

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

There are many factors that affect our business and our results
    of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The
    following is a description of important factors that may cause
    our actual results of operations in future periods to differ
    materially from those currently expected or discussed in
    forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to
    our financial results, operations and business prospects. Except
    as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any
    such forward-looking statements to reflect events or
    circumstances after the date on which it is made.

Risks
    Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Our
    Operations

Unfavorable Apartment Market and Economic Conditions Could
    Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels, Rental Revenues and the Value
    of Our Real Estate Assets.

Unfavorable market
    conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable
    economic conditions generally may significantly affect our
    occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of
    the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or
    dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable
    terms. Some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments
    and real estate taxes, generally do not decline when related
    rents decline. We would expect that declines in our occupancy
    levels, rental revenues

and/or

the
    values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less
    cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our
    stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial
    condition and the market value of our securities. Factors that
    may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues,

and/or

the
    value of our properties include the following, among others:

•

downturns in the national, regional and local economic
    conditions, particularly increases in unemployment;

•

declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing
    more affordable;

•

government or builder incentives which enable first time
    homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative
    housing options more attractive;

•

local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or
    reduced demand for, apartment homes;

•

declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may
    make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;

•

changes in market rental rates;

•

the timing and costs associated with property improvements,
    repairs or renovations;

•

declines in household formation; and

•

rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating
    rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to
    offset increases in operating costs.



We Are Subject to Certain Risks Associated with Selling
    Apartment Communities, Which Could Limit Our Operational and
    Financial Flexibility.

We have periodically
    disposed of apartment communities that no longer meet our
    strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it
    difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own,
    and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to
    us. These conditions may limit our ability to dispose of
    properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet
    our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a materially
    adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value
    of our securities. We are also subject to the following risks in
    connection with sales of our apartment communities:

•

a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property
    sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to
    qualify as like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the
    Internal Revenue Code, so that any related capital gain can be
    deferred for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may
    not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from
    our property sales;

•

federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of
    communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and
    this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when
    market conditions are favorable; further

•

in March 2008, we sold a portfolio of properties for total
    consideration of approximately $1.7 billion, including a
    note receivable in the amount of $200 million. The note is
    secured by a pledge, security agreement and a guarantee by the
    buyer’s parent entity. If we fail to receive payment on
    this note, or if the payment of the note is delayed, it could
    have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

We May Not Have Access to Proceeds Obtained From the Sale of
    Apartment Communities

.  A significant portion of
    the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by
    intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind
    exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code, so that any
    related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax
    purposes. As a result, we may not have immediate access to all
    of the cash flow generated from our property sales. In addition,
    federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of
    communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and
    this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when
    market conditions are favorable.

Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease Apartment Homes
    or Increase or Maintain Rents.

Our apartment
    communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in
    attracting residents, including other apartment communities,
    condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner
    occupied single- and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in
    a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease
    apartment homes and increase or maintain rents.

We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of Past or Future
    Acquisitions, and the Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities
    and New Personnel Successfully Could Create
    Inefficiencies.

We have selectively acquired in
    the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we
    intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment
    communities that meet our investment criteria. Our acquisition
    activities and their success are subject to the following risks:

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on
    favorable terms or at all;

•

even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment
    community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after
    incurring certain acquisition-related costs;

•

an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we
    expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure
    related to the acquired property may go undetected during our
    due diligence procedures;

•

when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional
    amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability,
    and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated
    improvements in profitability; and

•

we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired
    apartment communities and new personnel into our existing
    operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such
    apartment



communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that
    could adversely affect our expected return on our investments
    and our overall profitability.

We do not expect to acquire apartment communities at the rate we
    have in prior years, which may limit our growth and have a
    material adverse effect on our business and the market value of
    our securities. In the past, other real estate investors,
    including insurance companies, pension and investment funds,
    developer partnerships, investment companies and other apartment
    REITs, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and
    to develop new properties, and such competition in the future
    may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive
    investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could
    adversely affect growth.

Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our
    Profitability.

In the past we have selectively
    pursued the development and construction of apartment
    communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate
    opportunities arise. Development activities have been, and in
    the future may be, conducted through wholly owned affiliated
    companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties.
    Our development and construction activities are subject to the
    following risks:

•

we may be unable to obtain construction financing for
    development activities under favorable terms, including but not
    limited to interest rates, maturity dates

and/or

loan
    to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even
    abandon potential developments;

•

we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining,
    necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other
    required governmental permits and authorizations, which could
    result in increased development costs, could delay initial
    occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community,
    and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with
    respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits
    or authorizations;

•

if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the
    development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable
    financing for the developments, our development capacity may be
    limited;

•

we may abandon development opportunities that we have already
    begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already
    incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;

•

we may be unable to complete construction and

lease-up

of
    a community on schedule, or incur development or construction
    costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable
    to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such
    costs;

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may
    fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and
    economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our
    profitability goals for that community; and

•

when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we
    developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or
    construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the
    limits of our insurance.

In some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired
    communities exceeded our original estimates. We may experience
    similar cost increases in the future. Our inability to charge
    rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any
    increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Some Potential Losses May Not Be Adequately Covered by
    Insurance.

We have a comprehensive insurance
    program covering our property and operating activities. We
    believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these
    policies are adequate and appropriate. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be
    adequately covered under our insurance program. In addition, we
    will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured
    retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess
    of applicable coverage.

If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits
    occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have
    invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future
    revenue from the property. In such an event, we might
    nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other
    financial obligations related to the property. Material losses
    in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. If one
    or more of our



significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss,
    it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and
    result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Such
    events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make
    distributions to our stockholders.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our
    Growth.

We have acquired in the past, and we may
    acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise,
    apartment communities that are outside of our existing market.
    Entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks,
    and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets.
    These risks include, among others:

•

inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market
    conditions and local economies;

•

inability to hire and retain key personnel;

•

lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting
    procedures; and

•

inability to achieve budgeted financial results.

Risk of Inflation/Deflation.

Substantial
    inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative
    effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. Although
    inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the
    recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced
    negative impact on our debt interest and general and
    administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate
    higher than our rental rates.

Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could
    Result in Substantial Costs.

Under various
    federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or
    former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to
    investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of
    currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic
    substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or
    responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our
    current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. In
    addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or
    to third parties for property damage and for investigation and

clean-up

costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs
    could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws
    create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure
    their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to
    properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially
    and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent
    an affected property.

Property Ownership Through Joint Ventures May Limit Our
    Ability to Act Exclusively in Our Interest.

We
    have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire
    properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when
    we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. If
    we use such a structure, we could become engaged in a dispute
    with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect
    our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. Moreover, joint
    venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives
    that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives
    that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or
    refinancing of a property. In some instances, joint venture
    partners may have competing interests in our markets that could
    create conflicts of interest.

Compliance or Failure to Comply with the Americans with
    Disabilities Act of 1990 or Other Safety Regulations and
    Requirements Could Result in Substantial
    Costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act
    generally requires that public buildings, including our
    properties, be made accessible to disabled persons.
    Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the
    federal government or the award of damages to private litigants.
    From time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect
    to some of our properties under this Act. If, under the
    Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make
    substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more
    of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it
    could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local
    regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life
    safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these
    requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We
    do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether
    compliance with future requirements will require significant
    unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and
    results of operations.



Real Estate Tax and Other Laws.

Generally we
    do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance
    with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property
    tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in
    income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. These
    costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability
    to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance
    with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential
    liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or
    the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or
    (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws
    regulating housing, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act
    and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, may result in
    significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely
    affect funds from operations and the ability to make
    distributions to stockholders.

Risk of Damage from Catastrophic Weather
    Events.

Certain of our communities are located in
    the general vicinity of active earthquake faults, mudslides and
    fires, and others where there are hurricanes, tornadoes or risks
    of other inclement weather. The adverse weather events could
    cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels.
    In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could
    lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as
    anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also
    continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or
    other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could
    materially and adversely affect our business and our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Actual or Threatened Terrorist Attacks May Have an Adverse
    Effect on Our Business and Operating Results and Could Decrease
    the Value of Our Assets.

Actual or threatened
    terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
    Attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment
    communities could significantly affect our ability to operate
    those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our
    expected results. Further, our insurance coverage may not cover
    all losses caused by a terrorist attack. In addition, the
    adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future
    attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have
    a material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

Any Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Stock
    Price.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal
    control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more
    material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
    reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and
    completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have
    an adverse effect on our stock price.

Our Success Depends on Our Senior
    Management.

Our success depends upon the
    retention of our senior management, whose continued service in
    not guaranteed. We may not be able to find qualified
    replacements for the individuals who make up our senior
    management if their services should no longer be available to
    us. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior
    management team could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and
    Create Refinancing Risk.

We are subject to the
    risks normally associated with debt financing, including the
    risk that our operating income and cash flow will be
    insufficient to make required payments of principal and
    interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our
    line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash
    flow may not be available to make all required principal
    payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to
    maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available
    to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints
    of our debt covenants. Additionally, we are likely to need to
    refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it
    matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the
    terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of
    the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets
    or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose
    to do so. In addition, our failure to comply with our debt
    covenants could result in a requirement to repay our
    indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse
    effect on our cash flow and increase our financing costs.



Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt
    Service Payments and Distributions to
    Stockholders.

If our apartment communities do not
    generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses,
    our ability to make required payments of interest and principal
    on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our
    stockholders will be adversely affected. The following factors,
    among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our
    apartment communities:

•

the national and local economies;

•

local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of
    apartment homes;

•

tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience, and
    attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where
    they are located;

•

our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and
    insurance;

•

rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities;

•

changes in interest rates and the availability of
    financing; and

•

changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent
    control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing.

Expenses associated with our investment in an apartment
    community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance
    and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when
    circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that
    community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt
    and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could
    sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or
    the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.

Debt Level May Be Increased.

Our current
    debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of
    debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is
    limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We
    manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants,
    but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase
    the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent
    improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.

Financing May Not Be Available and Could Be
    Dilutive.

Our ability to execute our business
    strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt
    financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms
    of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including
    common and preferred equity. We and other companies in the real
    estate industry have experienced limited availability of
    financing from time to time. If we issue additional equity
    securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of
    incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could
    be diluted.

Financing Could be Impacted by Negative Capital Market
    Conditions.

Recently, domestic financial markets
    have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty. While this
    condition has occurred most visibly within the
    “subprime” mortgage lending sector of the credit
    market, liquidity has tightened in overall domestic financial
    markets, including the investment grade debt and equity capital
    markets. Consequently, there is greater risk that the financial
    institutions we do business with could experience disruptions
    that would negatively affect our ability to obtain financing.

Disruptions in Financial Markets May Adversely Impact
    Availability and Cost of Credit, Impact Our Tenant Base, and
    Have other Adverse Effects on Us and the Market Price of Our
    Stock.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or
    to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and
    financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing
    economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors
    beyond our control. The United States stock and credit markets
    have recently experienced significant price volatility,
    dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market
    prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads
    on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These
    circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the
    financial markets, making terms for certain financings less
    attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the
    unavailability of financing. Continued uncertainty in the stock
    and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access
    additional financing for acquisitions, development of our
    properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may
    negatively affect our business. Additionally, due



to this uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing
    indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as
    favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. If we are
    not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due, we
    may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms,
    which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt
    and to meet our other obligations. A prolonged downturn in the
    financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of
    potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to
    adjust our business plan accordingly. These events also may make
    it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the
    issuance of our common or preferred stock. The disruptions in
    the financial markets have had and may continue to have a
    material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares
    and other adverse effects on us and our business.

Prospective buyers of our properties may also experience
    difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more
    difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing
    levels. Current tightening of credit in financial markets and
    increasing unemployment may also adversely affect the ability of
    tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue
    increasing rents on a prospective basis. Disruptions in the
    credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects
    on us and the overall economy.

The Soundness of Financial Institutions Could Adversely
    Affect Us.

We have relationships with many
    financial institutions, including lenders under our credit
    facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with
    counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result,
    defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial
    institutions or the financial services industry generally, could
    result in losses or defaults by these institutions. In the event
    that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects
    these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other
    parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete
    transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our
    business and results of operations.

Changing Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and
    Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow and the Market Price of Our
    Securities.

We currently have, and expect to
    incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary
    with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, we had
    approximately $345.7 million of variable rate indebtedness
    outstanding, which constitutes approximately 10.5% of our total
    outstanding indebtedness as of such date. An increase in
    interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase
    the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing
    new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely
    affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make
    distributions to security holders. The effect of prolonged
    interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to
    make acquisitions and develop properties. In addition, an
    increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders
    to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect
    the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt
    securities.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May
    Result in Material Charges.

From time to time
    when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit
    our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period
    prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest
    rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the
    predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time
    we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our
    exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in
    market interest rates. If the terms of new debt securities are
    not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall
    below that which we incur under a particular interest rate
    hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore, the
    settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and
    may in the future involve material charges.

Risks
    Related to Tax Laws

We Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if We Fail to Qualify
    as a REIT.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT
    under the Internal Revenue Code. Our qualification as a REIT
    requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual
    and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and
    complex Code provisions for which there are only limited
    judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the
    determination of various factual matters and circumstances not
    entirely within our control. We intend that our current
    organization and method of operation enable us to continue to
    qualify as a REIT, but we may not so qualify or we may not be
    able to remain so qualified in the future. In addition,
    U.S. federal income tax laws



governing REITs and other corporations and the administrative
    interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time,
    potentially with retroactive effect. Future legislation, new
    regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions
    could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or
    adversely affect our stockholders.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be
    subject to federal income tax (including any applicable
    alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular
    corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends
    paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. Also,
    unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under
    certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from
    treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
    year in which we first failed to qualify. The additional tax
    liability from the failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce or
    eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or
    distribution to our stockholders. This would likely have a
    significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and
    our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we would
    no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.
    Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be
    subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income
    and property.

REITs May Pay a Portion of Dividends in Common
    Stock.

In December 2008, the Internal Revenue
    Service issued Revenue Procedure

2008-68,

providing temporary guidance that assists publicly traded REITs
    in satisfying their tax-related distribution requirements while
    conserving cash. This temporary guidance is intended to permit
    REITs to limit cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity
    during the current downturn in economic conditions. Under this
    guidance, effective January 1, 2008 and ending on or before
    December 31, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service will treat
    a distribution of stock by a publicly traded REIT, pursuant to
    certain elections to receive stock or cash, as a taxable
    distribution of property. The amount of such stock distribution
    will be treated as equal to the amount of cash that could have
    been received instead. The guidance permits REITs to limit the
    aggregate amount of cash available to stockholders pursuant to
    the election to 10% of the aggregate distribution of cash and
    stock taken together. If we pay a portion of our dividends in
    shares of our common stock pursuant to this temporary guidance,
    our stockholders may receive less cash than they received in
    distributions in prior years and the market value of our
    securities may decline.

We May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable REIT
    Subsidiaries, Which are Subject to Certain Tax
    Risks.

We have established several taxable REIT
    subsidiaries. Despite our qualification as a REIT, our taxable
    REIT subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income.
    In addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to
    qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and our
    income from and investments in our taxable REIT subsidiaries
    generally do not constitute permissible income and investments
    for these tests. While we will attempt to ensure that our
    dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not adversely
    affect our REIT qualification, we cannot provide assurance that
    we will successfully achieve that result. Furthermore, we may be
    subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to
    retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our
    dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be
    arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected.

REIT Distribution Requirements Limit Our Available
    Cash.

As a REIT, we are subject to annual
    distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we
    retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund
    our growth. We generally must distribute annually at least 90%
    of our net REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital
    gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to
    corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to our
    stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code.
    However, differences in timing between the recognition of
    taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us
    to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term
    basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code.

Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited
    Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain
    Attributable to the Transaction.

From time to
    time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our
    properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting
    from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or
    primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of
    business would be treated as income from a prohibited
    transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire
    properties for investment



purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or
    disposals of property are prohibited transactions. However,
    whether property is held for investment purposes is a question
    of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances
    surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue
    Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of
    properties by us are prohibited transactions. If the Internal
    Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer or
    disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction,
    then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain
    allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may
    jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property
    sales. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might
    adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for
    qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

We Could Face Possible State and Local Tax Audits and Adverse
    Changes in State and Local Tax Laws.

As discussed
    in the risk factors above, because we are organized and qualify
    as a REIT we are generally not subject to federal income taxes,
    but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. From time
    to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are
    enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A
    shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which
    we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the
    frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we
    may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. These
    increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial
    condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of
    distributions to our stockholders. In the normal course of
    business, entities through which we own real estate may also
    become subject to tax audits. If such entities become subject to
    state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits
    could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

Risks
    Related to Our Organization and Our Shares

Changes in Market Conditions and Volatility of Stock Prices
    Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common
    Stock.

The stock markets, including the New York
    Stock Exchange, on which we list our common shares, have
    experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a
    result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly
    volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a
    decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases
    unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.

Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to
    Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in Our
    Stockholders’ Best Interests.

Maryland
    business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to
    acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject
    to various Maryland laws which may have the effect of
    discouraging offers to acquire our Company and of increasing the
    difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our
    acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests.
    The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other
    business combination transactions between us and any person who
    acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock
    representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board
    of directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination
    transaction could not be completed until five years after the
    person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the
    approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled
    to be cast and


/


%
    of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested
    stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also
    provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our
    equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of
    the voting power in electing directors will have no voting
    rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares
    eligible to vote.

Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability
    of Our Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company
    May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to Our
    Stockholders.

One of the requirements for
    maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal
    income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our
    outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer
    individuals, including entities specified in the Internal
    Revenue Code, during the last half of any taxable year. Our
    charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to
    our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and
    other REIT ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may
    have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does
    not threaten REIT status. These restrictions include a provision
    that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9%
    of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board
    of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation,
    provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to
    exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. These
    provisions may have the effect of



delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of
    us, even though a change of control might involve a premium
    price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our
    stockholders’ best interests.

(a)

Distributions declared per share have been retroactively
    adjusted for the effect of the Special Dividend, which increased
    the number of shares outstanding by 8.27%.

We declared a Special Dividend on our common stock on
    November 5, 2008 of $0.96 per share on an unadjusted basis
    ($0.89 per share adjusted for the Special Dividend) in addition
    to our quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share ($0.305 per share
    adjusted for the Special Dividend), which represented an
    aggregate dividend of approximately $1.29 per share ($1.19 per
    share adjusted for the Special Dividend) or $177.1 million.
    The aggregate amount of cash that the Company paid to
    stockholders related to the fourth quarter distribution was
    $44.0 million. In connection with the Special Dividend the
    Company issued 11,358,042 million shares of our common
    stock to our stockholders.

On February 13, 2009, the closing sale price of our common
    stock was $9.40 per share on the NYSE and there were 5,268
    holders of record of the 148,816,685 outstanding shares of our
    common stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax purposes,
    approximately 8% of the distributions for 2008 represented
    ordinary income, 69% represented long-term capital gain, and 23%
    represented unrecaptured section 1250 gain.

We pay regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common
    stock. Future distributions will be at the discretion of our
    Board of Directors and will depend on our actual funds from
    operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the
    annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of
    the Internal Revenue Code, and other factors. The annual
    distribution payment for calendar year 2008 necessary for us to
    maintain our status as a REIT was approximately $0.19 per share
    of common stock adjusted for the Special Dividend. We declared
    total distributions of $2.28 per share of common stock ($2.11
    per share adjusted for the Special Dividend) for 2008. For
    distributions made with respect to taxable years ending on or
    before December 31, 2009, the IRS will allow REITs to
    reduce the minimum cash distribution to 10% of the total
    required distribution.

Series E
    Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
    (“Series E”) has no stated par value and a
    liquidation preference of $16.61 per share. Subject to certain
    adjustments and conditions, each share of the Series E is
    convertible at any time and from time to time at the
    holder’s option into one share of our common stock. The
    holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on an
    as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the
    holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for
    the election of directors or for any



other purpose on which the holders of common stock are entitled
    to vote. The Series E has no stated maturity and is not
    subject to any sinking fund or any mandatory redemption. In
    connection with the Special Dividend, the Company reserved for
    issuance upon conversion of the Series E additional shares
    of common stock to which a holder of the Series E would
    have received if the holder had converted the Series E
    immediately prior to the record date for the Special Dividend.

Distributions declared on the Series E in 2008 were $1.33
    per share or $0.3322 per quarter. The Series E is not
    listed on any exchange. At December 31, 2008, a total of
    2,803,812 shares of the Series E were outstanding,
    which is 3,035,548 if converted to common stock after adjustment
    for the Special Dividend.

Series F
    Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of our
    Series F Preferred Stock (“Series F”). Our
    Series F Preferred Stock may be purchased by holders of our
    operating partnership units, or OP Units, described below
    under “Operating Partnership Units,” at a purchase
    price of $0.0001 per share. OP Unitholders are entitled to
    subscribe for and purchase one share of our Series F
    Preferred Stock for each OP Unit held. At December 31,
    2008, a total of 666,293 shares of the Series F
    Preferred Stock were outstanding at a value of $67. Holders of
    the Series F Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for
    each share of the Series F Preferred Stock they hold,
    voting together with the holders of our common stock, on each
    matter submitted to a vote of securityholders at a meeting of
    our stockholders. The Series F Preferred Stock does not
    entitle its holders to any other rights, privileges or
    preferences.

Dividend
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under
    which holders of our common stock may elect to automatically
    reinvest their distributions and make additional cash payments
    to acquire additional shares of our common stock. Stockholders
    who do not participate in the plan continue to receive dividends
    as declared. As of February 13, 2009, there were
    approximately 3,000 participants in the plan.

Operating
    Partnership Units

From time to time we issue shares of our common stock in
    exchange for operating partnership units
    (“OP Units”) tendered to our operating
    partnerships, United Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage
    Communities L.P., for redemption in accordance with the
    provisions of their respective partnership agreements. At
    December 31, 2008 after taking into account the impact of
    the Special Dividend there were 7,929,169 OP Units and
    185,816 OP Units in United Dominion Realty, L.P. and
    Heritage Communities L.P., (7,323,853 OP Units and 171,629
    OP Units in United Dominion realty, L.P. and Heritage
    Communities L.P. on an unadjusted basis) respectively, that were
    owned by limited partners. The holder of the OP Units has
    the right to require United Dominion Realty, L.P. to redeem
    all or a portion of the OP Units held by the holder in
    exchange for a cash payment based on the market value of our
    common stock at the time of redemption. However, United Dominion
    Realty, L.P.’s obligation to pay the cash amount is subject
    to the prior right of the Company to acquire such OP Units
    in exchange for either the cash amount or shares of our common
    stock. Heritage Communities L.P. OP Units are convertible
    into common stock in lieu of cash, at our option, once the
    holder elects to convert, at an exchange ratio of
    1.575 shares for each OP Unit. During 2008, after
    adjustment for the Special Dividend we issued a total of
    1,596,402 shares of common stock (1,474,531 shares of
    common stock on an unadjusted basis) upon redemption of
    OP Units.

Purchases
    of Equity Securities

In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a
    10.0 million share repurchase program and in January 2008,
    our Board of Directors authorized an additional
    15.0 million share repurchase program. These programs
    authorize the repurchase of our common stock in open market
    purchases, in block purchases, privately negotiated
    transactions, or otherwise. The number of shares authorized for
    repurchase was not impacted by the Special Dividend. As
    reflected in the table below, the Company did not repurchase any
    shares of common stock under these programs during the quarter
    ended December 31, 2008.



The following tables set forth certain information regarding our
    common stock repurchases during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2008.

Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities

As an inducement grant in connection with our hiring of Warren
    L. Troupe, our Senior Executive Vice President, we issued
    176,211 shares of our restricted common stock to
    Mr. Troupe on March 3, 2008 in a transaction exempt
    from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933
    in a reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
    Subject to Mr. Troupe’s continued employment by UDR,
    the shares of restricted stock will vest pro rata over four
    years from the date of grant. Information regarding the issuance
    of these shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Troupe is
    set forth in our Current Report on

Form 8-K

    comparable cumulative return of the NAREIT Equity REIT Index,
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index, the NAREIT
    Equity Apartment Index and the MSCI US REIT Index. Each graph
    assumes that $100 was invested on December 31 (of the
    initial year shown in the graph), in each of our common stock
    and the indices presented. Historical stock price performance is
    not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

Business
    Overview

We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns,
    acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities
    nationwide. We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In
    June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia
    to Maryland. Our subsidiaries include two operating
    partnerships, Heritage Communities L.P., a Delaware limited
    partnership, and United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware
    limited partnership. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
    references in this Report to “we,” “us,”
    “our,” “the Company,” or “UDR”
    refer collectively to UDR, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2008, our wholly-owned real estate
    portfolio included 161 communities with 44,388 apartment homes
    and our total real estate portfolio, inclusive of our
    unconsolidated communities, included an additional 11
    communities with 4,158 apartment homes.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial
    obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale or
    maturity of existing assets, or by the acquisition of additional
    funds through capital management. Both the coordination of asset
    and liability maturities and effective capital management are
    important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of
    liquidity is our cash flow from operations as



determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating
    expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes. We
    routinely use our unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily
    fund certain operating, investing, financing and other
    activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing. During
    the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate
    have been used for debt repayment, investing and financing
    activities.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements
    generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings
    under credit arrangements. We expect to meet certain long-term
    liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the
    repayment of financing on development properties, and potential
    property acquisitions, through long-term secured and unsecured
    borrowings, the disposition of properties, and the issuance of
    additional debt or equity securities. Dividends and budgeted
    expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain
    properties are expected to be funded from cash provided by our
    unsecured revolving credit facility, other debt and equity
    issuances and cash flows provided by property operations.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission which provides for the issuance of an
    indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt
    securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants,
    subscription rights, purchase contracts and units to facilitate
    future financing activities in the public capital markets.
    Access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at
    the time of the financing activity.

Future
    Capital Needs

Future development expenditures are expected to be funded with
    proceeds from construction loans, the sale of property, our
    unsecured revolving credit facility, and to a lesser extent,
    with cash flows provided by operating activities. Acquisition
    activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed
    through the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of
    properties, the issuance of equity and debt securities, the
    issuance of operating partnership units, the assumption or
    placement of secured

and/or

unsecured debt.

During 2009, we have approximately $146.1 million of
    secured debt and $250.1 million of unsecured debt maturing
    and we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from
    borrowings under our secured or unsecured credit facilities,
    proceeds from our note receivable, the issuance of new unsecured
    debt securities or equity or from disposition proceeds. We also
    anticipate using contractually provided extensions for secured
    debt.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to use judgment in the application of
    accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.
    A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to
    our financial condition and results of operations as well as
    involves some degree of uncertainty. Estimates are prepared
    based on management’s assessment after considering all
    evidence available. Changes in estimates could affect our
    financial position or results of operations. Below is a
    discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical
    to understanding our financial condition or results of
    operations where there is uncertainty or requires significant
    judgment.

Capital
    Expenditures

In conformity with GAAP, we capitalize those expenditures
    related to acquiring new assets, materially enhancing the value
    of an existing asset, or substantially extending the useful life
    of an existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an
    existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed
    as incurred.

During 2008, $131.0 million or $2,838 per home was spent on
    capital expenditures for all of our communities, excluding
    development, condominium conversions and commercial properties
    compared to $194.4 million or $2,829 per home spent in
    2007. These capital improvements included turnover related
    expenditures for floor coverings and appliances, other recurring
    capital expenditures such as roofs, siding, parking lots, and
    asset preservation capital expenditures, which aggregated
    $29.1 million or $630 per home. In addition, revenue
    enhancing capital expenditures, kitchen and bath upgrades,
    upgrades to HVAC equipment,



and other extensive exterior/interior upgrades totaled
    $50.1 million or $1,085 per home, and major renovations
    totaled $51.8 million or $1,123 per home for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

The following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and
    maintenance costs for all of our communities, excluding real
    estate under development, condominium conversions and commercial
    properties, for the periods presented:

    Recurring capital expenditures during 2009 are currently
    expected to be approximately $675 per home.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
    operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
    assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
    estimated to be generated by the future operation and
    disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of
    those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical
    results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market
    and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The
    net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market
    value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best
    estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market
    rates and transactions.

Real
    Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time
    and allocate the purchase price to various components, such as
    land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases in
    accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, “Business
    Combinations.” The purchase price is allocated based on the
    relative fair value of each component. The fair value of
    buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon
    acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As
    such, the determination of fair value considers the present
    value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the
    property including an initial

lease-up

period. We determine the fair value of in-place leases by
    assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease
    relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In
    addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the
    foregone rents associated with the

lease-up

period, and the carrying costs associated with the

lease-up

period. The fair value of in-place leases is recorded and
    amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual
    lease period.

REIT
    Status

We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for
    federal income tax purposes as a REIT. A REIT is a legal entity
    that holds interests in real estate and is required by the Code
    to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements,
    including a requirement that a REIT must distribute at least 90%
    of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to
    our stockholders. If we were to fail to qualify



as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and
    state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be
    able to qualify as a REIT for four years. Based on the net
    earnings reported for the year ended December 31, 2008 in
    our Consolidated Statements of Operations we would have incurred
    $284.8 million in federal and state GAAP income taxes if we
    had failed to qualify as a REIT.

Statements
    of Cash Flow

The following discussion explains the changes in net cash
    provided by operating activities and net cash provided by/(used
    in) investing and financing activities that are presented in our
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Operating
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2008, our net cash flow
    provided by operating activities was $179.8 million
    compared to $269.3 million for 2007. During 2008, the
    decrease in cash flow from operating activities resulted
    primarily from a reduction in property operating income from our
    apartment community portfolio. The reduction was driven by the
    Company completing the sale of a significant component of our
    portfolio in the first quarter of 2008. A portion of the
    proceeds from the disposition were reinvested in subsequent
    quarters which diluted the net cash provided by operations for
    the period in which the Company held restricted 1031 cash funds
    in lieu of revenue generating operating communities.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, our net cash flow
    provided by operating activities was $269.3 million
    compared to $237.9 million for 2006. During 2007, the
    increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted
    primarily from the increase in property operating income from
    the Company’s portfolio performing well on a same community
    basis for revenues and NOI.

Investing
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash provided by
    investing activities was $302.3 million compared to net
    cash used of $90.1 million for 2007. Changes in the level
    of investing activities from period to period reflects our
    strategy as it relates to acquisitions, capital expenditures,
    development and disposition activities, as well as the impact of
    the capital market environment on these activities, all of which
    are discussed in further detail throughout this Report.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash used in
    investing activities was $90.1 million compared to
    $158.2 million for 2006. Changes in the level of investing
    activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it
    relates to our acquisition, capital expenditure, development,
    and disposition programs, as well as the impact of the capital
    market environment on these activities.

Acquisitions

For the year ended December 31, 2008, we acquired 13
    apartment communities with 4,558 apartment homes, two parcels of
    land, and one retail property for aggregate consideration of
    $1.0 billion. Our long-term strategic plan is to achieve
    greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more
    concentrated markets. As a result, we have been expanding our
    interests in communities located in California, Florida,
    Metropolitan Washington D.C. and the Washington markets over the
    past years. Prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new
    investments into those markets we believe will provide the best
    investment returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined
    criteria including favorable job formation and low housing
    affordability.

(c)

This community was acquired by the
    Company while under development and is projected to be completed
    in the first quarter of 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, we acquired 13
    apartment communities with 2,671 apartment homes, six parcels of
    land, and an interest in an operating joint venture for an
    aggregate consideration of $486.5 million. In 2006, we
    acquired eight apartment communities with 2,763 apartment homes
    for an aggregate consideration of $327.5 million and two
    parcels of land for $19.9 million.

Real
    Estate Under Development

At December 31, 2008, our development pipeline for
    wholly-owned communities totaled 2,407 homes with a budget of
    $375.9 million in which we have a carrying value of
    $186.8 million. We expect to have the first of the
    communities complete development during 2009. In addition, we
    own several parcels of land held for future development in which
    the Company is seeking entitlements and preparing for
    development, although we do not anticipate development to
    commence during 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, we invested
    approximately $160.1 million in development projects, an
    increase of $58.6 million from our 2007 level of
    $101.5 million. As a result of our investment in
    developments, we completed development on two wholly-owned
    communities with 644 apartment homes that have a carrying value
    of $44.4 million and acquired three pre-sale communities
    with 820 apartment homes that have a carrying value of
    $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Consolidated
    Development Joint Venture

In 2006, we entered into a joint venture to develop an apartment
    community with 298 apartment homes in Marina del Rey,
    California. Our initial investment was $27.5 million. Our
    joint venture partner was the managing partner as well as the
    developer, general contractor and property manager. In December
    2008, we acquired for $1.5 million our joint venture
    partner’s interest in their profit participation and
    terminated the property management agreement that had
    approximately two years remaining on the pre-existing contract.
    As a result of terminating our arrangement, the Company recorded
    a charge to earnings of $305,000 as the profit component related
    to the management agreement and capitalized the balance as part
    of the investment in real estate, which will be depreciated over
    the average remaining life of the tangible asset. As of
    December 31, 2008, this property is included as a component
    of our wholly-owned communities.



Unconsolidated
    Joint Ventures

UDR is a partner in a joint venture to develop a site in
    Bellevue, Washington. At closing, we owned 49% of the project
    that involves building a 430 home high rise apartment building
    with ground floor retail. The project is currently ongoing and
    will commence construction once market conditions improve and
    favorable financing has been obtained. Our investment at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $10.2 million and
    $8.1 million, respectively.

UDR is a partner in a joint venture which will develop 274
    apartment homes in the central business district of Bellevue,
    Washington. Construction began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and
    is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2009. At
    closing, we owned 49% of the project. Our investment at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $9.9 million and
    $8.9 million, respectively.

In January 2007, we entered into a joint venture which owns and
    operates a recently completed 23-story, 166 apartment home high
    rise community in the central business district of Bellevue,
    Washington. At closing, UDR owned 49% of the project. Our
    investment at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was
    $10.4 million and $11.2 million, respectively.

In November 2007, UDR and an institutional unaffiliated partner
    formed a joint venture which owns and operates various apartment
    communities located in Texas. On the closing date, UDR sold nine
    operating properties, consisting of 3,690 units, and
    contributed one property under development to the joint venture.
    The property under development has 302 units and was
    completed in the third quarter of 2008 and commenced lease up at
    that time. UDR contributed cash and property equal to 20% of the
    fair value of the properties. The unaffiliated partner
    contributed cash equal to 80% of the fair value of the
    properties comprising the venture, which was then used to
    purchase the nine operating properties from UDR. Our investment
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $16.5 million and
    $20.1 million, respectively. In addition, during 2008 we
    received payment in full of a note receivable of
    $18.8 million from the joint venture.

Disposition
    of Investments

During the year ended December 31, 2008, UDR sold 86
    communities with a total of 25,684 apartment homes, for gross
    consideration of $1.7 billion, 53 condominiums from two
    communities with a total of 640 condominiums for gross
    consideration of $6.9 million, one parcel of land for gross
    proceeds of $1.6 million and one commercial property for
    gross proceeds of $6.5 million. We recognized after-tax
    gains for financial reporting purposes of $786.4 million on
    these sales. Proceeds from the sales were used primarily to
    acquire new communities and reduce debt. During 2008, we decided
    to discontinue sales of units with the two communities
    identified for condominium conversion until such time that the
    market conditions turn favorable and it is economically
    beneficial to sell those units versus operate the residual
    525 units of those communities. As a result of our decision
    to revert the remaining units to operations the Company recorded
    a charge to earnings of $1.7 million, excluding the catch
    up for depreciation on the units when they were returned to
    operations.

As a result of our disposition activities in 2008, the Company
    declared a Special Dividend payable to holders of our common
    stock for $0.96 per share included with our recurring
    distribution for the Company’s fourth quarter of 2008 for a
    total of $1.29 per share ($1.19 per share in the aggregate
    adjusted for the Special Dividend) payable on January 29,
    2009 to stockholders of record on December 9, 2008.
    Additional information regarding the Special Dividend is set
    forth in Item 1. Business in Part 1 of this Report.

In conjunction with the transaction in which we sold 86
    communities for $1.7 billion, we received a note in the
    amount of $200.0 million. The note, which is secured by a
    pledge, security agreement and a guarantee from the buyer’s
    parent entity, bears interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum and
    matures on March 31, 2014, provided however that the master
    credit facility agreement pursuant to which the buyer financed
    the acquisition of the properties provides that the buyer will
    pay or prepay the note on or before the date that is fourteen
    (14) months after the Initial Closing Date (May 3,
    2009) and further that it is an event of default under the
    master credit facility agreement if the note is not paid in full
    by June 1, 2009.



For the year ended December 31, 2007, UDR sold 21
    communities with a total of 7,125 apartment homes for gross
    consideration of $729.2 million, one parcel of land for
    $4.5 million, and contributed one property under
    development, at cost, to a joint venture arrangement in Texas.
    In addition, we sold 61 condominiums from two communities with a
    total of 640 condominiums for gross consideration of
    $10.4 million. We recognized after-tax gains for financial
    reporting purposes of $239.1 million on these sales.
    Proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt.

Financing
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2008, our net cash used in
    financing activities was $472.5 million compared to
    $178.1 million for the comparable period of 2007.

The following significant financing activity occurred during the
    year ended December 31, 2008:

•

Closed on a $240.0 million, two-year unsecured term loan
    facility of which $200 million was swapped into a fixed
    rate of 3.61% and $40.0 million has a rate of LIBOR plus
    85 basis points. Proceeds were used to redeem
    $200.0 million of our 4.5% medium term notes due in March
    2008 with the remaining $40.0 million used for general
    corporate purposes.

•

Closed on a $400 million credit facility which matures
    November 2018. At December 31, 2008, we had
    $224.8 million outstanding on the facility -
    $70.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 5.85% and
    $154.8 million at a variable interest rate, fixed with two-
    and three-year LIBOR swaps at an average rate of 4.32%. The
    Company has five years to draw on the additional
    $175.2 million of capacity. This facility replaced a debt
    instrument with an outstanding balance of $138.9 million
    that matured on April 1, 2010 that had a stated rate of
    6.09%. As a result of this refinancing the Company incurred a
    charge to earnings of $4.7 million related to the write off
    of deferred financing charges and prepayment penalties
    associated with the retired debt instrument. Some of the
    incremental proceeds from this note were used to purchase
    unsecured long term debt at a discount to par.

•

Sold 8,661,201 shares of our common stock adjusted for the
    Special Dividend (8,000,000 shares of common stock on an
    unadjusted basis) in a public offering resulting in gross
    proceeds of $194.0 million.

•

Obtained five construction loans for a total of
    $179.3 million of which the Company has drawn
    $53.9 million for our development projects. The
    construction loans all have a three-year initial terms with an
    extension provision(s) and incur interest at a variable rates
    which range from LIBOR plus 140 basis points to LIBOR plus
    225 basis points.

•

Repaid $216.4 million of secured debt and
    $793.0 million of unsecured debt (represents the notional
    amount of debt repaid and excludes the gain on extinguishment).
    The $793.0 million of unsecured debt consisted of
    $309.5 million for the revolving credit facility,
    $275.8 million for maturing debt and $207.7 million
    for the repurchase of unsecured debt.

•

Repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of
    $207.7 million for $176.2 million resulting in a gain
    on extinguishment of $29.6 million, net of deferred finance
    charges. The unsecured debt repurchased by the Company matured
    in 2011, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. As a result of these
    repurchases, the gain is presented as a reduction to interest
    expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

•

Repurchased 969,300 shares of our Series G Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock for $20.3 million, less than
    their liquidation value of $24.2 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, our net cash used in
    financing activities was $178.1 million compared to
    $93.0 million for the comparable period of 2006. The
    increase in financing activities was due to the Company repaying
    additional secured debt, the redemption of our Series B
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, repurchase of common
    stock in the marketplace which was offset by the issuance of
    issuance of debt and equity securities and drawing down on our
    unsecured credit facility.



Credit
    Facilities

As of December 31, 2008, we have secured revolving credit
    facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of
    $1.0 billion with $831.2 million outstanding. The
    Fannie Mae credit facilities are for an initial term of
    10 years, bear interest at floating and fixed rates, and
    certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an
    additional five years at our option. We have $666.6 million
    of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate
    of 5.5% and the remaining balance on these facilities is
    currently at a weighted average variable rate of 3.1%.

As of December 31, 2007, we had secured revolving credit
    facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of
    $748.9 million with $663.9 million outstanding. The
    Fannie Mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten
    years, bear interest at floating and fixed rates, and certain
    variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five
    years at our option. We had $583.1 million of the funded
    balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 5.9% and
    the remaining balance on these facilities was at a weighted
    average variable rate of 5.1%.

On July 27, 2007, we amended and restated our existing
    three-year $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility
    with a maturity date of May 31, 2008, (which could be
    extended for an additional year at our option) to increase the
    facility to $600 million and to extend its maturity to
    July 26, 2012. Under certain circumstances, we may increase
    the new $600 million credit facility to $750 million.
    Based on our current credit ratings, the $600 million
    credit facility carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a
    spread of 47.5 basis points, which represents a
    10 basis point reduction to the previous $500 million
    revolving credit facility. Under a competitive bid feature and
    for so long as we maintain an investment grade rating, we have
    the right under the new $600 million credit facility to bid
    out 50% of the commitment amount and we can bid out 100% of the
    commitment amount once per quarter. As of December 31, 2008
    and 2007, there was $0 and $309.5 million, respectively,
    outstanding on the unsecured revolving credit facility.

The Fannie Mae credit facility and the bank revolving credit
    facility are subject to customary financial covenants and
    limitations.

Interest
    Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable
    rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced.
    We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other
    speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial
    instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets.
    Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in
    market interest rates and the fair value of market rate
    sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as
    changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable
    rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. We had
    $345.7 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to
    interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2008. If
    market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by
    100 basis point, our interest expense would increase by
    $3.8 million based on the average balance outstanding
    during the year.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of
    hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These
    analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of
    overall economic activity that could exist in such an
    environment. Further, in the event of a change of such
    magnitude, management would likely take actions to further
    mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the
    uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and
    their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no
    change in our financial structure.

Funds
    from Operations

Funds from operations, or FFO, is defined as net income
    (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses)
    from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate
    depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute FFO
    for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations
    set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment
    Trust’s (“NAREIT”) April 1, 2002 White
    Paper. We consider FFO in evaluating property



acquisitions and our operating performance, and believe that FFO
    should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to,
    net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. FFO
    does not represent cash generated from operating activities in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is
    not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance
    with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate
    assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate
    values instead have historically risen or fallen with market
    conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered
    the presentation of operating results for real estate companies
    that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by
    themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure
    of REIT operating performance and defines FFO as net income
    (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States), excluding gains (or losses) from
    sales of depreciable property, premiums or original issuance
    costs associated with preferred stock redemptions, plus
    depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The use of FFO,
    combined with the required presentations, has been fundamentally
    beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results of
    REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT
    operating results more meaningful. We generally consider FFO to
    be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and
    financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in
    conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of
    performance) because by excluding gains or losses related to
    sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and
    excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO
    can help one compare the operating performance of a
    Company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
    different companies. We believe that FFO is the best measure of
    economic profitability for real estate investment trusts.

The following table outlines our FFO calculation and
    reconciliation to GAAP for the three years ended
    December 31, 2008 adjusted for the Special Dividend

    traditional long-term investment in real estate for REITs.

Results
    of Operations

The following discussion includes the results of both continuing
    and discontinued operations for the periods presented.

Net
    Income Available to Common Stockholders

2008 -vs-2007

Net income available to common stockholders was
    $697.8 million ($4.95 per diluted share) for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to $205.2 million ($1.41
    per diluted share) for the comparable period in the prior year
    after adjustment for the Special Dividend. The increase in net
    income available to common



stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted
    primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed
    in further detail elsewhere within this Report.

•

An increase of $547.3 million in the gains on the
    disposition of our property inclusive of gains on sale to a
    joint venture;

•

A decrease of $42.1 million in total interest expense due
    in part to the Company recognizing gains of $29.6 on the
    extinguishment of certain unsecured debt instruments;

•

An increase of $16.9 million related to interest income
    generated by the Company; and

•

A gain of $3.1 million related to the repurchase of shares
    of our Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at
    less than their liquation value

The increases to our net income available to common stockholders
    were offset by: a reduction in property NOI of
    $80.2 million due to our dispositions; an increase in
    minority interest of $34.7 million; and an increase in
    general and administrative expense of $7.6 million when
    compared to 2007.

2007-vs.-2006

Net income available to common stockholders was
    $205.2 million ($1.41 per diluted share) for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to $113.2 million ($0.78
    per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2006
    after adjustment for the Special Dividend. The increase for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, when compared to the same
    period in 2006, resulted primarily from the following items, all
    of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this
    Report:

•

$98.7 million more in gains recognized from the sale of
    depreciable property in 2007;

•

$11.4 million more in apartment community operating results
    in 2007;

•

$3.2 million less in interest expense in 2007; and

•

$1.5 million less in distributions on preferred shares in
    2007.

These increases in income were partially offset by: a
    $13.6 million increase in real estate depreciation and
    amortization expense; an $8.4 million increase in general
    and administrative expense; $4.3 million in severance costs
    and other restructuring charges in 2007; $2.3 million in
    premiums on preferred stock repurchases in 2007; and a
    $0.9 million decrease in non-property income during 2007
    when compared to 2006.

Apartment
    Community Operations

Our net income is primarily generated from the operation of our
    apartment communities. The following table summarizes the
    operating performance of our total apartment portfolio which

    December 31, 2008) which consisted of 32,124 apartment
    homes and provided 74% of our property NOI for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

NOI for our same community properties increased 3.8% or
    $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    compared to the same period in 2007. The increase in property
    NOI was primarily attributable to a 3.6% or $14.8 million
    increase in rental revenues and other income partially offset by
    a 3.1% or $4.1 million increase in operating expenses. The
    increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 1.4% or
    $6.0 million increase in rental rates, a 13.9% or
    $2.0 million increase in reimbursement income, and a 76.9%
    or $4.3 million decrease in rental concessions. Physical
    occupancy increased 0.3% to 94.8% and total income per occupied
    home increased $37 to $1,176.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 5.9% or $2.3 million increase in real estate taxes due
    to higher assessed values on our communities and favorable tax
    appeals in 2007 and a 5.4% or $1.7 million increase in
    personnel costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
    net operating income divided by property rental income)
    increased to 68.3% as compared to 68.1% in the comparable period
    in the prior year.

2007-vs.-2006

Our same communities (those communities acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to January 1, 2006 and held on
    December 31, 2007, which consisted of 30,686 apartment
    homes) provided 57% of our property net operating income for the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

Same community property net operating income increased 7.0% or
    $17.7 million compared to 2006. The increase in property
    operating income was primarily attributable to a 5.0% or
    $18.8 million increase in revenues from rental and other
    income and a 0.9% or $1.1 million increase in operating
    expenses. The increase in revenues from rental and other income
    was primarily driven by a 4.2% or $16.2 million increase in



rental rates, an 11.4% or $3.0 million increase in
    reimbursement income and fee income, and a 16.2% or
    $1.0 million decrease in rental concessions. These
    increases were partially offset by a 6.8% or $1.3 million
    increase in vacancy loss. Physical occupancy decreased 0.2% to
    94.6%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 5.2% or $1.8 million increase in real estate taxes
    that was partially offset by a 7.6% or $0.8 million
    decrease in administrative and marketing costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
    operating income divided by property rental income) increased
    1.3% to 68.2%.

Non-Mature
    Communities

2008-vs.-2007

The remaining $103.6 million and $196.5 million of our
    NOI during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities.” UDR’s non-mature
    communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria
    to be included in same communities, which includes communities
    developed or acquired, redevelopment properties, sold
    properties, properties classified as real estate held for
    disposition and condominium properties. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we recognized NOI for our developments
    of $7.5 million, acquired communities of
    $46.0 million, redeveloped properties of $19.2 million
    and sold properties of $25.0 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we recognized net operating income for
    our developments of $4.0 million, acquired communities of
    $6.6 million, redeveloped properties of $14.9 million
    and sold properties of $146.1 million. In addition, in 2007
    the Company sold a portfolio of properties into a joint venture
    that we continue to manage after the transaction and as such is
    not deemed discontinued operations. The NOI from those
    communities was $18.3 million.

2007-vs.-2006

The non-mature communities net operating income for the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is derived largely from
    acquisitions, developments, redevelopments and dispositions as
    the Company executed our strategy to enhance our portfolio in
    high barrier-to-entry markets.

Other
    Income

For the year ended December 31, 2008, significant amounts
    reflected in other income include: interest income from a note
    for $200 million that the Company received related to the
    disposition of 86 properties during 2008; interest from
    uninvested 1031 proceeds; and fees earned for both recurring and
    non-recurring items related to the Company’s joint
    ventures. At December 31, 2008, the Company had redeployed
    all 1031 proceeds.

Tax
    Benefit for TRS

UDR elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated
    as Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (“TRS”). Income taxes for
    our TRS are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future
    tax consequences attributable to differences between the
    financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate
    is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date.
    For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 we
    have recognized a benefit due to the results of operations and
    temporary differences associated with the TRS.

Other
    Operating Expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the increase in other
    operating expenses is primarily due to additional costs incurred
    by the Company related to ground leases. In December 2007 and in
    July 2008, we



purchased operating communities that were subject to long-term
    ground leases. A schedule of future obligations related to
    ground leases is set forth under “Contractual
    Obligations” below.

Real
    Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2008, real estate
    depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
    discontinued operations decreased 2.1% or $5.5 million as
    compared to the comparable period in 2007. The decrease in
    depreciation and amortization for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 is a result of the Company’s
    repositioning efforts that included the sale of 86 operating
    communities. As the properties sold in 2008 did not meet the
    criteria to be deemed as held-for-sale the communities until
    late in the fourth quarter of 2008, we did not cease
    depreciation until that time. With the proceeds from the sale,
    the Company purchased $1.0 billion of properties. As part
    of our allocation of fair value associated with the purchase
    price, we attributed $14.0 million to in-place leases for
    our multi-family communities, which are generally amortized over
    an 11 month period. During the year ended December 31,
    2008, the Company recorded $3.7 million of depreciation
    related to two properties that we had previously been marketing
    as condominiums and classified as held-for-sale when we
    determined it prudent to operate the communities.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, real estate
    depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
    discontinued operations increased $13.6 million or 5.6%
    compared to 2006, primarily due to the significant increase in
    per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio and
    other capital expenditures.

Interest
    Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2008, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 23.7% or
    $42.1 million as compared to 2007. This decrease is
    primarily due to the Company recognizing a gain of
    $29.6 million on debt extinguishment that was partially
    offset by a $4.2 million prepayment penalty incurred by the
    Company in refinancing a secured debt instrument in 2008. The
    gain on debt extinguishment was a result of the Company
    repurchasing unsecured debt securities with a notional amount of
    $207.7 million in the open market throughout the year. In
    addition, the weighted average interest rate decreased from 5.3%
    in 2007 to 4.9% in 2008, which further reduced our interest
    expense. The decrease in the weighted average interest rate
    during 2008 reflects short-term bank borrowings and variable
    rate debt that had lower interest rates in 2008 when compared to
    the same period in 2007.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 1.7% or
    $3.2 million compared to 2006. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the weighted average amount of debt
    outstanding increased 5.9% or $193.8 million compared to
    2006 and the weighted average interest rate decreased from 5.4%
    in 2006 to 5.3% in 2007. The weighted average amount of debt
    outstanding during 2007 was slightly higher than 2006 as
    acquisition costs in 2007 have been funded primarily by the
    issuance of debt. The decrease in the weighted average interest
    rate during 2007 reflects short-term bank borrowings and
    variable rate debt that had lower interest rates in 2007 when
    compared to the same period in 2006.

General
    and Administrative

For the year ended December 31, 2008, general and
    administrative expenses increased 19.2% or $7.6 million as
    compared to 2007. The increase was due to a number of factors,
    including the Company writing off acquisition-related costs, the
    Company no longer pursuing a condominium strategy resulted in
    writing off $1.7 million in deferred sales charges, the
    renegotiation

and/or

cancellation of certain operating leases

and/or

vendor contracts of $0.8 million, the Company cancelling a
    contract to acquire a pre-sale property resulting in a charge of
    $1.7 million and the Company acquiring certain contractual
    rights related to a joint venture resulted in the Company
    incurring a charge of $305,000 for the profit component of the
    contracts.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, general and
    administrative expenses increased $8.4 million or 26.8%
    compared to 2006. The increase was due to a number of factors,
    including increases in personnel costs, incentive compensation,
    and legal and professional fees.



Severance
    Costs and Other Restructuring Charges

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recognized $653,000 of severance and restructuring charges as
    the Company continued to consolidate our operations in Highlands
    Ranch, Colorado. In addition, we announced reductions to certain
    positions related to both operations and corporate.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, UDR recognized
    $4.3 million in severance costs and other restructuring
    charges partly as a result of our disposition of 86 communities
    consisting of 25,684 apartment homes. As a result of a
    comprehensive review of the organizational structure of UDR and
    its operations, UDR recorded a charge of $3.6 million
    during the fourth quarter of 2007 related to workforce
    reductions, relocation costs, and other related costs. These
    charges are included in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations within the line item “Severance costs and other
    restructuring charges.” All charges were approved by
    management and our Board of Directors in October 2007. The
    Company had a zero balance related to the 2007 charges as of
    December 31, 2008.

Gains on
    the Sale of Land and Depreciable Property

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we
    recognized after-tax gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $786.4 million, $239.1 million and
    $140.3 million, respectively. Changes in the level of gains
    recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of
    our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the
    extent of gains related to specific properties sold.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. Substantially all of our leases
    are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our
    risk from the adverse effects of inflation.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

UDR has entered into one contract to purchase an apartment
    community of 289 homes in Dallas, Texas for approximately
    $29.0 million upon completion of its development. This
    apartment community is expected to be completed in the fourth
    quarter of 2009.

Other than the purchase contract listed above, we do not have
    any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably
    likely to have, a current or future material effect on our
    financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or
    expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
    or capital resources.

(b)

For purposes of our ground lease
    contracts, the Company uses the minimum lease payment, if stated
    in the agreement. For ground lease agreements where there is a
    reset provision based on the communities appraised value or
    consumer price index but does not included a specified minimum
    lease payment, the Company uses the current rent over the
    remainder of the lease term.

During 2008, we incurred gross interest costs of
    $177.8 million, of which $14.9 million was capitalized.

Factors
    Affecting Our Business and Prospects

There are many factors that affect our business and the results
    of our operations, some of which are beyond our control. These
    factors include:

•

general economic factors;

•

unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions
    that could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates;

•

the failure of acquisitions to achieve anticipated results;

•

possible difficulty in selling apartment communities;

•

the timing and closing of planned dispositions under agreement;

•

competitive factors that may limit our ability to lease
    apartment homes or increase or maintain rents;

•

insufficient cash flow that could affect our debt financing and
    create refinancing risk;

•

failure to generate sufficient revenue, which could impair our
    debt service payments and distributions to stockholders;

•

development and construction risks that may impact our
    profitability;

•

potential damage from natural disasters, including hurricanes
    and other weather-related events, which could result in
    substantial costs to us;

•

risks from extraordinary losses for which we may not have
    insurance or adequate reserves;

•

uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insurance
    retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess
    of applicable coverage;

•

delays in completing developments and

lease-ups

on
    schedule;

•

our failure to succeed in new markets;

•

changing interest rates, which could increase interest costs and
    affect the market price of our securities;

•

potential liability for environmental contamination, which could
    result in substantial costs to us;

•

the imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a REIT
    under the Internal Revenue Code in any taxable year;

•

our internal control over financial reporting may not be
    considered effective which could result in a loss of investor
    confidence in our financial reports, and in turn have an adverse
    effect on our stock price; and

•

changes in real estate laws, tax laws and other laws affecting
    our business.

A discussion of these and other factors affecting our business
    and prospects is set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk
    Factors. We encourage investors to review these risk factors.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2008, we carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures
    are designed with the objective of ensuring that information
    required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
    alerting them to material information required to be included in
    our periodic SEC reports.

It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is
    based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
    future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
    will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
    future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective under
    circumstances where our disclosure controls and procedures
    should reasonably be expected to operate effectively.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

UDR’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, our Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations (COSO).

Based on UDR’s evaluation, management concluded that our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2008.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Report, has audited UDR’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008. The report of Ernst & Young
    LLP, which expresses an unqualified opinion on UDR’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, is included under the heading
    “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” contained in
    this Report.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
    concluded that during the quarter ended December 31, 2008,
    there has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
    to materially affect, our internal control over financial
    reporting.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of
    Directors and Stockholders of

UDR, Inc.

We have audited UDR, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). UDR, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, UDR, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of UDR, Inc. as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008 of UDR, Inc. and our report dated
    February 20, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

UDR, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    UDR, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008
    and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of UDR, Inc. at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), UDR,
    Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 20, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

DECEMBER 31, 2008

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization,
    formation and special dividend

UDR, Inc. (“UDR”, the “Company”
    “we” or “our”) is a self-administered real
    estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires,
    renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities generally
    in high barrier-to-entry markets located in the United States.
    The high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited
    land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement
    process, expensive single-family home prices and significant
    employment growth potential. At December 31, 2008, our
    apartment portfolio consisted of 161 wholly-owned communities
    located in 23 markets consisting of 44,388 apartment homes. In
    addition, the Company has an ownership interest in 4,158
    apartment units through joint ventures.

On November 5, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend on a pre-adjusted basis of $1.29 per share (“the
    Special Dividend”) (approximately $132.0 million or
    $1.19 per share adjusted for the Special Dividend) payable to
    holders of our common stock. The dividend was paid on
    January 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on
    December 9, 2008. The dividend represented the
    Company’s 2008 fourth quarter recurring distribution of
    $0.33 per share ($0.305 per share adjusted for the Special
    Dividend) and an additional special distribution in the amount
    of $0.96 per share ($0.89 per share adjusted for the Special
    Dividend) due to taxable income arising from our disposition
    activity occurring during the year. Subject to the
    Company’s right to pay the entire dividend in cash,
    stockholders had the option to make an election to receive
    payment in cash or in shares, however, the aggregate amount of
    cash payable to stockholders, other than cash payable in lieu of
    fractional shares, would not be less than $44.0 million.

The Special Dividend, totaling $177.1 million was paid on
    137,266,557 shares issued and outstanding on the record
    date. Approximately $133.1 million of the Special Dividend
    was paid through the issuance of 11,358,042 shares of
    common stock, which was determined based on the volume weighted
    average closing sales price of our common stock of $11.71 per
    share on the NYSE on January 21, 2009 and January 22,
    2009. The effect of the issuance of additional shares of common
    stock pursuant to the Special Dividend has been retroactively
    reflected in each of the historical periods presented within
    this filing as if those shares were issued and outstanding at
    the beginning of the earliest period presented. Accordingly, all
    activity including share issuances, repurchases and forfeitures
    have been adjusted to reflect an 8.27% increase in the number of
    shares, except where noted otherwise.

Basis of
    presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of UDR and
    its wholly-owned subsidiaries, includes certain joint ventures
    and variable interest entities where we are the primary
    beneficiary as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46 R
    (“FIN 46 R”), “Consolidation of
    Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB
    No. 51”. All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company’s subsidiaries include United Dominion Realty,
    L.P., (the “Operating Partnership”), and Heritage
    Communities L.P. (the “Heritage OP”), (collectively,
    “UDR”). As of December 31, 2008, there were
    179,848,233 units in the Operating Partnership outstanding,
    of which 171,919,064 units or 96% were owned by UDR and
    7,929,169 units or 4% were owned by limited partners. As of
    December 31, 2008, there were 6,000,323 units in the
    Heritage OP outstanding, of which 5,814,507 units or 97%
    were owned by UDR and 185,816 units or 3% were owned by
    limited partners. The Consolidated Financial Statements of UDR
    include the minority interests of the unitholders in the
    Operating Partnership and the Heritage OP.

Investment
    in joint ventures

We use the equity method to account for investments that qualify
    as variable interest entities, variable interest entities where
    we are not the primary beneficiary and entities that we do not
    control or where we do



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

not own a majority of the economic interest but have the ability
    to exercise significant influence over the operating and
    financial policies of the investee. The Company will also use
    the equity method when we function as the managing member and
    our joint venture partner has substantive participating rights
    or where we can be replaced by our joint venture partner as
    managing member without cause. For a joint venture accounted for
    under the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses is
    reflected as income when earned and distributions are credited
    against our investment in the joint venture as received.

In determining whether a joint venture is a variable interest
    entity, the Company considers: the form of our ownership
    interest and legal structure; the size of our investment; the
    financing structure of the entity, including necessity of
    subordinated debt; estimates of future cash flows; ours and our
    partner’s ability to participate in the decision making
    related to acquisitions, disposition, budgeting and financing of
    the entity; obligation to absorb losses and preferential
    returns; nature of our partner’s primary operations; and
    the degree, if any, of disproportionally between the economic
    and voting interests of the entity. As of December 31,
    2008, the Company did not assess any of our joint ventures as
    variable interest entities where UDR was the primary beneficiary.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
    disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the
    financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid
    could differ from those estimates. Certain previously reported
    amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
    financial statement presentation.

Discontinued
    operations

For properties accounted for under SFAS 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“SFAS 144”) , the results of
    operations for those properties sold during the year or
    classified as held-for-sale at the end of the current year are
    classified as discontinued operations in the current and prior
    periods. Further, to meet the discontinued operations criteria,
    the Company will not have any significant continuing involvement
    in the ownership or operation of the property after the sale or
    disposition. Once a property is deemed as held-for-sale,
    depreciation is no longer recorded. However, if the Company
    determines that the property no longer meets the criteria for
    held-for-sale, the Company will recapture any unrecorded
    depreciation on the property. The sales related to condominium
    units are also included in discontinued operations.

Real
    estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical
    cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements, furniture,
    fixtures and equipment and other costs incurred during their
    development, acquisition and redevelopment.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are
    charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements,
    renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition

and/or

improvement of real estate assets are capitalized and
    depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the
    expenditures qualify as a betterment or the life of the related
    asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life
    expectancy.

UDR purchases real estate investment properties and allocates
    the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired based on their estimated fair value. The
    primary, although not only, identifiable intangible asset
    associated with our portfolio is the value of existing lease
    agreements. When allocating cost to an acquired community, we
    first allocate costs to the estimated intangible value of the
    existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the
    land, building and fixtures assuming the community is vacant.
    The Company estimates the intangible value of the lease
    agreements by determining the



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

lost revenue associated with a hypothetical

lease-up.

Depreciation on the building is based on the expected useful
    life of the asset and the in-place leases are amortized over
    their remaining contractual life.

Quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant, UDR will
    assess our real estate portfolio for indicators of impairment.
    In determining whether the Company has indicators of impairment
    in our real estate assets, we assess whether the long-lived
    asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s
    undiscounted future cash flows, which is representative of
    projected NOI plus the residual value of the community. Our
    future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results
    adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and
    operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. If such
    indicators of impairment are present and the excess carrying
    value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community based
    on a probability weighted model, an impairment loss is
    recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the
    asset over its estimated fair value. Our estimates of fair
    market value represent our best estimate based upon industry
    trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are
    recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost
    to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition generally
    represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted
    for sale which are expected to close within the next twelve
    months. Real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower
    of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less
    the cost to dispose, determined on an

asset-by-asset

basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on
    held for disposition properties are charged to expense as
    incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and
    replacements related to held for disposition properties are
    capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate
    held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets which are
    35 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major
    improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures,
    equipment, and other assets. As of December 31, 2008, the
    value of our net intangible assets which are reflected in
    “Other assets” was $10.7 million and the value of
    our net intangible liabilities which are reflected in
    “Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other
    liabilities” was $7.2 million in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The balances are being amortized over the
    remaining life of the respective intangible.

All development projects and related carrying costs are
    capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
    “Real estate under development.” As each building in a
    project is completed and becomes available for

lease-up,

the total cost of the building is transferred to real estate
    held for investment and the assets are depreciated over their
    estimated useful lives. The cost of development projects
    includes interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated
    development overhead during the construction period.

Interest, real estate taxes, insurance and allocated development
    overhead related to support costs for personnel working directly
    on the development site are capitalized as part of the real
    estate under development to the extent that such charges do not
    cause the carrying value of the asset to exceed its net
    realizable value. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, total interest
    capitalized was $14.9 million, $13.2 million, and
    $5.2 million, respectively.

Cash and
    cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand
    deposits with financial institutions and short-term, highly
    liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid investments
    with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. The majority of the Company’s cash and
    cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks.

Restricted
    cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for
    real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and
    security deposits.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Escrow —
    1031 exchange funds

In most cases, disposition proceeds are set aside and designated
    to fund future tax-deferred exchanges of qualifying real estate
    investments. If these proceeds are not redeployed to qualifying
    real estate investment within 180 days, these funds are
    redesignated as cash and cash equivalents.

Derivative
    financial instruments

The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage
    interest rate risk and will generally designate these financial
    instruments as a cash flow hedge. Derivative financial
    instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as
    either an asset or liability and measured quarterly at their
    fair value. The changes in fair value for cash flow hedges that
    are deemed effective are reflected in other comprehensive income
    and for non-designated derivative financial instruments in
    earnings. For cash flow hedges the ineffective component, if
    any, is recorded in earnings.

Cost of
    raising capital

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of equity
    securities are deducted from stockholders equity. Costs incurred
    in connection with the issuance or renewal of debt is subject to
    the provisions of

EITF 96-19,

“Debtors’ Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments”. Accordingly, if the terms of the renewed
    or modified debt instrument are deemed to be substantially
    different (i.e. a 10 percent or greater difference in the
    cash flows between instruments), all unamortized financing costs
    associated with the extinguished debt are charged to earnings in
    the current period. When the cash flows are not substantially
    different, the costs associated with the renewal or modification
    are capitalized and amortized into interest expense over the
    term of the related debt instrument. The balance of any
    unamortized financing costs associated with retired debt is
    expensed upon retirement. Deferred financing costs for new debt
    instruments include fees and costs incurred by the Company to
    obtain financing. Deferred financing costs are generally
    amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the
    effective interest method, over a period not to exceed the term
    of the related debt.

Preferred
    share redemptions

When redeeming preferred stock, the Company recognizes share
    issuance costs as a charge to the preferred stock on a pro rata
    basis to the total costs incurred for the preferred stock
    offering.

The Company, during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006, recognized share issuance costs of $828,000,
    $2.3 million and $0, respectively as part of the amount
    reported in “Discount/(premium) on preferred stock
    repurchases, net”.

Comprehensive
    income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in equity
    during each period except for those resulting from investments
    by or distributions to stockholders, is displayed in the
    accompanying Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and
    Comprehensive Income. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
    other comprehensive income consisted of the change in the fair
    value of effective cash flow hedges from our consolidated
    subsidiaries and our proportionate percentage of an
    unconsolidated joint venture in which UDR has elected to utilize
    hedge accounting.

Revenue
    and real estate sales gain recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual
    basis when due from residents in accordance with
    SFAS No. 13 “Accounting for Leases”
    (SFAS 13) and SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition”.
    Rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis and
    recognized when earned. The



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company recognizes interest income, management and other fees
    and incentives when earned, fixed and determinable.

The Company accounts for sales of real estate in accordance with
    SFAS 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”.
    For sale transactions meeting the requirements for full accrual
    profit recognition, such as the Company no longer having
    continuing involvement in the property, we remove the related
    assets and liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheet and
    record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes.
    For sale transactions that do not meet the full accrual sale
    criteria due to our continuing involvement, we evaluate the
    nature of the continuing involvement and account for the
    transaction under an alternate method of accounting.

Sales to entities in which we retain or otherwise own an
    interest are accounted for as partial sales. If all other
    requirements for recognizing profit under the full accrual
    method have been satisfied and no other forms of continuing
    involvement are present, we recognize profit proportionate to
    the outside interest in the buyer and will defer the gain on the
    interest we retain. The Company will recognize any deferred gain
    when the property is then sold to a third party. In transactions
    accounted by us as partial sales, we determine if the buyer of
    the majority equity interest in the venture was provided a
    preference as to cash flows in either an operating or a capital
    waterfall. If a cash flow preference has been provided, we
    recognize profit only to the extent that proceeds from the sale
    of the majority equity interest exceed costs related to the
    entire property.

Advertising
    costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item
    “Administrative and marketing”. During 2008, 2007, and
    2006, total advertising expense was $6.1 million,
    $7.8 million, and $9.3 million, respectively.

Stock-based
    employee compensation plans

UDR adopted FASB Statement No. 123(R), “Share-Based
    Payments,” (SFAS 123(R)) on January 1, 2006 using
    the modified prospective method. SFAS 123(R) requires an
    entity to measure the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the
    award’s fair value on the grant date and recognize the cost
    over the period during which the employee is required to provide
    service in exchange for the award, which is generally the
    vesting period. The fair value for stock options issued by the
    Company is calculated utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton
    formula. For performance based awards, the Company remeasures
    the fair value each balance sheet date with adjustment made on a
    cumulative basis until the award is settled and the final
    compensation is known. The adoption of the provisions of
    SFAS 123(R) did not have a material impact on our financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Minority
    interests of unitholders in operating partnerships

Interests in operating partnerships held by limited partners are
    represented by operating partnership units
    (“OP Units”). The income is allocated to holders
    of OP Units based upon net income available to common
    stockholders and the weighted average number of OP Units
    outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units
    outstanding during the period. Capital contributions,
    distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to minority
    interests in accordance with the terms of the individual
    partnership agreements. Operating Partnership units can be
    exchanged for cash or shares of UDR’s common stock on a
    one-for-one basis, at the option of UDR. Heritage OP units can
    be exchanged for cash or shares of UDR’s common stock on a
    1.575 for one basis, at the option of UDR.

Earnings
    per share

Basic earnings per common share is computed based upon the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based upon
    common



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive stock options and
    other potentially dilutive common stock equivalents. The
    dilutive effect of stock options and other potentially dilutive
    common stock equivalents is determined using the treasury stock
    method based on UDR’s average stock price. The number of
    shares used to compute basic and dilutive earnings per share
    have been adjusted to reflect the Special Dividend.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
    diluted earning per share

The effect of the conversion of the operating partnership units,
    stock options, convertible preferred stock, and convertible
    debt, is not dilutive and is therefore not included in the above
    calculations.

If the operating partnership units were converted to common
    stock adjusted for the Special Dividend, the additional shares
    of common stock outstanding for the three years ended
    December 31, 2008, would be 9,474,668, 8,403,605 and
    9,412,539 weighted average common shares, respectively.

At December 31, 2008, if the measurement period had ended
    on that date, no Series E Out-Performance Partnership
    Shares would have been issued had the Program terminated on that
    date. Accordingly, no additional operating partnership units
    would have been issued at that date and are not included in
    diluted earnings per share.

If the convertible preferred stock were converted to common
    stock, the additional shares of common stock outstanding for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, would be
    3,035,548 weighted average common shares.

Income
    taxes

UDR is operated as, and elects to be taxed as a REIT. Generally,
    a REIT complies with the provisions of the Code if it meets
    certain requirements concerning its income and assets, as well
    as if it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to
    its stockholders and will not be subject to U.S. federal
    income taxes if it distributes at least 100% of its income.
    Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes
    of the REIT. UDR is subject to certain state and local excise or
    franchise taxes, for which provision has been made. If we fail
    to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, our taxable income
    will be subject to United States Federal income tax at regular
    corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum
    tax). Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain
    state and local income taxes and to United States Federal income
    tax. We also will be required to pay a 100% tax on non-arms
    length transactions between us and a taxable REIT subsidiary and
    on any net income from sales of property that the IRS
    successfully asserts was property held for sale to customers in
    the ordinary course.

UDR elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated
    as Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (“TRS”) relating to the
    Company’s developer, RE3 and condominium conversion
    activities. Income taxes for our TRS are accounted for under the
    asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for

future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
    financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate
    is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date.

Market
    concentration risk

Approximately 13.6% and 11.9% of our apartment communities are
    located in Orange County, CA and Metropolitan Washington, D.C.,
    respectively, based on the carrying value of our real estate
    portfolio as of December 31, 2008. Therefore, the Company
    is subject to increased exposure (positive or negative) from
    economic and other competitive factors specific to those markets.

Impact of
    recently issued accounting pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations,” (“SFAS 141R”).
    SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how
    the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its
    financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
    liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the
    acquiree. The statement also provides guidance for recognizing
    and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination,
    recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from
    contingencies, and determining what information to disclose to
    enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature
    and financial effects of the business combination.
    SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008. We believe that the adoption of
    SFAS 141R could materially impact our future consolidated
    financial position and results of operations depending on the
    Company’s acquisition activity as certain acquisition costs
    that have historically been capitalized as part of the basis of
    the real estate and amortized over the real estate’s useful
    life will now be expensed as incurred.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements” (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160
    amends Accounting Research Bulletin 51, “Consolidated
    Financial Statements” to establish accounting and reporting
    standards for the non-controlling (minority) interest in a
    subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It
    clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary should
    be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.
    Consolidated net income should include the net income for both
    the parent and the non-controlling interest with disclosure of
    both amounts on the consolidated statement of operations. The
    calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on
    income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS 160 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. We are currently assessing what impact the adoption of
    SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial position
    and results of operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161
    requires enhanced disclosures related to derivatives and hedging
    activities. SFAS 161 will require disclosures relating to:
    (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments;
    (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedge items are
    accounted for under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”; and
    (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    affect an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 must be applied
    prospectively and will be effective for our fiscal year
    beginning January 1, 2009, although early adoption is
    allowed. We believe that the adoption of SFAS 161 will not
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position APB

14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion” (“APB

14-1”).

APB

14-1

requires entities that issued certain convertible debt
    instruments that may be settled or partially settled in cash on
    conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and
    equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

manner that reflects the entity’s nonconvertible debt
    borrowing rate. APB

14-1

requires that an entity determine the estimated fair value of a
    similar debt instrument as of the date of the issuance without
    the conversion feature but inclusive of any other embedded
    features such as puts and calls and assign that value to the
    debt component of the instrument, which would result in a
    discount being recorded. The debt would subsequently be accreted
    to its par value over its expected life using the market rate at
    the date of issuance. The residual value between the initial
    proceeds and the value allocated to the debt would be reflected
    in equity as additional paid in capital. APB

14-1

is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008 and would be applied retrospectively to both new and
    existing convertible instruments. We believe that the adoption
    of APB

14-1

will result in the Company incurring an additional
    $6.0 million to $10.0 in annual non-cash interest charges,
    prior to capitalization of interest as a result of development
    activities.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 162, “The Hierarchy
    of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”
    (“SFAS 162”). SFAS 162 provides the
    framework for selecting the principles to be used in the
    preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally
    accepted accounting principles. SFAS 162 will become
    effective 60 days following the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s approval. We believe that the adoption of
    SFAS 162 will not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB Issued FASB Staff Position No

EITF 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted In Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities

(EITF 03-6-1).

EITF 03-6-1

claries that unvested share-based payment awards with a right to
    receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities
    which results in the entity computing basic EPS using the
    two-class method. These awards are considered participating
    securities as the award holders participate in distributions of
    earnings with common stock holders from the date the award is
    granted since no service is required to earn the dividend.

EITF 03-6-1

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. We are currently assessing what impact the adoption of

EITF 03-6-1

will have on our EPS.

(c)

This community was acquired by the Company while under
    development and is projected to be completed in the first
    quarter of 2009.

The Company also acquired a shopping center to be a cornerstone
    in a master development planned by the Company. The shopping
    center located in the Dallas, Texas market was purchased for
    $19.2 million, which included a $9.6 million note owed
    by the Company to the seller bearing interest at a rate of 5.0%
    per annum and due in November 2010.

The purchase prices of certain recent acquisitions were
    allocated to land; building and improvements; furniture,
    fixtures and equipment; and intangible assets based on
    preliminary estimates and are subject to change as we obtain
    more complete information.

The purchase of three of the communities during the year ended
    December 31, 2008 relate to the pre-sale agreements
    previously entered into by UDR, which contain provisions that
    will require the Company and the builder to jointly agree upon
    the fair market value of each property at a later point in time
    (generally within two years of stabilization). A percentage of
    the increase in the fair market value over cost will then be
    paid to the developer, ranging from 50% to 70%, which is not
    included in the initial purchase price listed in the table above
    nor is the contingent obligation accrued for by the Company.

The Company continued to reinvest proceeds from dispositions

(see Note 3 — Discontinued Operations)

. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Company had entered into a
    binding agreement for one pre-sale 289 apartment unit real
    estate asset for $29.0 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    terminated a pre-sale arrangement for a community located in
    Orlando, Florida. As a result of terminating the contract the
    Company incurred a write-off of $1.7 million.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

The results of operations for properties sold during the year or
    designated as held-for-sale at the end of the year are
    classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
    Properties classified as real estate held for disposition
    generally represent properties that are actively marketed or
    contracted for sale which are expected to close within the next
    twelve months. The application of SFAS 144 does not have an
    impact on net income available to common stockholders. The
    application of SFAS 144 results in the reclassification of
    the operating results of all properties sold or classified as
    held for disposition through December 31, 2008, within the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, and the reclassification
    of the assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, if applicable.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, UDR sold 86
    communities, one commercial property, one parcel of land, and 53
    condominiums from two communities with a total of 640
    condominiums. UDR recognized after-tax gains for financial
    reporting purposes of $786.4 million on these sales. At
    December 31, 2008, UDR did not have any assets that met the
    criteria to be included in discontinued operations. In
    conjunction with the sale of the 86 communities during 2008, UDR
    received a note in the amount of $200 million. The note
    which is secured by a pledge, security agreement and a guarantee
    from the buyer’s parent entity bears a fixed rate of
    interest of 7.5% per annum and matures on March 31, 2014,
    provided however that the master credit facility agreement
    pursuant to which the buyer financed the acquisition of the
    properties provides that the buyer will pay or prepay the note
    on or before the date that is fourteen (14) months after
    the Initial Closing Date (May 3, 2009) and further
    that it is an event of default under the master credit facility
    agreement if the note is not paid in full by June 1, 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, UDR sold 21
    communities, 61 condominiums from two communities with a total
    of 640 condominiums, and one parcel of land. UDR recognized
    after-tax gains for

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

financial reporting purposes of $239.1 million on these
    sales, of which $125.3 million are included in discontinued
    operations. The remaining $113.8 million of gains
    recognized, related to the sale of nine additional communities
    and the contribution of one development property, at cost, to a
    joint venture in which UDR holds a 20% interest, and is reported
    as a component of continuing operations as disclosed in
    Note 4 — Joint Ventures. At December 31,
    2007, UDR had 86 communities with a net book value of
    $885.5 million, two communities with a total of 579
    condominiums and a net book value of $40.8 million, and one
    commercial unit with a net book value of $0.4 million
    included in real estate held for disposition.

During 2006, UDR sold 24 communities and 384 condominiums from
    four communities with a total of 612 condominiums. We recognized
    gains for financial reporting purposes of $140.3 million on
    these sales. Previously deferred gains for financial reporting
    purposes of $6.4 million were recognized during the year
    ended December 31, 2006. The results of operations for
    these properties and the interest expense associated with the
    secured debt on these properties are classified on the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations in the line item entitled
    “Income from discontinued operations, net of minority

    units will be reverted to operating apartment homes. In
    addition, as the Company reverted the former condominium
    properties to operating communities and removed operating

JOINT
    VENTURES

UDR has entered into joint ventures with unrelated third parties
    for real estate assets that are either consolidated and included
    in real estate owned on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or are
    accounted for under



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the equity method of accounting, which are not consolidated and
    are included in investment in unconsolidated joint ventures on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company will consolidate an
    entity in which we own less than 100% but control the joint
    venture as well as any variable interest entity where we are the
    primary beneficiary. In addition, the Company will consolidate
    any joint venture in which we are the general partner or
    managing member and the third party does not have the ability to
    substantively participate in the decision-making process nor do
    they have the ability to remove us as general partner or
    managing member, respectively without cause.

UDR’s joint ventures, some of which are variable interest
    entities, are funded with a combination of debt and capital. The
    allocation between debt and capital will vary by joint venture
    with our investments having a weighted average of 11% of the
    initial total assets as contributed capital. Our losses are
    limited to our investment and the Company does not guarantee any
    debt, capital payout or other obligations associated with our
    joint venture portfolio.

Consolidated
    Joint Venture

During 2008, we completed the development of a consolidated
    joint venture located in Marina del Rey, CA with 298 apartment
    homes and a carrying value of $139.3 million, which is
    currently in

lease-up.

In
    December 2008, we acquired for $1.5 million our joint
    venture partner’s interest in their profit participation
    and terminated the property management agreement that had
    approximately two years remaining on the pre-existing contract.
    As a result of terminating our arrangement, the Company recorded
    a charge to earnings of $305,000 as the profit component related
    to the management agreement and capitalized the balance as part
    of the investment in real estate. The component capitalized as
    the investment in real estate will be depreciated over the
    average remaining life of the tangible assets. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company included this property as a
    component of our wholly-owned communities.

Unconsolidated
    Joint Ventures

The Company recognizes earnings or losses from our investments
    in unconsolidated joint ventures consisting of our proportionate
    share of the net earnings or loss of the joint venture. In
    addition, we earn fees for providing management and development
    services to the unconsolidated joint ventures. As of
    December 31, 2008, UDR had investments in the following
    unconsolidated development joint ventures which are accounted
    for under the equity method of accounting.

UDR is a partner in a joint venture to develop a site in
    Bellevue, Washington. At closing, we owned 49% of the joint
    venture which the Company proposes to develop that involves
    building a 430 home high rise apartment building with ground
    floor retail. Our initial investment was $5.7 million. The
    project is currently ongoing and will commence construction once
    favorable financing has been obtained. Our investment at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was
    $10.2 million and $8.1 million, respectively.

UDR is a partner in a joint venture which will develop 274
    apartment homes in the central business district of Bellevue,
    Washington. Construction began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and
    is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2009. At
    closing, we owned 49% of the joint venture. Our initial
    investment was $10.0 million. Our investment at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was
    $9.9 million and $8.9 million, respectively.

UDR is a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint
    venture which owns and operates a recently completed 23-story,
    166 home high-rise apartment community in the central business
    district of Bellevue, Washington. At closing, UDR owned 49% of
    the joint venture. Our initial investment was
    $11.8 million. Our investment at December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007 was $10.4 million and
    $11.2 million, respectively.

UDR and an unaffiliated third party in November 2007 formed a
    joint venture which owns and operates various properties located
    in Texas. On the closing date, UDR sold nine operating
    properties, consisting of



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

3,690 units, and contributed one property under development
    to the joint venture. The property under development has
    302 units and was completed in 2008 and commenced lease up
    at that time. UDR contributed cash and property equal to 20% of
    the fair value of the properties. The unaffiliated member
    contributed cash equal to 80% of the fair value of the
    properties comprising the joint venture, which was then used to
    purchase the nine operating properties from UDR. Our initial
    investment was $20.4 million. Our investment at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was
    $16.5 million and $20.1 million, respectively. In
    addition, during the year ended December 30, 2008 UDR
    received payment in full for a note receivable of
    $18.8 million from the joint venture.

The operating results of the properties sold to the Texas joint
    venture are included as a component of continuing operations on
    the Consolidated Statement of Operations as UDR will continue to
    recognize significant cash flows from management fees over the
    term of the joint venture.

SECURED
    DEBT

Our secured debt instruments generally feature either monthly
    interest and principal or monthly interest-only payments with
    balloon payments due at maturity. For purposes of classification
    in the following table, variable rate debt with a derivative
    financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is deemed
    as fixed rate debt due to the Company having effectively
    established the interest rate for the underlying debt
    instrument. Secured debt on continuing and discontinued
    operations, which encumbers $2.1 billion or 37% of

    in connection with an equity offering where we received gross
    proceeds of $194.0 million;

•

    of common stock on an unadjusted basis) in connection with stock
    options exercised;

    Directors and are dependent upon our strategy, financial
    condition and operating results. UDR distributions, inclusive
    and adjusted for the Special Dividend for the years ended

    respectively. For taxable years ending on or before
    December 31, 2009, the IRS is allowing REITS to distribute
    up to 90% of total distributions in common shares with the
    residual distributed in cash as a means of enhancing liquidity.

Preferred
    Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
    (Series E) has no stated par value and a liquidation
    preference of $16.61 per share. Subject to certain adjustments
    and conditions, each share of the Series E is convertible
    at any time and from time to time at the holder’s option
    into one share of our common stock. The holders of the
    Series E are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis as a
    single class in combination with the holders of common stock at
    any meeting of our stockholders for the election of directors or
    for any other purpose on which the holders of common stock are
    entitled to vote. The Series E has no stated maturity and

    issuance upon conversion of the Series E additional shares
    of common stock to which a holder of the Series E would
    have received if the holder had converted the Series E
    immediately prior to the record date for the Special Dividend.

    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $1.33 and $1.33 per
    share, respectively. The Series E is not listed on any
    exchange. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, a total of
    2,803,812 shares of the Series E were outstanding,
    respectively. As a result of the Special Dividend the
    Series E shares can convert into 3,035,548 shares of
    Company common stock.

UDR is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of our
    Series F Preferred Stock (Series F). The Series F
    may be purchased by holders of UDR’s operating partnership
    units, or OP Units, at a purchase price of $0.0001 per
    share. OP Unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and
    purchase one share of UDR’s Series F for each
    OP Unit held. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, a total
    of 666,293 shares of the Series F were outstanding at
    a value of $67. Holders of the Series F are entitled to one
    vote for each share of the Series F they hold, voting
    together with the holders of our common stock, on each matter
    submitted to a vote of security holders at a meeting of our
    stockholders. The Series F does not entitle its holders to
    any other rights, privileges or preferences.

In May 2007, UDR issued 5,400,000 shares of our 6.75%
    Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock
    (Series G). The Series G has no stated par value and a
    liquidation preference of $25 per share. The Series G
    generally has no voting rights except under certain limited
    circumstances and as required by law. The Series G has no
    stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or
    mandatory redemption and is not convertible into any of our
    other securities. The Series G is not redeemable prior to
    May 31, 2012. On or after this date, the Series G may
    be redeemed for cash at our option, in whole or in part, at a
    redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid
    dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company redeemed 969,300 shares of Series G for less
    than the liquidation preference of $25 per share resulting in a

    stockholders.

    Series B in 2007 were $1.07 per share.

Dividend
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

UDR’s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the
    “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows common and preferred
    stockholders the opportunity to purchase, through the
    reinvestment of cash dividends, additional shares of UDR’s
    common stock. From inception through December 31, 2008,
    shareholders have elected to utilize the Stock Purchase Plan to
    reinvest their dividends for the equivalent of
    10,780,198 shares of Company common stock adjusted for the
    Special Dividend. Shares in the amount of 14,219,802 were
    reserved for issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan as of
    December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31,
    2008, UDR acquired all shares issued through the open market.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

UDR’s First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement was
    intended to protect long-term interests of stockholders in the
    event of an unsolicited, coercive or unfair attempt to take over
    UDR. The Plan authorized

a dividend of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (the
    “Rights”) on each share of common stock outstanding.
    Each Right entitled the holder to purchase


/


of a share of a new series of UDR’s preferred stock,
    designated as Series C Junior Participating Cumulative
    Preferred Stock, at a price to be determined upon the occurrence
    of the event, and for which the holder must be paid $45 should
    the takeover occur. Under the Plan, the Rights were exercisable
    if a person or group acquired more than 15% of UDR’s common
    stock or announced a tender offer that would result in the
    ownership of 15% of UDR’s common stock. The Plan and the
    Rights expired on February 4, 2008.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

In May 2001, the stockholders of UDR approved the long term
    incentive plan (“LTIP”), which supersedes the 1985
    Stock Option Plan. The LTIP authorizes the granting of awards
    which may take the form of options to purchase shares of common
    stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, dividend
    equivalents, other stock-based awards, and any other right or
    interest relating to common stock or cash incentive awards to
    Company directors, employees and outside trustees to promote the
    success of the Company by linking individual’s compensation
    via grants of share based payment. The Board of Directors
    reserved 4,000,000 shares on an unadjusted basis for
    issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards under the LTIP,
    which all can be for incentive stock option grants. The LTIP
    generally provides, among other things, that options are granted
    at exercise prices not lower than the market value of the shares
    on the date of grant and that options granted must be exercised
    within 10 years. As of December 31, 2008, there were
    1,373,994 common shares available for issuance under the LTIP.

The LTIP contains change of control provisions allowing for the
    immediate vesting of an award upon certain events such as a
    merger where UDR is not the surviving entity. Upon the death or
    disability of an award recipient all outstanding instruments
    will vest and all restrictions will lapse. Further, upon the
    retirement of an award, all outstanding instruments will vest
    and all restrictions will lapse. The LTIP specifies that in the
    event of a capital transaction, which includes but is not
    limited to stock dividends, stock split, extraordinary cash
    dividend and spin-off the number of shares available for grant
    in totality or to a single individual is to be adjusted
    proportionately. The LTIP specifies that when a capital
    transaction occurs that would dilute the holder of the stock
    award, prior grants are to be adjusted such that the recipient
    is no worse as a result of the capital transaction.

Stock
    Option Plan

UDR has granted stock options to our employees, subject to
    certain conditions. Each stock option is exercisable into one
    common share.

The weighted average remaining contractual life on all options
    outstanding as of December 31, 2008 is 3.5 years.
    245,611 of share options had exercise prices between $9.63 and
    $10.88, 523,296 of share options had exercise prices between
    $11.15 and $12.23, 89,419 of share options had exercise prices
    between $13.94 and $14.88 and 465,841 of share options had
    exercise prices between $26.40 and $27.17.

During the year ended December 31, 2008 we recognized
    $372,000 of net compensation expense related to our stock option
    grants.

Restricted
    Stock Awards

Restricted stock is granted to Company employees, officers,
    consultants, and directors. The restricted stock is valued on
    the grant date based upon the market price of UDR common stock
    on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recorded over the
    vesting period, which is generally three to four years.
    Restricted stock earn dividends payable in cash until the
    earlier of the date of the underlying restricted stock is
    exercised or the expiration of the underlying restricted stock
    award. Some of the restricted stock is performance based and is
    adjusted based on Company performance. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized
    $7.0 million, $6.1 million, and $4.5 million,
    respectively, of compensation expense related to the
    amortization of restricted stock, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had issued
    1,600,807 shares of restricted stock under the LTIP. Total
    remaining compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock
    awards as of December 31, 2008 was $8.8 million.

For income tax purposes, distributions paid to common
    stockholders may consist of ordinary income, qualified
    dividends, capital gains, unrecaptured section 1250 gains,
    return of capital, or a combination thereof. Distributions that
    exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits
    constitute a return of capital rather than taxable income and
    reduce the stockholder’s basis in their common shares. To
    the extent that a distribution exceeds both current and
    accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder’s
    basis in the common shares, it generally will be treated as a
    gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder’s common
    shares. For the three years ended December 31, 2008,

As of December 31, 2008, the Company through our TRSs had
    federal net loss carryovers (“NOL”) of approximately
    $48.5 million. Of the total NOL, $34.3 million
    ($12.0 million tax effected) will be carried back to
    previous years with the balance of $14.2 million expiring
    in 2028. As of December 31, 2008, the TRSs had state NOL of
    approximately $62.3 million, of which approximately
    $1.8 million begins to expire in 2012 with the remainder
    expiring in 2022 through 2028. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company had a valuation allowance of $15.3 million for
    deferred tax assets primarily related to certain inter-Company
    debt and interest deductions.

UDR adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes-An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109” (“FIN 48”), on January 1,
    2007. FIN 48 defines a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. FIN 48 requires the financial statements
    reflect expected future tax consequences of income tax positions
    presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the tax
    position and all relevant facts, but without considering time
    values. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim
    periods, disclosure and transition.

The Company evaluates our tax position using a two-step process.
    First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than
    not (greater than 50 percent probability) to be sustained
    upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or
    litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the
    position. Then the Company will determine the amount of benefit
    to recognize and record the amount of the benefit that is more
    likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. When
    applicable, UDR recognizes interest

and/or

penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax
    expense. As of December 31, 2008, we reduced our recognized
    tax benefits under FIN 48 as a result of a change in
    measurement of certain items.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties is

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair values of cash and
    cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable, escrow
    1031exchange funds, accounts receivable, prepaids, real estate
    taxes payable, accrued interest payable, security deposits and
    prepaid rent, distributions payable and accounts payable
    approximated their carrying values because of the short term
    nature of these instruments. The estimated fair values of other
    financial instruments were determined by the Company using
    available market information and appropriate valuation
    methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret
    market data and develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the
    estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the
    amounts the Company would realize on the disposition of the
    financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions
    or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
    estimated fair value amounts. The carrying amounts and estimated
    fair value of the Company’s financial instruments, where
    different, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, are summarized

Due to the terms of the notes receivables, the Company
    considered the note receivables to have a carrying amount equal
    to the estimated fair value. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company did not recognize an
    impairment on any of our notes receivable.

The Company has the ability to make public and private
    investments in equity and debt securities. The publicly traded
    equity securities would be classified as
    “available-for-sale securities” and carried at fair
    value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate
    component of stockholders equity. For publicly traded debt
    securities, the Company will initially assess our intent and
    ability to hold the debt instrument before determining the
    classification as either “held-to-maturity securities”
    which would be reported at their amortized cost or as an
    available-for-sale security. Private investments for which we
    lack the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted
    for at cost.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company enters into interest rate swap and interest rate cap
    instruments as a means to mitigating exposure to the impact of
    interest rate fluctuation associated with our variable rate
    debt. In order to reduce the risk of our counterparty defaulting
    on our derivative instruments, the Company will only enter into
    contracts with major financial institutions that maintain
    investment grade status. We do not hold derivative instruments
    for trading or other speculative purposes

The Company accounts for its derivative instruments in
    accordance with SFAS No 133 “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” and
    SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
    Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.

”

At
    December 31, 2008, UDR’s derivative financial
    instruments for our consolidated subsidiaries include swap
    agreements on eight interest rate hedges that we designate for
    hedge accounting, one interest rate cap that we designate for
    hedge accounting and four interest rate caps for which no
    designation was made. In addition, two of our unconsolidated
    joint ventures in which UDR has a 49% interest have a total of
    five interest rate swap agreements that are designated as cash
    flow hedges. In all cases the underlying debt instrument has a
    variable interest rate which the Company is attempting to fix or
    mitigate our exposure to interest rates rising about a
    pre-determined rate. These swaps and caps qualify for cash flow
    hedges for financial reporting purposes. For derivative
    instruments that we designated as cash flow hedges, the
    effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
    instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive
    income and reclassified into earnings during the same period or
    periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
    The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in
    excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future
    cash flows of the hedged item, if any, is recognized in current
    earnings during the period of change.

The fair value of UDR’s derivative instruments is reported
    on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at its current fair value.
    Estimated fair values for interest rate swaps and interest rate
    caps rely on prevailing market interest rates. The fair value
    amount should not be viewed in isolation, but rather in relation
    to the value of the underlying hedged transaction and investment
    and to the overall reduction in exposure to adverse fluctuations
    in interest rates. The interest rate swap and interest rate cap
    agreements are designated with a portion of the principal
    balance and term of a specific debt obligation. The interest
    rate swap involves the periodic exchange of payments over the
    life of the related agreement. Amounts received or paid on the
    interest rate swap are recorded on an accrual basis as an
    adjustment to the related interest expense of the outstanding
    debt based on the accrual method of accounting. The related
    amounts payable to and receivable from counterparties are
    included in other liabilities and other assets, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, UDR recognized
    $11.9 of unrealized losses on derivative financial instruments
    in other comprehensive income.

Effective January 1, 2008, UDR adopted SFAS 157, which
    defines fair value based on the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    at the measurement date. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value
    hierarchy



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to
    measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three
    broad levels, which are described below:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability
    to access.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than prices
    included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar
    assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
    identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are
    not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
    corroborated with observable market data.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain
    pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar
    techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

The Company’s’ derivative contracts are the only
    assets or liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair
    value using the SFAS 157 hierarchy. The derivative
    contracts use the Level 2 hierarchy and are recorded in
    “Other assets” and in “Accounts payable, accrued
    expenses and other liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet for $62,000 and $11.0 million, respectively as of
    December 31, 2008.

Contingencies

Series C
    Out-Performance Program

In May 2005, the stockholders of UDR approved a new
    Out-Performance Program and the first series of new
    Out-Performance Partnership Shares under the program are the
    Series C Out-Performance Units (the “Series C
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers and
    other key employees of UDR (the “Series C
    Participants”) were given the opportunity to invest
    indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests in UDR Out-Performance
    III, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
    “Series C LLC”), the only asset of which is a
    special class of partnership units of the Operating Partnership
    (“Series C Out-Performance Partnership Shares” or
    “Series C OPPSs”). The purchase price for the
    Series C OPPSs was determined by the Compensation Committee
    of UDR’s Board of Directors to be $750,000, assuming 100%
    participation, and was based upon the advice of an independent
    valuation expert. UDR’s performance for the Series C
    Program was measured over the

36-month

period from June 1, 2005 to May 30, 2008.

The Series C Program was designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period is at least the
    equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized
    (“Minimum Return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if UDR’s
    cumulative total return satisfies these criteria, the
    Series C LLC as holder of the Series C OPPSs will
    receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series C
    Participants as holders of interests in the Series C
    LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from
    the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and
    allocations that would be received on the number of
    OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of UDR’s common stock over the measurement period
    exceeds the Minimum Return (such excess being the “Excess
    Return”);



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ii. multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by UDR’s
    market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares
    outstanding over the

36-month

period, including common stock, common stock equivalents and

iii. dividing the number obtained in clause (ii) by
    the market value of one share of UDR’s common stock on the
    valuation date, computed as the volume-weighted average price
    per day of common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
    preceding the valuation date.

For the Series C OPPSs, the number determined pursuant to
    (ii) above is capped at 1% of market capitalization.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of
    UDR’s common stock does not meet the Minimum Return, then
    the Series C Participants will forfeit their entire initial
    investment.

At the conclusion of the measurement period, May 30, 2008,
    the total cumulative return on UDR’s common stock did not
    meet the minimum return threshold. As a result, there were no
    payouts under the Series C OPPSs program and the investment
    in the amount of $532,500 made by the holders of the
    Series C OPPSs was forfeited.

Series D
    Out-Performance Program

In February 2006, the Board of Directors of UDR approved the
    Series D Out-Performance Program (the “Series D
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers of
    UDR (the “Series D Participants”) were given the
    opportunity to invest indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests
    in UDR Out-Performance IV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
    company (the “Series D LLC”), the only asset of
    which is a special class of partnership units of the Operating
    Partnership (“Series D Out-Performance Partnership
    Shares” or “Series D OPPSs”). The
    Series D Program is part of the New Out-Performance Program
    approved by UDR’s stockholders in May 2005. The
    Series D LLC has agreed to sell 830,000 membership units
    unadjusted for the Special Dividend to certain members of
    UDR’s senior management at a price of $1.00 per unit. The
    aggregate purchase price of $830,000 for the Series D
    OPPSs, assuming 100% participation, is based upon the advice of
    an independent valuation expert. The Series D Program
    measured the cumulative total return on our common stock over
    the

36-month

period beginning January 1, 2006 and ending
    December 31, 2008.

The Series D Program is designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period is at least the
    equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized
    (“Minimum Return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if UDR’s
    cumulative total return satisfies these criteria, the
    Series D LLC as holder of the Series D OPPSs will
    receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series D
    Participants as holders of interests in the Series D
    LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from
    the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and
    allocations that would be received on the number of
    OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of UDR’s common stock over the measurement period
    exceeds the Minimum Return (such excess being the “Excess
    Return”);

ii. multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by UDR’s
    market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares
    outstanding over the

36-month

period, including common stock, OP Units, common stock
    equivalents and OP Units); and

iii. dividing the number obtained in (ii) by the
    market value of one share of UDR’s common stock on the
    valuation date, computed as the volume-weighted average price
    per day of the common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
    preceding the valuation date.



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For the Series D OPPSs, the number determined pursuant to
    clause (ii) above is capped at 1% of market capitalization.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of
    UDR’s common stock does not meet the Minimum Return, then
    the Series D Participants will forfeit their entire initial
    investment.

At the conclusion of the measurement period, December 31,
    2008, the total cumulative return on UDR’s common stock did
    not meet the minimum return threshold. As a result, there were
    no payouts under the Series D OPPSs program and the
    investment in the amount of $443,267 made by the holders of the
    Series D OPPSs was forfeited.

Series E
    Out-Performance Program

In February 2007, the Board of Directors of UDR approved the
    Series E Out-Performance Program (the “Series E
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers of
    UDR (the “Series E Participants”) were given the
    opportunity to invest indirectly in UDR by purchasing interests
    in UDR Out-Performance V, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
    company (the “Series E LLC”), the only asset of
    which is a special class of partnership units of the Operating
    Partnership (“Series E Out-Performance Partnership
    Shares” or “Series E OPPSs”). The
    Series E Program is part of the New Out-Performance Program
    approved by UDR’s stockholders in May 2005. The
    Series E LLC has agreed to sell 805,000 membership units
    unadjusted for the Special Dividend to certain members of
    UDR’s senior management at a price of $1.00 per unit. The
    aggregate purchase price of $805,000 for the Series E
    OPPSs, assuming 100% participation, is based upon the advice of
    an independent valuation expert. The Series E Program will
    measure the cumulative total return on our common stock over the

36-month

period beginning January 1, 2007 and ending
    December 31, 2009.

The Series E Program is designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period is at least the
    equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized
    (“Minimum Return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if UDR’s
    cumulative total return satisfies these criteria, the
    Series E LLC as holder of the Series E OPPSs will
    receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series E
    Participants as holders of interests in the Series E
    LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from
    the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and
    allocations that would be received on the number of
    OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of UDR’s common stock over the measurement period
    exceeds the Minimum Return (such excess being the “Excess
    Return”);

ii. multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by UDR’s
    market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares
    outstanding over the

36-month

period, including common stock, OP Units, common stock
    equivalents and OP Units); and

iii. dividing the number obtained in (ii) by the
    market value of one share of UDR’s common stock on the
    valuation date, computed as the volume-weighted average price
    per day of the common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
    preceding the valuation date.

For the Series E OPPSs, the number determined pursuant to
    clause (ii) above is capped at 0.5% of market
    capitalization.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of
    UDR’s common stock does not meet the Minimum Return, then
    the Series E Participants will forfeit their entire initial
    investment.

Based on the results through December 31, 2008, no
    Series E OPPSs would have been issued had the Program
    terminated on that date. However, since the ultimate
    determination of Series E OPPSs to be issued



UDR,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

will not occur until December 31, 2009, and the number of
    Series E OPPSs is determinable only upon future events, the
    financial statements do not reflect any impact for these events.
    Accordingly, the contingently issuable Series E OPPSs will
    only be included in basic earnings per share after the
    measurement period has ended and the applicable hurdle has been
    met. Furthermore, the Series E OPPSs will only be included
    in common stock and common stock equivalents in the calculation
    of diluted earnings per share after the hurdle has been met at
    the end of the reporting period (if any), assuming the
    measurement period ended at the end of the reporting period.

Litigation
    and Legal Matters

UDR is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising
    in the ordinary course of business. UDR cannot determine the
    ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and
    claims at this time. UDR believes that such liability, to the
    extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, will not
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flow.

REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

FASB Statement No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of
    an Enterprise and Related Information,”
    (FAS 131”), requires that segment disclosures present
    the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker to
    decide how to allocate resources and for purposes of assessing
    such segments’ performance. UDR’s chief operating
    decision maker is comprised of several members of its executive
    management team who use several generally accepted industry
    financial measures to assess the performance of the business for
    our reportable operating segments.

UDR owns and operates multifamily apartment communities
    throughout the United States that generate rental and other
    property related income through the leasing of apartment homes
    to a diverse base of tenants. The primary financial measures for
    UDR’s apartment communities are rental income and net
    operating income (“NOI”). Rental income represents
    gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss
    and bad debt. NOI is defined as total revenues less direct
    property operating expenses. UDR’s chief operating decision
    maker utilizes NOI as the key measure of segment profit or loss.

UDR’s two reportable segments are same communities and
    non-mature/other communities:

•

Same communities

represent those communities acquired,
    developed, and stabilized prior to January 1, 2007, and
    held as of December 31, 2008. A comparison of operating
    results from the prior year is meaningful as these communities
    were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses
    as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to
    conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community
    is not held for disposition within the current year. A community
    is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90%
    occupancy for at least three consecutive months.

•

Non-mature/other communities

represent those communities
    that were acquired or developed in 2006, 2007 or 2008, sold
    properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as
    real estate held for disposition, condominium conversion
    properties, joint venture properties, properties managed by
    third parties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use
    properties.

Management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment
    communities on a same community and non-mature/other basis, as
    well as individually and geographically. This is consistent with
    the aggregation criteria of FAS 131 as each of our
    apartment communities generally has similar economic
    characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore,
    the Company’s reportable segments have been aggregated by
    geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to the
    chief operating decision maker.

All revenues are from external customers and no single tenant or
    related group of tenants contributed 10% or more of UDR’s
    total revenues during the three years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007, or 2006.

RESTRUCTURING
    CHARGES

As of December 31, 2008, UDR restructured our operations
    resulting in a severance related charge of $912,000 reported in
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item
    “Severance costs and other restructuring charges”. The
    Company incurred this charge as a result of the restructuring
    and consolidating 24 positions as we continue to focus on
    obtaining efficiencies.

As of December 31, 2007, UDR has established Highlands
    Ranch, Colorado, as its corporate headquarters and realigned
    resources to improve efficiencies and centralize job functions
    in fewer locations. As a result of a
