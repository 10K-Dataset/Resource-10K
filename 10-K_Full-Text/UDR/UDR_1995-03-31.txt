                                   Part I

Item 1.   Business

     United  Dominion Realty  Trust,  Inc.  (the "Trust"),  a Virginia
corporation,  is a  self-administered equity  real estate investment
trust ("REIT"),  formed  in  1972, whose  business  is devoted  to one
industry segment,  the  ownership and  operation  of income-producing
real  estate, primarily  apartment communities  in the Southeast. The
Trust is  a fully integrated  real estate  company with  acquisition,
construction  and management  capabilities. The Trust  acquires,
upgrades and  operates its properties with the goals of maximizing its
funds from  operations ("FFO") (defined as income before  gains [losses]
on investments  and extraordinary items  adjusted for  certain non-cash
items,  primarily real  estate depreciation) and  quarterly
distributions to shareholders,  while building equity primarily  through
real  estate  appreciation. Prior  to  1991, the Trust's investment
policy was to emphasize the acquisition of under-leased, under-managed,
and/or under-maintained properties that could be physically or otherwise
upgraded and  could be acquired at significant  discounts from
replacement costs.  At  the beginning of 1991, changed  economic
conditions and  the  Trust's  financial strength enabled  it  to  embark
on a  major expansion of its apartment portfolio by taking advantage of
unique buying opportunities  resulting from the  real estate  credit
crisis. This has enabled  the Trust to (i)  acquire more stable
apartment properties having high occupancy levels  and not requiring
substantial renovation, and  (ii) enter  into new  markets including the
Baltimore/Washington area,  central and south Florida, and  Nashville
and  Memphis, Tennessee. During  1994, the Trust also made  acquisitions
for the  first time in Delaware  and Alabama. The properties have been
acquired generally at significant discounts  from replacement  cost and
at current  yields believed  to be attractive. The sellers have
included financially  distressed real  estate limited partnerships, the
RTC, the  FDIC, lenders who had foreclosed  and insurance companies
seeking to reduce their real estate exposure.  During the three years
prior to  1994, the  Trust purchased  36 apartment  communities with
9,237 units for approximately $250  million.  In 1994, the  Trust
purchased 47 apartment communities with 11,433  units for approximately
$404  million. This includes 26 apartment communities with 5,318 units
acquired in a  portfolio purchase for $171 million, including closing
costs. One of the portfolio properties containing 65 units at a cost of
$1.6 million was subsequently resold. As  of  March  28, 1995,  the
Trust's  portfolio  of income-producing  real estate  consisted  of 138
properties including 121 apartment complexes, 13  shopping centers,  and
4 other  properties. (See Item 2. "Properties".)

   The Trust  is operated so  as to qualify  as a real  estate
investment trust under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the  "Code").  To  qualify, the Trust  must
meet certain  tests which, among other  things, require  that its assets
consist primarily  of real estate, its income be derived primarily from
real estate, and at least 95% of its taxable income be distributed to
its shareholders. Because the Trust qualifies  as a REIT, it  is
generally not subject  to Federal income taxes.

   The Trust manages its properties directly, rather than through
outside property  management firms. During  1994, the  cost of internal
property management of the  Trust's apartment properties  was
approximately 3.5%  of rents  collected versus the 4-5%  fee typically
charged  by independent fee management companies in the  Trust's region.
In determining its  cost, the Trust  considers all direct and indirect
costs associated with the internal property management function.

   Near  the end  of 1992,  management of  the Trust determined  that
the Trust should devote  substantially all  of its resources  to the
apartment business.  During 1994, the  Trust sold one shopping center
and as of March 28, 1995,  the Trust was  actively negotiating  the sale
of four  shopping centers (Glen Lea, Hanover Village, Laburnum Park and
Laburnum Square) in a single  transaction. In  addition, the  Trust
entered into  separate and unrelated  contracts to sell an industrial
park, shopping center and vacant land at another shopping center for a
total of $3.5 million.  There is  no assurance that these sales
transactions will be consummated. Although no formal  plans  for
divestiture have  been  made,  the  Trust plans  to substantially
liquidate its commercial properties as opportunities arise.

   A  significant aspect of the  Trust's investment strategy  has been
to concentrate its investments within the Southeast.  The Trust
currently owns properties  in the  seven  coastal states  from  Delaware
to  Florida  plus Tennessee and Alabama. This  strategy of
geographically  focusing on  one region,  has enabled management to
regularly inspect each  property and to monitor  developments in  local
real  estate markets. Over the  past few years,  the  Trust  has entered
several  new  markets within this  region including, Washington, D.C.;
Greensboro, North Carolina; Greenville/Spartanburg, South Carolina;
Orlando, Tampa,  Clearwater, Melbourne,  Ft. Lauderdale/Miami,  Florida;
Baltimore,  Maryland; Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee;  Alabama; and
Delaware. As of December  31, 1994, the Trust's  real estate  portfolio
was geographically  distributed as  set forth in the table on the
following page.
