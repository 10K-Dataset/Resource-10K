PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

General

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. is a self administered real estate investment trust, or
REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities nationwide. At
December 31, 2005, our apartment portfolio included 259 communities located in 43 markets, with a
total of 74,875 completed apartment homes. In addition, we had five apartment communities under
development.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. To continue to
qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally
require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily
from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than
our net capital gain) to our stockholders. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income
to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders. In 2005, we declared total distributions of $1.20 per share to our stockholders,
which represents our 29th year of consecutive dividend increases to our stockholders.

We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of
incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. Our corporate headquarters is located at 400 East Cary
Street, Richmond, Virginia. Our principal executive offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive,
Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado. As of February 24,
2006, we had 1,900 full-time employees
and 136 part-time employees.

Our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships, Heritage Communities L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership, and United Dominion Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. Unless the
context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the company,” or
“United Dominion” refer collectively to United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

2005 Accomplishments

Business Objectives and Operating Strategies

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment
communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. To
achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:

•

own and operate apartments across a national platform, thus enhancing stability and
predictability of returns to our stockholders,



•

manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling,
and building apartment communities,

•

empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively,

•

measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets, and

•

manage our capital structure to ensure predictability of earnings and dividends.

Acquisitions

During 2005, using the proceeds from our disposition program, as well as equity and debt
offerings, we acquired eight communities with 2,561 apartment homes at a total cost of
approximately $390.9 million, including the assumption of secured debt. In addition, we purchased
one parcel of land for $2.9 million.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

Dispositions

We regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase portfolio profitability. During 2005,
we sold over 6,300 of our slower growing, non-core apartment homes while exiting some markets in an
effort to increase the quality and



performance of our portfolio. Proceeds from the disposition program were used primarily to
reduce debt and fund acquisitions.

Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include:

•

current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset,

•

potential increases in new construction in the market area,

•

areas where the economy is not expected to grow substantially, and

•

markets where we do not intend to establish long-term concentration.

At December 31, 2005, there were four communities with a total of 384 condominiums and two
parcels of land classified as real estate held for disposition. We are in the market for
replacement properties that will correspond with our expected sales activity to prevent dilution to
earnings.

Upgrading and Development Activities

During 2005, we continued to reposition properties in targeted markets where there was an
opportunity to add value and achieve greater than inflationary increases in rents over the long
term. In 2005, we spent $49.3 million on five development projects that are expected to be
completed in 2006 and 2007. Revenue enhancing capital expenditures, including kitchen
and bath renovations, and other extensive interior upgrades totaled $98.6 million or $1,302 per
home for the year ended December 31, 2005. In addition, we spent
$18.7 million on major renovation projects that included major
structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing
buildings and the wiring and/or re-plumbing of an entire building.

The following wholly owned projects were under development as of December 31, 2005:

In addition, we owned four parcels of land held for future development aggregating $20.8

Financing Activities

As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we utilized proceeds from
dispositions, debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing
debt, and acquire apartment communities. The following is a summary of our major financing
activities in 2005:

§

Repaid $133.8 million of secured debt and $70.9 million of unsecured debt, and incurred
$8.5 million in prepayment penalties.



Markets and Competitive Conditions

At December 31, 2005, we owned 259 apartment communities in 43 markets in 16 states. When
comparing fourth quarter 2005 to the same period in the prior year, 84% of the portfolio generated
positive revenue growth and 69% of the portfolio generated positive net operating income growth.
We have a geographically diverse portfolio



and we believe that this diversification increases
investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets
and economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings.

We believe changing demographics will have a significant impact on the apartment industry over
the next two decades. In particular, we believe the annual number of young people entering the
workforce and creating households will be significantly higher over the next 10 to 15 years as
compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past 10 years. The number of single
people and single parent households continues to grow significantly. The immigrant population is
also expected to grow at an accelerated pace. Each of these population segments has a high
propensity to rent.

In
many
of our markets, competition for new residents is intense. Some competing communities
offer features that our communities do not have. Competing communities frequently use concessions
or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are
larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is different
depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. In addition, other real estate
investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. These
competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships,
investment companies and other apartment REITs. This competition could increase prices for
properties of the type that we would likely pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources,
or lower capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and
investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:

Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management, improved expense
control, increased resident retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive plans tied
to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s
strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for
continued operational improvement.

Communities

At December 31, 2005, our apartment portfolio included 259 communities having a total of
74,875 completed apartment homes. In addition, we had five apartment communities under
development. The overall quality of our
portfolio has significantly improved since 2001 with the disposition of non-core apartment
homes and our upgrade and rehabilitation program. The upgrading of the portfolio provides several key benefits
related to portfolio profitability. It enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract
residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of
expenses, such as water and sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. In addition, it
potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home, and therefore increases cash
flow.



Same Communities

For 2005, same community property operating income increased 3.4% or $10.3 million compared to
2004. The increase in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 3.8% or $18.6
million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was partially offset by a 4.4% or
$8.3 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in revenues from rental and other income
was primarily driven by a 2.0% or $10.3 million increase in rental rates, a 20.2% or $2.9 million
decrease in concession expense, a 7.5% or $2.6 million increase in utility reimbursement income and
fee income, a 7.8% or $2.5 million decrease in vacancy loss, and a 15.6% or $0.4 million decrease
in bad debt expense. Physical occupancy increased 0.6% to 94.5%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 4.3% or $2.0 million
increase in real estate taxes, a 3.8% or $1.9 million increase in personnel costs, a 3.8% or $1.1
million increase in utilities expense, a 2.9% or $0.9 million increase in repair and maintenance
costs, a 4.7% or $0.8 million increase in administrative and marketing costs, a 46.7% or $0.7
million increase in incentive compensation, and a 5.4% or $0.5 million increase in insurance costs.

Customers

Our
upgrade and rehabilitation programs enable us to raise rents and
attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are
more likely to accept the transfer of expenses, such as water and
sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident.
We believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in terms of rent
growth, stability of occupancy and investment opportunities.

We believe there will be a significant increase in the number of younger renters over the next
10 to 15 years, and that the immigrant population will remain a significant and growing part of the
renter base. Accordingly, we plan to target some of our incremental investments to communities that
will be attractive to younger households or to the immigrant populations. These communities will
often be located close to where these residents work, shop and play.

Tax Matters

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. To continue to qualify
as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that
our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real
estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net
capital gain) to our stockholders. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally
will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the
extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders. Even if we
continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to
certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

We
may utilize several taxable REIT subsidiaries to engage in activities
that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the
provision of management and other services to third parties and the
conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Taxable
REIT subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular corporations and
therefore are subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

Inflation

Substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which may enable us to
realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Such
short-term leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation, although
as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without
penalty. Short-term leases and relatively consistent demand allow rents, and therefore cash flow
from the portfolio, to provide an attractive hedge against inflation.

Environmental Matters

Various
environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of
our communities. Such environmental laws include those regulating the
existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management
of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices of residents about the
lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks,
and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such
requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action
and/or claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not
had a material
effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have a property management plan for hazardous materials. As
part of the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for
each property we own. In addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition.
The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued
report prior to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that our
environmental



assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material
environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise
economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials
have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not
believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We
believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint
and other hazardous materials, coupled with a conservative posture toward accepting known risk, we
can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to
1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead
based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that
community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable
under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living
at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in
the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have
not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material
non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of
our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable
environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial
condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however,
may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. Also,
if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have
a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability
customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are
also insured, in all material respects, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts
necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each
property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

There are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations, some of which
are beyond our control. The following is a description of important factors that may cause our
actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected
or desired.

Unfavorable Changes in Apartment Market and Economic Conditions Could Adversely Affect
Occupancy Levels and Rental Rates.

Market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in
which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and, therefore, our
profitability. Factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following:

The strength of the United States economy has become increasingly susceptible to global events
and threats of terrorism. At the same time, productivity enhancements and the increased exportation
of labor have resulted in limited job growth despite an improving economy. Continued weakness in
job creation, or any worsening of current economic conditions, generally and in our principal
market areas, could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels, our rental rates and
our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities. This may impair our
ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our stockholders.

New
Acquisitions, Developments and Condominium Projects May Not Achieve Anticipated Results.

We intend to continue to
selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment
criteria and to develop apartment communities for rental operations,
to convert properties into condominiums and to develop condominium
projects. Our acquisition,
development and condominium  activities and their success are subject to the following risks:

•

an acquired community may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our
investment, or a significant exposure related to the acquired property may go
undetected during our due diligence procedures,



•

when we acquire an apartment community, we often invest additional amounts
in it with the intention of increasing profitability. These additional investments may
not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability,

•

new developments may not achieve pro forma rents or occupancy levels, or
problems with construction or local building codes may delay initial occupancy dates
for all or a portion of a development community, and

•

an over supply of condominiums in a given market may cause a decrease in the prices at which we expect to sell
condominium properties.

Possible Difficulty of Selling Apartment Communities Could Limit Operational and Financial
Flexibility.

We periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic
objectives, but market conditions could change and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices
acceptable to us. A weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response
to changing economic conditions. Furthermore, a significant portion of the proceeds from our
overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as
like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, so that any related capital
gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may not have immediate access
to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales. In addition, federal tax laws limit our
ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and this
limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.

Increased Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease Apartment Homes or Increase or Maintain
Rents.

Our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting
residents, including other apartment communities and single-family rental homes, as well as owner
occupied single- and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in a particular area could adversely
affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents.

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and Create Refinancing Risk.

We are
subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating
income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or
could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints.
Sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy
our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a REIT for
federal income tax purposes, and the full limits of our line of
credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our
debt covenants. Additionally, we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our
outstanding debt as it matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any
refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures
to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so.

Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt Service Payments and Distributions to
Stockholders.

If our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet
rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt
securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. The following
factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities:

Expenses associated with our investment in a community, such as debt service, real estate
taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a
reduction in rental income from that



community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of
debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of
foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.

Debt Level May Be Increased.

Our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the
level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our
bank and other credit agreements. We manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt
covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt
at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.

Financing May Not Be Available and Could be Dilutive.

Our ability to execute our business
strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines
of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and
preferred equity. Debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, or on
favorable terms or at all. If we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and
acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be
diluted.

Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our Profitability.

We intend to continue to
develop and construct apartment communities. Development activities may be conducted through
wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. Our
development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:

Construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets, and the costs of upgrading
acquired communities have, in some cases, exceeded our original estimates. We may experience
similar cost increases in the
future. Our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any
increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our Growth.

We may from time to time make
acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. We may be
exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, and we may not be able to operate
successfully in new markets. These risks include, among others:

•

inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies,



•

inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities,

•

inability to hire and retain key personnel, and

•

lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures.

Changing
Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and Adversely Affect Our
Cash Flow and the Market Price of Our
Securities.

We currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates
that vary with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2005,
we had approximately $578 million of variable rate indebtedness
outstanding, which constitutes approximately 18% of our total
outstanding indebtedness as of such date. An increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses to the extent our
variable rate debt is not hedged effectively, and it would increase the
costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt.
Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow
and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. In addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could
adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities.

Limited Investment Opportunities Could Adversely Affect Our Growth

. We expect that other real
estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties.
These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer
partnerships, investment companies and other apartment REITs. This competition could increase
prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue, and our competitors may have greater
resources than we do. As a result, we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable
terms, which could adversely affect our growth.

Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel Could Create Inefficiencies.

To
grow successfully, we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of
apartment communities to a larger number of properties. In addition, we must be able to integrate
new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity. Failures
in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our
investments and our overall profitability.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May Result in Material Charges.

From
time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering
into interest rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the predictability of our
financing costs. Also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit
our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. If the terms
of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that
which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective.
Furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future
involve material charges.

Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could Result in Substantial Costs.

Under
various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of
real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of
currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our
knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former
ownership or operation of the real estate. In addition, we could be held liable to a governmental
authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred
in connection with the contamination. These costs could be substantial, and in many cases
environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. The
presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could
materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property.

We
Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if We Fail to Qualify as a
REIT.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code. Our qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy
numerous requirements, some on an
annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code
provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and
involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our
control. We intend that our current organization and method of
operation enable us to continue to qualify as a
REIT, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. In
addition, U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs and other corporations and the
administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with
retroactive effect. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court
decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or adversely affect our
stockholders.



If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax
(including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable
income at regular corporate rates, and
would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income.
Also, unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under
certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year
in which we first failed to qualify. The additional tax liability
from the failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce or eliminate the
amount of cash available
for investment or distribution to our stockholders. This would likely
have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and
our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we would no longer be required to make
distributions to our stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be
subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

We
May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries, Which are Subject to Certain Tax Risks.

We have established several taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite our
qualification as a REIT, our taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable
income. In addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally
do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. While we will attempt to
ensure that our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not adversely affect our REIT
qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result.
Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain
future gains on real property sales, or our taxable REIT subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to
the extent our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in
nature or are otherwise not respected.

Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty
Tax on Gain Attributable to the Transaction.

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise
dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from
transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the
ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a
100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our
occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. However, whether
property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and
circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that
certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. If the Internal
Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a
prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable
to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on
real property sales. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our
ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be
in Our Stockholders’ Best Interests.

Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third
party to acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to various Maryland laws
which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the
difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders’
best interests. The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business
combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of
our stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior
approval. Any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after
the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders
representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast,
excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also provides
generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that
represents 10% (and certain
higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved
by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote.

Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability of Our Stockholders to Effect a
Change in Control of Our Company May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to Our Stockholders.

One of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or
fewer individuals, including entities specified in the Internal Revenue Code, during the last half
of any taxable year. Our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock
primarily to assist us in complying with this requirement. These restrictions include a provision
that generally limits a person from beneficially owning or constructively owning shares of our
outstanding equity stock in excess of a 9.9% ownership interest, unless our board of directors
exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow
the person to exceed 13% of the value of our



outstanding equity stock. These provisions may have
the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a
change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our
stockholders’ best interests.

Under the terms of our shareholder rights plan, our board of directors can, in effect, prevent
a person or group from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.
Unless our board of directors approves the person’s purchase, after that person acquires more than
15% of our outstanding common stock, all other stockholders will have the right to purchase
securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value. Purchases by other
stockholders would substantially reduce the value and influence of the shares of our common stock
owned by the acquiring person. Our board of directors, however, can prevent the shareholder rights
plan from operating in this manner. This gives our board of directors significant discretion to
approve or disapprove a person’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of
business. We cannot determine the ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and
claims at this time. We believe that such liability, to the extent not provided for through
insurance or otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations or cash flow.

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “UDR.” The
following tables set forth the quarterly high and low sale prices per common share reported on the
NYSE for each quarter of the last two fiscal years. Distribution information for common stock

On
February 24, 2006, the closing sale price of our common stock
was $26.86 per share on the NYSE and there were 6,328 holders of
record of the 134,286,524 outstanding shares of our common
stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax purposes, approximately 53% of the
distributions for each of the four quarters of 2005 represented ordinary income, 18% represented
long-term capital gain, 11% represented unrecaptured section 1250 gain, and 18% represented return
of capital to our stockholders.

We pay regular quarterly distributions to holders of shares of our common stock. Future
distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our actual
funds from operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution
requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and other factors. The annual
distribution payment for calendar year 2005 necessary for us to maintain our status as a REIT was
approximately $0.57 per share. We declared total distributions of $1.20 per share of common stock
for 2005.

Series E Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock has no stated par value and a liquidation
preference of $16.61 per share. Subject to certain adjustments and conditions, each share of the
Series E is convertible at any time and from time to time at the holder’s option into one share of
our common stock. The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis as a
single class in combination with the holders of common stock at any



meeting of our stockholders for the election of directors or for any other purpose on which
the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E has no stated maturity and is not
subject to any sinking fund or any mandatory redemption.

Distributions declared on the Series E in 2005 were $1.33 per share or $0.3322 per quarter.
The Series E is not listed on any exchange. At December 31, 2005 a total of 2,803,812 shares of the
Series E were outstanding.

Series F Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of our Series F Preferred Stock. Our
Series F Preferred Stock may be purchased by holders of our operating partnership units, or OP
Units, described below under “Operating Partnership Units,” at a purchase price of $0.0001 per
share. OP Unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and purchase one share of our Series F
Preferred Stock for each OP Unit held. As of February 24, 2006, we have not issued any shares of
our Series F Preferred Stock. If we issue shares of our Series F Preferred Stock, the holders
thereof will be entitled to one vote for each share of the Series F Preferred Stock they hold,
voting together with the holders of our common stock, on each matter submitted to a vote of
securityholders at a meeting of our stockholders. The Series F Preferred Stock does not entitle
its holders to any other rights, privileges or preferences.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under which holders of our common
stock and our Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock may elect to automatically reinvest
their distributions and make additional cash payments to acquire additional shares of our common
stock. Stockholders who do not participate in the plan continue to receive dividends as declared.
As of February 24, 2006, there were 3,547 participants in the plan.

Operating Partnership Units

From time to time we issue shares of our common stock in exchange for OP Units tendered to our
operating partnerships, United Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage Communities L.P., for redemption
in accordance with the provisions of their respective partnership agreements. At December 31, 2005,
there were 10,177,792 OP Units (of which 1,764,662 are owned by the holders of the Series A OPPS
(see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)) and 338,628 OP Units in
United Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage Communities L.P., respectively, that were owned by
limited partners. The holder of the OP Units has the right to require United Dominion Realty, L.P.
to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the holder in exchange for a cash payment based
on the market value of our common stock at the time of redemption. However, United Dominion Realty,
L.P.’s obligation to pay the cash amount is subject to the prior right of the company to acquire
such OP Units in exchange for either the cash amount or shares of our common stock. Heritage
Communities L.P. OP Units are convertible into common stock in lieu of cash, at our option, once
the holder elects to convert, at an exchange ratio of 1.575 shares for each OP Unit. During 2005,
we issued a total of 99,573 shares of common stock in exchange for OP Units.



Purchases of Equity Securities

On June 3, 1999,
our board of directors authorized the repurchase in open market transactions,
in block transactions, or otherwise, of up to 5.5 million shares of common stock. On December 5,
2000, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional 5.5 million shares of
common stock in open market transactions, in block purchases or otherwise. As of December 31,
2005, we have repurchased a total of 9,526,263 shares of common stock
under this program. We repurchased a total of 1,069,500 shares of our
common stock under this program during
the quarter ended December 31, 2005. In addition, we repurchased 2,110,850 shares of our common stock in December 2005 at an
average purchase price per share of $23.51 in connection with our offering of $250 million
aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% convertible senior notes due 2035. We will not repurchase any additional shares of common stock in connection with the notes offering. Information regarding
the offering of our 4.00% convertible senior notes due 2035 and the repurchase of our common stock

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,”

as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

(b)

Funds from operations, or FFO, is defined as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses)
from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This
definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s definition issued in April 2002. We consider FFO in evaluating property
acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flows as a
measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. For 2005, FFO includes $2.5
million of hurricane related insurance recoveries. For 2004, FFO includes a charge of $5.5 million to cover hurricane related expenses. For 2001, FFO
includes a charge of $8.6 million related to workforce reductions, other severance costs, executive office relocation costs, and the write down of seven
undeveloped land sites along with our investment in an online apartment leasing company. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, distributions to
preferred stockholders exclude $5.7 million and $19.3 million, respectively, related to premiums on preferred stock conversions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through
operating cash flows, the sale or maturity of existing assets, or by the acquisition of additional
funds through capital management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and
effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of
liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and
operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes. We routinely use our unsecured
bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to
arranging for longer-term financing. During the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real
estate have been used for both investing and financing activities.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by
operations and borrowings under credit arrangements. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity
requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the repayment of financing on development
activities, and potential property acquisitions, through long-term secured and unsecured
borrowings, the disposition of properties, and the issuance of additional debt or equity
securities. We believe that our net cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to
meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with
REIT requirements in both the short- and long-term. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for
improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property
operations.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission which
provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt
securities, warrants, purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the
public capital markets. This shelf registration statement replaces our previous $1.5 billion shelf
registration statement. In 2005, we completed various financing activities under our previous $1.5
billion shelf registration statement. These activities are summarized in the section titled
“Financing Activities” that follows. Access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions
at the time of issuance.

Future Capital Needs

Future development expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the sale of
property, with construction loans, through joint ventures and, to a lesser extent, with cash flows
provided by operating activities. Acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be
largely financed through the issuance of equity and debt securities, the issuance of operating
partnership units, the assumption or placement of secured and/or unsecured debt, and by the
reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties.

During 2006, we have approximately $36.6 million of secured debt and $135.2 million of
unsecured debt maturing and we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings under
our secured or unsecured credit facilities, the issuance of new unsecured debt securities or
equity, or from disposition proceeds.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our critical accounting policies are those having the most impact on the reporting of our
financial condition and results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. These
policies include those related to (1) capital expenditures, (2) impairment of long-lived assets,
and (3) real estate investment properties. With respect to these critical accounting policies, we
believe that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces
financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented.

Capital Expenditures

In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we
capitalize those expenditures related to acquiring new assets, materially enhancing the value of an
existing asset, or substantially



extending the useful life of an existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an
existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.

During 2005, $156.1 million or $2,062 per home was spent on capital expenditures for all of
our communities, excluding development and commercial properties. These capital improvements
included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances, other recurring capital
expenditures such as HVAC equipment, roofs, siding, parking lots, and other non-revenue enhancing
capital expenditures, which aggregated $38.8 million or $513 per home. In addition, revenue
enhancing capital expenditures, kitchen and bath upgrades, and other extensive interior upgrades
totaled $98.6 million or $1,302 per home, and major renovations totaled $18.7 million or $247 per
home for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of
our communities, excluding real estate under development and commercial properties for the periods
presented:

Total capital improvements increased $73.9 million or $990 per home for the year ended
December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. This increase was attributable to $18.7
million of major renovations at certain of our properties. These renovations included the
re-wiring and/or re-plumbing of an entire building as well as major structural changes and/or
architectural revisions to existing buildings. The increase was also attributable to an additional
$52.7 million being invested in revenue enhancing improvements. We will continue to selectively
add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment
substantially in excess of our cost of capital. Recurring capital expenditures during 2006 are
currently expected to be approximately $530 per home.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and
circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated
to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book
value of those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to
reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding
periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value. Our estimates of
fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market
rates and transactions.

Real Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and allocate the purchase
price to various components, such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, “Business Combinations.” The purchase price is allocated
based on the relative fair value of each component. The fair value of buildings is determined as
if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As
such, the determination of fair value considers the present value of all



cash flows
expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease-up period.
We determine the fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining
term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In addition, we
consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up
period, and the carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. The fair value of in-place
leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual lease
period.

Statements of Cash Flow

The following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and
net cash used in investing and financing activities that are presented in our Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.

Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2005, our net cash flow provided by operating activities was
$248.2 million compared to $251.7 million for 2004. During 2005, the slight decrease in cash flow
from operating activities resulted primarily from a $47.2 million increase in interest expense that
was primarily offset by a $9.1 million net increase in operating
assets/liabilities for the period, and a $32.6 million increase in property operating
results from our apartment community portfolio (see discussion under “Apartment Community
Operations”).

Investing Activities

For
the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities was $219.0 million
compared to $596.0 million for 2004. Changes in the level of investing activities from period to
period reflects our strategy as it relates to our acquisition, capital expenditure, development,
and disposition programs, as well as the impact of the capital market environment on these
activities, all of which are discussed in further detail below.

Acquisitions

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we acquired eight apartment communities with 2,561
apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of $390.9 million and one parcel of land for $2.9
million. For 2004, we acquired 28 apartment communities with 8,060 apartment homes for an aggregate
consideration of $390.9 million and one parcel of land for $16.3 million. Our long-term strategic
plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets.
As a result, we have been expanding our interests in the fast growing Southern California,
Florida, and Metropolitan Washington DC markets over the past two years. During 2006, we plan to
continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will provide the best investment
returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including past performance, expected
job growth, current and anticipated housing supply and demand, and the ability to attract and
support household formation.

Real Estate Under Development

Development activity is focused in core markets in which we have strong operations in place.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, we invested approximately $49.3 million in development
projects, an increase of $30.2 million from our 2004 level of $19.1 million.

The following projects were under development as of December 31, 2005:

Disposition of Investments

For the year ended December 31, 2005, United Dominion sold 22 communities with 6,352 apartment
homes and 240 condominiums from five communities with a total of 648 condominiums for a gross
consideration of $456.3 million. In addition, we sold our
investment in an unconsolidated joint venture for $39.2 million and one parcel of land for $0.9 million. We
recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of $143.5 million on these sales. Proceeds from
the sales were used primarily to reduce debt and acquire additional communities. In connection
with our third quarter portfolio sale of ten communities in Texas and North Carolina, we received
short-term notes of $124.7 million. These notes had maturities ranging from September 2005 to July
2006. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on these notes was $59.8 million, bearing
interest at 6.75%.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold 19 communities with 5,425 apartment homes for an
aggregate consideration of $270.1 million. In addition, we sold 24 of 36 townhomes of a community
for $7.3 million. We recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of $52.9 million on these
sales. Proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt.

During 2006, we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where long-term
growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital into markets that would enhance future growth
rates and economies of scale. We intend to use the proceeds from 2006 dispositions to reduce debt,
acquire communities, and fund development activity.

Financing Activities

Net
cash used in financing activities during 2005 was $21.5 million compared to net cash
provided by financing activities of $347.3 million in 2004. As part of the plan to improve our
balance sheet, we utilized proceeds from dispositions, equity and debt offerings, and refinancings
to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, and purchase new properties.

The following is a summary of our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005:

§

Repaid $133.8 million of secured debt and $70.9 million of unsecured debt, and incurred $8.5 million in prepayment
penalties.

§

Sold $50 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due January 2015 in February 2005 under our
medium-term note program. These notes represent a re-opening of the 5.25% senior unsecured



Credit Facilities

We have four secured revolving credit facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment
of $860 million. As of December 31, 2005, $656.3 million was outstanding under the Fannie Mae
credit facilities leaving $203.7 million of unused capacity. The Fannie Mae credit facilities are
for an initial term of ten years, bear interest at floating and fixed rates, and can be extended
for an additional five years at our discretion. We have $363.9 million of the funded balance fixed
at a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%. The remaining balance on these
facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 4.7%.



We have a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in May 2008 and, at
our option, can be extended an additional year. We have the right to increase the credit facility
to $750 million under certain circumstances. Based on our current credit ratings, the credit
facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 57.5 basis points. As of December 31, 2005,
$210.8 million was outstanding under the credit facility leaving $289.2 million of unused capacity.

The Fannie Mae credit facility and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary
financial covenants and limitations.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing
debt that has to be refinanced. United Dominion does not hold financial instruments for trading or
other speculative purposes, but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio
of real estate assets. Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market
interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings
are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and
maturing fixed rate debt. A large portion of our market risk is exposure to short-term interest
rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under our Fannie Mae credit facility and our bank
revolving credit facility, which totaled $292.5 million and $210.8 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2005. The impact on our financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that
matured during 2005 was immaterial.

If market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100 basis points more in 2006 than
they did during 2005, our interest expense would increase, and income before taxes would decrease
by $6.0 million. Comparatively, if market interest rates for variable rate debt had averaged 100
basis points more in 2005 than in 2004, our interest expense would have increased, and net income
would have decreased by $7.4 million. If market rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points
higher at December 31, 2005, the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased from $2.6
billion to $2.4 billion. If market interest rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points lower
at December 31, 2005, the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from $2.6 billion to
$2.7 billion.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our
borrowing cost. These analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall
economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of
such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the
change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their
possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.

Funds from Operations

Funds from operations, or FFO, is defined as net income (computed in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property,
plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the
recommendations set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s (“NAREIT”)
April 1, 2002 White Paper. We consider FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating
performance, and believe that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to,
net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash
available to fund cash needs.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes
predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with
market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of
operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient
by themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance
and defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United
States), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and
amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The use of
FFO, combined with the required presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial, improving the
understanding of operating results of REITs among



the investing public and making comparisons of
REIT operating results more meaningful. We generally consider FFO to be a useful measure for
reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in
conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance) because by excluding
gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and
excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO can help one compare the operating
performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. We
believe that FFO is the best measure of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts.

The following table outlines our FFO calculation and reconciliation to generally accepted
accounting principles for the three years ended December 31, 2005 (

In the computation of diluted FFO, OP Units, out-performance partnership shares, and the
shares of Series D Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock and Series E Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive; therefore, they are included in the diluted share count.
For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, distributions to preferred stockholders exclude
$5.7 million and $19.3 million, respectively, related to premiums on preferred stock conversions.

Net incremental gains on the sale of condominium homes and the net incremental gain on the
sale of a depreciable asset related to an unconsolidated entity are defined as net sales proceeds
less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation.
We consider FFO with gains/losses on the sale of condominium homes and gains/losses on the sale of
depreciable assets related to an unconsolidated entity to be a meaningful supplemental measure of
performance because the short-term use of funds produce a profit that differs from the traditional
long-term investment in real estate for REITs.

FFO also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and therefore should not be considered an alternative to

Results of Operations

The following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations
for the periods presented.

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

2005-vs.-2004

Net
income available to common stockholders was $139.8 million ($1.02 per diluted share) for
the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $71.9 million ($0.56 per diluted share) for the year
ended December 31, 2004, representing an increase of
$67.9 million ($0.46 per diluted share). The
increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, when compared to the same period in 2004, resulted
primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within
this Report:

•

$90.6 million
more in gains recognized from the sale of depreciable property and an
unconsolidated joint venture in 2005,

•

a
$32.6 million increase in apartment community operating results
in 2005,

•

a $14.2 million increase in non-property income in 2005,



•

a $5.7 million decrease in premiums paid on preferred stock conversions in 2005,

•

a $5.5 million charge recorded for hurricane related expenses in 2004,

•

$4.2 million less in preferred stock distributions in 2005, and

•

$2.5 million in hurricane related insurance recoveries in 2005.

These increases in income were partially offset by a $38.7 million increase in interest
expense, a $31.8 million increase in real estate depreciation and amortization expense, an $8.5
million increase in losses on early debt retirement, and a $5.5 million increase in general and
administrative expense in 2005 when compared to 2004.

2004-vs.-2003

Net income available to common stockholders was $71.9 million ($0.56 per diluted share) for
the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $24.8 million ($0.22 per diluted share) for the year
ended December 31, 2003, representing an increase of $47.1 million ($0.34 per diluted share). The
increase for the year ended December 31, 2004, when compared to the same period in 2003, resulted
primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within
this Report:

These increases in income were partially offset by a $17.2 million increase in depreciation
and amortization expense, a $6.6 million increase in interest expense, and a charge of $5.5 million
for hurricane related expenses in 2004 when compared to 2003.

Same Communities

Our same communities (those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to September
30, 2004 and held on December 31, 2005, which consisted of 58,840 apartment homes) provided 73% of
our property operating income for the year ended December 31, 2005.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, same community property operating income increased 3.4%
or $10.3 million compared to 2004. The increase in property operating income was primarily
attributable to a 3.8% or $18.6 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was
partially offset by a 4.4% or $8.3 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in
revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 2.0% or $10.3 million increase in
rental rates, a 20.2% or $2.9 million decrease in concession expense, a 7.5% or $2.6 million
increase in utility reimbursement income and fee income, a 7.8% or $2.5 million decrease in vacancy
loss, and a 15.6% or $0.4 million decrease in bad debt expense. Physical occupancy increased 0.6%
to 94.5%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 4.3% or $2.0 million
increase in real estate taxes, a 3.8% or $1.9 million increase in personnel costs, a 3.8% or $1.1
million increase in utilities expense, a 2.9% or $0.9 million increase in repair and maintenance
costs, a 4.7% or $0.8 million increase in administrative and marketing costs, a 46.7% or $0.7
million increase in incentive compensation, and a 5.4% or $0.5 million increase in insurance costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating
expenses, the operating margin (property operating income divided by property rental income)
decreased 0.3% to 61.5%.

Non-Mature Communities

The remaining 27% of our property operating income during 2005 was generated from communities
that we classify as “non-mature communities” (primarily those communities acquired or developed in
2003, 2004 and 2005, sold properties, and those properties classified as real estate held for
disposition). The 41 communities with 12,458 apartment homes that we acquired in the fourth quarter
of 2003, and in 2004 and 2005, provided $87.5 million of property operating income. The 22
communities with 6,352 apartment homes and 240 condominiums sold during 2005 provided $10.0 million
of property operating income. In addition, our development communities, which included 244
apartment homes constructed since January 1, 2003, provided $0.7 million of property operating
income during 2005, the four communities with a total of 384 condominiums classified as real estate
held for disposition provided $0.3 million of property operating income, and other non-mature
communities which includes homes that are undergoing major
rehabilitation, provided $17.5



million of property operating income for the year ended December 31,
2005.

2004-vs.-2003

Same Communities

Our same communities (those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to December
31, 2003 and held on December 31, 2004, which consisted of 62,497 apartment homes) provided 78% of
our property operating income for the year ended December 31, 2004.

For 2004, same community property operating income decreased 1.2% or $3.9 million compared to
2003. The overall decrease in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 0.5% or
$2.3 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was offset by a 3.2% or $6.2
million increase in operating expenses. The increase in revenues from rental and other income was
primarily driven by a 7.7% or $2.8 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 14.3% or $2.1 million
increase in utility reimbursement income. These increases in income were offset by a 0.7% or $3.6
million decrease in rental rates. Physical occupancy increased 0.8% to 93.8%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 5.4% or $2.8 million
increase in personnel costs, a 4.7% or $1.5 million increase in repair and maintenance costs, a
3.5% or $1.1 million increase in
utilities expense, and a 1.6% or $0.8 million increase in property taxes.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating
expenses, the operating margin decreased 1.0% to 61.0%.

Non-Mature Communities

The remaining 22% of our property operating income during 2004 was generated from communities
that we classify as “non-mature communities” (primarily those communities acquired or developed
during 2003 and 2004, sold properties, and those properties classified as real estate held for
disposition). The 39 communities with 11,574 apartment homes that we acquired during 2003 and 2004
provided $45.8 million of property operating income. The 19 communities with 5,425 apartment homes
sold during 2004 provided $14.4 million of property operating income. In addition, our development
communities, which included 178 apartment homes constructed since January 1, 2003, provided $1.0
million of property operating income during 2004, the 12 communities with 2,635 apartment homes
classified as real estate held for disposition provided $11.3 million of property operating income,
and other non-mature communities provided $13.5 million of property operating income for the year
ended December 31, 2004.

Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2005, real estate depreciation and amortization on both
continuing and discontinued operations increased $31.8 million or 17.6% compared to 2004, primarily
due to the significant increase in the per home acquisition cost compared to the existing
portfolio, and other capital expenditures.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, real estate depreciation and amortization on both
continuing and discontinued operations increased $17.2 million or 10.5% compared to 2003, primarily
due to the overall increase in the weighted average number of apartment homes, the significant
increase in the per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio, and other capital
expenditures.

Interest Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2005, interest expense on both continuing and discontinued
operations increased $47.2 million or 38.1% from 2004 primarily due to the issuance of debt and
$8.5 million in prepayment penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the weighted average
amount of debt outstanding increased 30.7% or $697.4 million compared to 2004 and the weighted
average interest rate increased from 5.0% to 5.3% during 2005. The weighted average amount of debt
outstanding during 2005 is higher than 2004 as acquisition costs in 2005 have been funded, in most
part, by the issuance of debt. The increase in the weighted average interest rate during 2005
reflects short-term bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had higher interest rates when
compared



to the prior year.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, interest expense on both continuing and discontinued
operations increased $6.8 million or 5.8% from 2003 primarily due to the issuance of debt. For the
year ended December 31, 2004, the weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased 21.2% or
$435.9 million compared to the prior year. However, this was partially offset by the weighted
average interest rate declining from 5.4% to 5.0% during 2004. The weighted average amount of debt
outstanding during 2004 is higher than 2003 as acquisition costs in 2004 have been funded, in most
part, by the issuance of debt. The decrease in the weighted average interest rate during 2004
reflects our ability to take advantage of lower interest rates through refinancing and the
utilization of variable rate debt.

General and Administrative

For the year ended December 31, 2005, general and administrative expenses increased $5.5
million or 28.5% over 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in personnel and incentive
compensation costs, an operating lease on an airplane, compliance
costs and an operations improvement initiative.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.3
million or 6.4%
over 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in investor relations,
legal and consulting expenses.

Hurricane Related Expenses and Hurricane Related Insurance Recoveries

In 2005, $2.5 million
of hurricane related insurance recoveries were recorded. In 2004, we recognized a $5.5 million
charge to cover expenses associated with the damage in
Florida caused by hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne. United Dominion reported that 25 of its
34 Florida communities were affected by the hurricanes.

Impairment Loss on Real Estate and Investments

In 2003, we recognized a $1.4 million charge for the write-off of our investment in Realeum,
Inc., an unconsolidated development joint venture created to develop web-based solutions for
multifamily property and portfolio management.

Gains
on the Sale of Land, Depreciable Property and an Unconsolidated Joint
Venture

For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recognized gains for financial reporting
purposes of $143.5 million and $52.9 million, respectively. Changes in the level of gains
recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period
to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold.

Premium on Preferred Stock Conversions

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we exercised our right to redeem 2 million shares of our Series
D Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of our redemption notice, the
shares to be redeemed were converted by the holder into 3,076,769 shares of common stock at a price
of $16.25 per share. As a result, we recognized a $5.7 million premium on preferred stock
conversions.

In the second quarter of 2003, we exercised our right to redeem 2 million shares of our Series
D Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of our redemption notice, the
shares to be redeemed were converted by the holder into 3,076,923 shares of common stock at a price
of $16.25 per share. In December 2003, we exercised our right to redeem an additional 4 million
shares of our Series D preferred stock. Upon receipt of our redemption notice, the shares to be
redeemed were converted by the holder into 6,154,000 shares of common stock at a price of $16.25
per share. As a result, we recognized a $19.3 million premium on preferred stock conversions
during 2003.



The premium amount recognized to convert these shares represents the cumulative accretion to
date between the conversion value of the preferred stock and the value at which it was recorded at
the time of issuance.

eBay Purchase of Rent.com

On December 16, 2004, eBay announced that it had agreed to acquire privately held Rent.com, a
leading Internet listing web site in the apartment and rental housing industry, for approximately
$415 million plus acquisition costs, net of Rent.com’s cash on hand. On February 23, 2005, eBay
announced that it had completed the acquisition. We owned shares in Rent.com, and as a result of the
transaction, we recorded a one-time pre-tax gain of $12.3 million on the sale.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial.
Substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our
risk from the adverse effects of inflation.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have,
a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2005, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and
procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in
our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in
our periodic SEC reports. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
concluded that during the quarter ended December 31, 2005, there has been no change in our internal
control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of our financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how
remote. However, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief



Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective under circumstances where our disclosure controls
and procedures should reasonably be expected to operate effectively.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

United Dominion’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the

and Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO).

Based on United Dominion’s evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been
audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting

Board of Directors and Stockholders

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting included at Item 9A, that United Dominion Realty Trust,
Inc. (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 of United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and our
report dated February 17, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Stockholders

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. at December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 17, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2005

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and formation

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was formed in 1972. United
Dominion operates within one defined business segment with activities related to the ownership,
management, development, acquisition, renovation, and disposition of multifamily apartment
communities nationwide. At December 31, 2005, United Dominion owned 259 communities with 74,875
completed apartment homes and had five communities with 1,335 apartment homes under development.

Basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of United Dominion and
its subsidiaries, including United Dominion Realty, L.P., (the “Operating Partnership”), and
Heritage Communities L.P. (the “Heritage OP”), (collectively, “United Dominion”). As of December
31, 2005, there were 166,300,080 units in the Operating Partnership outstanding, of which
156,122,288 units or 93.9% were owned by United Dominion and 10,177,792 units or 6.1% were owned by
limited partners (of which 1,764,662 are owned by the holders of the
Series A OPPS, see below). As of December 31, 2005, there were 5,542,200 units in the Heritage OP outstanding, of which
5,203,572 units or 93.9% were owned by United Dominion and 338,628 units or 6.1% were owned by
limited partners. The consolidated financial statements of United Dominion include the minority
interests of the unitholders in the Operating Partnership and the Heritage OP. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid could differ from those
estimates. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
financial statement presentation.

Real estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any recorded impairment losses.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition and/or
improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives if the value of the existing asset will be materially enhanced or the life of the
related asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life expectancy.

United Dominion recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when
there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of an asset
and the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the asset’s carrying value.
Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of
future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. If such indicators of
impairment are present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount
of the asset over its fair value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate
based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

United Dominion purchases real estate investment properties from time to time and allocates
the purchase price to various components, such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to
in-place leases in accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, “Business Combinations.” The purchase
price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component. The fair value of buildings
is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market
rental rates. As such, the determination of fair value considers the present value of all



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2005

cash
flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease up period. United
Dominion determines the fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and
remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. The fair
value of in-place leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining
contractual lease period. United Dominion determines the fair value of in-place leases by
considering the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up
period, and the carrying costs associated with the lease-up period.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are recognized when the fair value
of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties
classified as real estate held for disposition generally represent properties that are under
contract for sale. Real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of cost, net of
accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less the cost to dispose, determined on an asset-by-asset
basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for disposition properties
are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements
related to held for disposition properties are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded
on real estate held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets which is 35 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major improvements, and 3 to 10
years for furniture, fixtures, equipment, and other assets. The value of acquired in-place leases
is amortized over the remaining term of each acquired in-place lease.

All development projects and related carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Real estate under development.” As each building in a project is
completed and becomes available for lease-up, the total cost of the building is transferred to real
estate held for investment and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The
cost of development projects includes interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated
development overhead during the construction period.

Interest, real estate taxes, and incremental labor and support costs for personnel working
directly on the development site are capitalized as part of the real estate under development to
the extent that such charges do not cause the carrying value of the asset to exceed its net
realizable value. During 2005, 2004, and 2003, total interest capitalized was $2.8 million, $1.0
million, and $1.8 million, respectively.

Cash equivalents

Cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with maturities of three months or
less when purchased.

Restricted cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance
and replacement reserves, and security deposits.

Deferred financing costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and other external costs incurred to obtain debt
financings and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective
interest method, over a period not to exceed the term of the related debt. Unamortized financing
costs are written-off when debt is retired before its maturity date. During 2005, 2004, and 2003,
amortization expense was $6.5 million, $5.1 million, and $4.7 million, respectively.

Investments in unconsolidated development joint ventures

Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method when
major business decisions require approval by the other partners and United Dominion does not have
control of the assets. Investments are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in
net income (loss) and cash contributions



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2005

and distributions. United Dominion eliminates
intercompany profits on sales of services that are provided to joint ventures. Differences between
the carrying value of investments and the underlying equity in net assets of the investee are due
to capitalized interest on the investment balance and capitalized development and leasing costs
that are recovered by United Dominion through fees during construction.

Revenue recognition

United Dominion’s apartment homes are leased under operating leases with terms generally of
one year or less. Rental income is recognized after it is earned and collectability is reasonably
assured.

Advertising costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations within the line item “Administrative and marketing.” During 2005, 2004, and 2003, total
advertising expense was $11.2 million, $10.5 million, and $10.6 million, respectively.

Interest rate swap agreements

United Dominion accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance with Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 and No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” At December 31, 2005, United Dominion has no derivative financial
instruments reported on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Prior to
their maturity in July 2004, United Dominion’s
derivative financial instruments consisted of interest rate swap agreements that were designated as
cash flow hedges of debt with variable interest rate features, and as qualifying hedges for
financial reporting purposes. For a derivative instrument that qualifies as a cash flow hedge,
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component
of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings during the same period or periods
during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative
instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the
hedged item, if any, is recognized in current earnings during the period of change.

As part of United Dominion’s overall interest rate risk management strategy, we used
derivative financial instruments as a means to artificially fix variable rate debt or to hedge
anticipated financing transactions. United Dominion’s derivative transactions used for interest
rate risk management included various interest rate swaps with indices that related to the pricing
of specific financial instruments of United Dominion. Because of the close correlation between the
hedging instrument and the underlying cash flow exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of
the derivative instruments were generally offset by changes in the cash flow of the underlying
exposures. As a result, United Dominion appropriately controlled the risk so that derivatives used
for interest rate risk management would not have a material unintended effect on consolidated
earnings. United Dominion does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes.

The fair value of United Dominion’s derivative instruments were reported on the balance sheet
at their current fair value. The estimated fair value for our interest rate swaps relied on
prevailing market interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements were designated with all or a
portion of the principal balance and term of a specific debt obligation. Each interest rate swap
involved the periodic exchange of payments over the life of the related agreement. An amount
received or paid on the interest rate swap was recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to the
related interest expense of the outstanding debt based on the accrual method of accounting. The
related amount payable to and receivable from counterparties was included in other liabilities and
other assets, respectively.

When the terms of the underlying transaction were modified, or when the underlying hedged item
ceased to exist, all changes in the fair value of the instrument were marked-to-market with changes
in value included in net income each period until the instrument matured, unless the instrument was
redesignated as a hedge of another transaction. If a derivative instrument was terminated or the
hedging transaction was no longer determined to be effective, amounts held in accumulated other
comprehensive income were reclassified into earnings over the term of the future cash outflows on
the related debt.



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2005

Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in equity during each period except for
those resulting from investments by or distributions to stockholders, is displayed in the
accompanying Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Other
comprehensive income for 2004 and 2003 consisted of unrealized gains
or losses from derivative financial instruments.

Stock-based employee compensation plans

United Dominion adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payments
effective January 1, 2004 using the prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148

,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” Currently, United Dominion
uses the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees
and expects to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model upon the required adoption of
Statement 123(R) on January 1, 2006. Because Statement 123(R) must be applied not only to new
awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date, and
because United Dominion adopted Statement 123 using the prospective transition method (which
applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date), compensation cost for
some previously granted awards that were not recognized under Statement 123 will be recognized
under Statement 123(R). We do not anticipate that the adoption of
Statement 123(R) will have a material impact on our financial
statements.

Minority interests in operating partnerships

Interests in operating partnerships held by limited partners are represented by operating
partnership units (“OP Units”). The operating partnerships’ income is allocated to holders of OP
Units based upon net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of OP
Units outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units outstanding during the period. Capital
contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to minority interests in
accordance with the terms of the individual partnership agreements. OP Units can be exchanged for
cash or shares of United Dominion’s common stock on a one-for-one basis, at the option of United
Dominion. OP Units, as a percentage of total OP Units and shares outstanding, were 5.9% at December
31, 2005, 6.3% at December 31, 2004, and 6.4% at December 31, 2003.

During 2003, we issued 1,617,815 Preferred Operating Partnership Units (“Preferred OP Units”)
totaling $26.9 million as partial consideration for the purchase of four communities. The
Preferred OP Units carry a fixed coupon of 8.0% ($1.33 per share) until such time as the common share dividend is
equal to or exceeds this amount for four consecutive quarters, at which time the Preferred OP Units
will be entitled to receive dividends equivalent to the dividend paid to holders of common stock.

Minority interests in other partnerships

United Dominion has limited partners in certain real estate partnerships acquired in certain
merger transactions. Net income for these partnerships is allocated based upon the percentage
interest owned by these limited partners in each respective real estate partnership.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per common share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based upon
common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive stock options and other potentially dilutive
common stock equivalents. The dilutive effect of stock options and other potentially dilutive
common stock equivalents is determined using the treasury stock method based on United Dominion’s
average stock price.

additional shares of common stock outstanding for the three years ended December 31, 2005, would be
10,324,037, 10,460,639, and 9,690,883 weighted average common shares, respectively. If the Series
A Out-Performance Partnership Shares were converted to common stock, the additional shares of
common stock outstanding for the three years ended December 31, 2005, would be 1,778,251,
1,791,329, and 1,853,204 weighted average common shares, respectively. If the convertible

for the three years ended December 31, 2005, would be 2,803,812, 6,301,821, and 11,636,293 weighted
average common shares, respectively.

Income
taxes

United
Dominion is operated as, and elects to be taxed as, a real estate
investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Generally, a REIT
complies with the provisions of the Code if it meets certain
requirements concerning its income and assets, as well as if it
distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its
stockholders and will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes if
it distributes at least 100% of its income. Accordingly, no provision
has been made for federal income taxes of the REIT. United Dominion
is subject to certain state and local excise or franchise taxes, for
which provision has been made. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any
taxable year, our taxable income will be subject to United States
Federal income tax at regular corporate rates (including any
applicable alternative minimum tax). Even if we qualify as a REIT, we
may be subject to certain state and local income taxes and to United
States Federal income tax. We also will be required to pay a 100% tax
on non-arms length transactions between us and a taxable REIT
subsidiary and on any net income from sales of property that the IRS
successfully asserts was property held for sale to customers in the
ordinary course.

The
differences between net income available to common stockholders for
financial reporting purposes and taxable income before dividend
deductions relate primarily to temporary differences, principally
real estate depreciation and the tax deferral of certain gains on
property sales. The differences in depreciation result from
differences in the book and tax basis of certain real estate assets
and the differences in the methods of depreciation and lives of the
real estate assets.

Impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements

In
March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47,
“Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, Asset Retirement
Obligations” (FIN 47). A conditional asset retirement obligation
refers to a legal obligation to retire assets where the timing and/or
method of settlement are conditioned on future events. FIN 47
requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a
conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the
liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated. We adopted
the provisions of FIN 47 for the year ended December 31,
2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified its consensus in EITF Issue 04-05, “Determining Whether a
General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights” (Issue 04-05). The effective date for Issue
04-05 is June 29, 2005 for all new or modified partnerships and January 1, 2006 for our remaining
partnerships for the applicable provisions. The adoption of the provisions of EITF 04-05 is not
anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

2. REAL ESTATE OWNED

United Dominion operates in 43 markets dispersed throughout 16 states. At December 31, 2005,
our largest apartment market was Southern California, where we owned 19.8% of our apartment homes,
based upon carrying value. Excluding Southern California, United Dominion did not own more than
6.7% of its apartment homes in any one market, based upon carrying value.

In
2005, $2.5 million of hurricane related insurance recoveries
were recorded. In 2004, United Dominion recognized a $5.5 million charge to cover expenses associated with
the damage in Florida caused by hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne. United Dominion reported
that 25 of its 34 Florida communities were affected by the hurricanes.

In 2003, United Dominion recognized a $1.4 million charge for the write-off of its investment
in Realeum, Inc., an unconsolidated development joint venture created to develop web-based
solutions for multifamily property and portfolio management.

3. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

United Dominion adopted FASB Statement No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” (FAS 144) as of January 1, 2002. FAS 144 requires, among other things, that
the primary assets and liabilities and the results of operations of United Dominion’s real
properties which have been sold subsequent to January 1, 2002, or are held for disposition
subsequent to January 1, 2002, be classified as discontinued operations and segregated in United
Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets. Properties classified as real
estate held for disposition generally represent properties that are under contract for sale and are
expected to close within the next twelve months. For purposes of these financial statements, FAS
144 results in the presentation of the primary assets and liabilities and the net operating results
of those properties sold or classified as held for disposition through December 31, 2005, as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. The adoption of FAS 144 does not have an impact
on net income available to common stockholders. FAS 144 only results in the reclassification of
the operating results of all properties sold or classified as held for disposition through December
31, 2005 within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004, and 2003, and the reclassification of the assets and liabilities within the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, United Dominion sold 22 communities with a total of
6,352 apartment homes, 240 condominiums from five communities with a total of 648 condominiums, and
one parcel of land. We recognized gains for financial reporting
purposes of $139.7 million on
these sales. At December 31, 2005, United Dominion had four communities with a total of 384
condominiums and a net book value of $29.1 million, and two

parcels of land with a net book value
of $5.2 million included in real estate held for disposition. In conjunction with the sale of ten
communities in July 2005, we received short-term notes for $124.7 million that bear interest at
6.75% and had maturities ranging from September 2005 to July 2006. As of December 31, 2005, the
balance on the notes receivable was $59.8 million. We recognized gains for financial reporting
purposes of $15.2 million and will recognize $6.4 million
in additional gains in 2006 as the notes
receivable mature and are paid. During 2004, United Dominion sold 19 communities with a total of 5,425
apartment homes, 24 condominiums from a community of 36 condominiums, and one parcel of land.
During 2003, United Dominion sold seven communities with a total of 1,927 apartment homes and two
commercial properties. The results of operations for these properties and the interest expense
associated with the secured debt on these properties are classified on the Consolidated Statements
of Operations in the line item entitled “Income from discontinued operations, net of minority
interests.”

(a)

During the second quarter of 2005, United Dominion amended and restated its $500 million
unsecured revolving credit facility and extended the term an additional two years. The credit
facility matures on May 31, 2008, and at United Dominion’s option, can be extended for an
additional year. United Dominion has the right to increase the credit facility to $750
million if the initial lenders increase their commitments or we receive commitments from
additional lenders. Based on United Dominion’s current credit ratings, the credit facility
carries an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 57.5 basis points, which represents a
12.5 basis point reduction to the previous unsecured revolver, and the facility fee was
reduced from 20 basis points to 15 basis points. Under a competitive bid feature and for so
long as United Dominion maintains an Investment Grade Rating, United Dominion has the right to
bid out 100% of the commitment amount.

(b)

Prior to December 15, 2030, upon the occurrence of
specified events, the notes will be convertible at the option of the
holder into cash and,  in certain circumstances, shares of United
Dominion’s  common stock at an initial conversion rate of
35.2988 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to
an initial conversion price of approximately $28.33 per share).
On or after December 15, 2030, the notes will be convertible at
any time prior to the second business day prior to maturity at the
option of the holder into cash and, in certain circumstances, shares
of United Dominion’s common stock at the above initial conversion
rate. The initial conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances.

option to redeem at any time all or part of the Series D at a price per share of $25, payable in
cash, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, provided that the current market price of our common
stock was at least equal to the conversion price, initially set at $16.25 per share.

In 2004, we exercised our right to redeem the remaining 2 million shares of our Series D that
were outstanding. Upon receipt of our redemption notice, the shares to be redeemed were converted
by the holder into 3,076,769 shares of common stock at a price of $16.25 per share. In 2003, we
exercised our right to redeem 6 million shares of our Series D. Upon receipt of our redemption

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

United Dominion’s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”)
allows common and preferred stockholders the opportunity to purchase, through the reinvestment of
cash dividends, additional shares of United Dominion’s common stock. As of December 31, 2005,
9,849,009 shares of common stock had been issued under the Stock Purchase Plan. Shares in the
amount of 15,150,991 were reserved for further issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan as of December
31, 2005. During 2005, 55,818 shares were issued under the Stock Purchase Plan for a total
consideration of approximately $1.3 million.

Restricted Stock Awards

United Dominion’s 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) authorizes the grant of restricted
stock awards to employees, officers, consultants, and directors of United Dominion. Deferred
compensation expense is recorded over the vesting period and is based upon the value of the common
stock on the date of issuance. For the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized $3.2 million,
$2.7 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, of
compensation expense related to the amortization of restricted stock. As of December 31, 2005, 903,481 shares of restricted stock have
been issued under the LTIP.

Shareholder Rights Plan

United Dominion’s First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement is intended to protect long-term
interests of stockholders in the event of an unsolicited, coercive or unfair attempt to take over
United Dominion. The plan authorized a dividend of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (the
“Rights”) on each share of common stock outstanding. Each Right, which is not currently
exercisable, will entitle the holder to purchase 1/1000 of a share of a

new series of United
Dominion’s preferred stock, to be designated as Series C Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred
Stock, at a price to be determined upon the occurrence of the event, and for which the holder must
be paid $45 should the takeover occur. Under the Plan, the rights will be exercisable if a person
or group acquires more than 15% of United Dominion’s common stock or announces a tender offer that
would result in the ownership of 15% of United Dominion’s common stock.

7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by United
Dominion using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable
judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the
estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts United Dominion would
realize on the disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions
or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The
carrying amounts and estimated fair value of United Dominion’s financial instruments as of December
31, 2005 and 2004, are summarized as follows

The following methods and assumptions were used by United Dominion in estimating fair values.

Cash equivalents

The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Notes receivable

In July 2005, United Dominion received short-term notes in the principal amount of $124.7
million that bear interest at 6.75% and had maturities ranging from September 2005 to July 2006.
The notes were received in conjunction with the sale of ten communities. As of December 31, 2005,
the outstanding balance on these notes was $59.8 million. In June 2003, United Dominion received a
promissory note in the principal amount of $5 million that is due October 2011. The note was
received in connection with one of our acquisitions and bears interest of 9.0% that is payable in
annual installments. The carrying amount of these notes receivable approximate their fair value.

Secured and unsecured debt

Estimated fair value is based on mortgage rates, tax-exempt bond rates, and corporate
unsecured debt rates believed to be available to United Dominion for the issuance of debt with
similar terms and remaining lives. The carrying amount of United Dominion’s variable rate secured
debt approximates fair value as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The carrying amounts of United
Dominion’s borrowings under variable rate unsecured debt arrangements, short-term revolving credit
agreements, and lines of credit approximate their fair values as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Derivative financial instruments

At December 31, 2005, United Dominion has no derivative financial instruments reported on its
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, United Dominion recognized $1.9 million and
$8.1 million, respectively, of unrealized gains in comprehensive income. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, United

For income tax purposes, distributions paid to common stockholders may consist of ordinary income, capital gains,
and non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof. Distributions that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits constitute a return of capital rather than taxable income and reduce
the stockholder’s basis in their common shares. To the extent that a distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder’s basis in the common shares, it generally
will be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder’s common shares. For the three years ended December 31, 2005,
distributions declared per common share were taxable as follows:

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Profit Sharing Plan

The United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan (the “Plan”) is a defined
contribution plan covering all eligible full-time employees. Under the Plan, United Dominion makes
discretionary profit sharing and matching contributions to the Plan as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Aggregate



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2005

provisions for contributions, both matching and discretionary, which are included in United
Dominion’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004,
and 2003 were $0.6 million, $0.6 million, and $0.3 million, respectively.

Stock Option Plan

In May 2001, the stockholders of United Dominion approved the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(the “LTIP”), which supersedes the 1985 Stock Option Plan. With the approval of the LTIP, no
additional grants will be made under the 1985 Stock Option Plan. The LTIP authorizes the granting
of awards which may take the form of options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards, and any other right or
interest relating to common stock or cash. The Board of Directors reserved 4 million shares for
issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards under the LTIP. The LTIP generally provides, among
other things, that options are granted at exercise prices not lower than the market value of the
shares on the date of grant and that options granted must be exercised within ten years. The
maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued subject to incentive stock options is 4
million shares. Shares under options that expire or are cancelable are available for subsequent
grant.

United Dominion adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payments
effective January 1, 2004 using the prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.” Currently, United Dominion
uses the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees
and expects to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model upon the required adoption of
Statement 123(R) on January 1, 2006. Because Statement 123(R) must be applied not only to new
awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date, and
because United Dominion adopted Statement 123 using the prospective transition method (which
applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date), compensation cost for
some previously granted awards that were not recognized under Statement 123 will be recognized
under Statement 123(R). There were no options granted during 2005, 2004 or 2003.

A summary of United Dominion’s stock option activity during the three years ended December 31,
2005 is provided in the following table:

Contingencies

Series B Out-Performance Program

In May 2003, the stockholders of United Dominion approved the Series B Out-Performance Program
(the “Series B Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers of United Dominion (the
“Series B Participants”) were given the opportunity to invest indirectly in United Dominion by
purchasing interests in a limited liability company (the “Series B LLC”), the only asset of which
is a special class of partnership units of United Dominion Realty, L.P. (“Series B Out-Performance
Partnership Shares” or “Series B OPPSs”) . The purchase price for the Series B OPPSs was
determined by United Dominion’s board of directors to be $1 million, assuming 100% participation,
and was based upon the advice of an independent valuation expert. The Series B Program measured
the cumulative total return on our common stock over the 24-month period from June 1, 2003 to May
31, 2005.

The Series B Program was designed to provide participants with the possibility of substantial
returns on their investment if the total cumulative return on United Dominion’s common stock, as
measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share price appreciation during the
measurement period (a) exceeded the cumulative total return of the Morgan Stanley REIT Index peer
group index over the same period; and (b) was at least the



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2005

equivalent of a 22% total return, or 11% annualized.

At the conclusion of the measurement period on May 31, 2005, United Dominion’s total
cumulative return did not satisfy these criteria, and therefore, the Series B LLC as holder of the
Series B OPPSs did not receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series B Participants as holders of
interests in the Series B LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from the Operating
Partnership (accounted for on a consistent basis with all other OP Units) equal to the
distributions and allocations that would be received on the number of OP Units. As a result, the
investment made by the holders of the Series B OPPSs was forfeited.

Series C Out-Performance Program

In May 2005, the stockholders of United Dominion approved the Series C Out-Performance Program
(the “Series C Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers and other key employees of
United Dominion (the “Series C Participants”) were given the opportunity to invest indirectly in
United Dominion by purchasing interests in UDR Out-Performance III, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the “Series C LLC”), the only asset of which is a special class of partnership
units of United Dominion Realty, L.P. (“Series C Out-Performance Partnership Shares” or “Series C
OPPSs”) . The purchase price for the Series C OPPSs was determined by the Compensation Committee
of United Dominion’s board of directors to be $750,000, assuming 100% participation, and was based
upon the advice of an independent valuation expert. The Series C Program will measure the
cumulative total return on our common stock over the 36-month period from June 1, 2005 to May 30,
2008.

The Series C Program is designed to provide participants with the possibility of substantial
returns on their investment if the total cumulative return on United Dominion’s common stock, as
measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share price appreciation during the
measurement period is at least the equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized (“Minimum
Return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if United Dominion’s total cumulative return
satisfies these criteria, the Series C LLC as holder of the Series C OPPSs will receive (for the
indirect benefit of the Series C Participants as holders of interests in the Series C LLC)
distributions and allocations of income and loss from the Operating Partnership equal to the
distributions and allocations that would be received on the number of OP Units obtained by:

i.

determining the amount by which the cumulative total return of United
Dominion’s common stock over the measurement period exceeds the Minimum Return
(such excess being the “Excess Return”);

ii.

multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by United Dominion’s market
capitalization (defined as the average number of shares outstanding over
the 36-month period, including common stock, OP Units, and common stock
equivalents) multiplied by the daily closing price of United Dominion’s common
stock, up to a maximum of 1% of market capitalization; and

iii.

dividing the number obtained in (ii) by the market value of one share
of United Dominion’s common stock on the valuation date, determined by the
volume-weighted average price per day of common stock for the 20 trading days
immediately preceding the valuation date.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of United Dominion’s common stock does
not meet the Minimum Return, then the Series C Participants will forfeit their entire initial
investment.

Litigation and Legal Matters

United Dominion is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary
course of business. United Dominion cannot determine the ultimate liability with respect to such
legal proceedings and claims at this time. United Dominion believes that such liability, to the
extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

11. INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

United Dominion owns and operates multifamily apartment communities throughout the United
States that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment
units to a diverse base of tenants. United Dominion separately evaluates the performance of each
of its apartment communities. However, because each of the apartment communities has similar
economic characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants, the apartment communities have been
aggregated into a single apartment communities segment. All segment disclosure is included in or
