PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. is a self administered real
    estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires,
    renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities
    nationwide. At December 31, 2006, our apartment portfolio
    included 242 communities located in 33 markets, with a total of
    70,339 completed apartment homes. In addition, we had five
    apartment communities under development.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To continue to qualify as
    a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among
    other things, generally require that our assets consist
    primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily
    from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of
    our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to our
    stockholders. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be
    subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level
    on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to
    our stockholders. In 2006, we declared total distributions of
    $1.25 per common share to our stockholders, which represents our
    30th year of consecutive dividend increases to our
    stockholders.

We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003,
    we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland.
    Our corporate headquarters is located at 400 East Cary Street,
    Richmond, Virginia. Our principal executive offices are located
    at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite 200, Highlands Ranch,
    Colorado. As of February 20, 2007, we had
    1,809 full-time employees and 127 part-time employees.

Our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships, Heritage
    Communities L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and United
    Dominion Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. Unless the
    context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to
    “we,” “us,” “our,” “the
    company,” or “UDR” refer collectively to United
    Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

    Accomplishments

•

We increased our common stock dividend for the
    30th consecutive year.

•

We completed over $1.2 billion of capital transactions in
    2006.

•

We authorized a new 10 million share repurchase program
    that replaced our previous 11 million share repurchase
    program.

•

We acquired 2,763 apartment homes in eight communities for
    approximately $327.5 million and two parcels of land for
    $19.9 million.

•

We completed the disposition of 24 apartment communities with
    7,653 apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of
    approximately $444.9 million. In addition, we sold 384
    condominiums within four communities for a total consideration
    of $72.1 million.

Business
    Objectives and Operating Strategies

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic
    returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders
    with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve
    this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following
    goals and strategies:

•

own and operate apartments across a national platform, thus
    enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our
    stockholders,

•

manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to
    buying, selling, and building apartment communities,

•

empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently
    and effectively,



•

measure and reward associates based on specific performance
    targets, and

•

manage our capital structure to ensure predictability of
    earnings and dividends.

Acquisitions

During 2006, using the proceeds from our disposition program, as
    well as debt offerings, we acquired eight communities with 2,763
    apartment homes at a total cost of approximately
    $327.5 million, including the assumption of secured debt.
    In addition, we purchased two parcels of land for
    $19.9 million.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•

research in the following areas: population growth, cost of
    alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and
    the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the
    property is located,

•

geographic location, including proximity to our existing
    communities which can deliver significant economies of scale,

•

construction quality, condition and design of the community,

•

current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability
    to increase cash flow,

•

potential for capital appreciation of the property,

•

ability to increase the value and profitability of the property
    through upgrades and repositioning,

•

terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent
    increases,

•

occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar
    type in the vicinity,

•

prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing
    of the property, and

•

competition from existing multifamily communities and the
    potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in
    the area.

The following table summarizes our apartment acquisitions and
    our year-end ownership position for the past five years

Dispositions

We regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase the
    quality and performance of our portfolio. During 2006, we sold
    over 7,600 of our slower growing, non-core apartment homes while
    exiting some markets in an effort to increase the quality and
    performance of our portfolio. Proceeds from the disposition
    program were used primarily to reduce debt and fund acquisitions.

Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property
    include:

•

current market price for an asset compared to projected
    economics for that asset,

•

potential increases in new construction in the market area,

•

areas where the economy is not expected to grow
    substantially, and

•

markets where we do not intend to establish long-term
    concentration.



At December 31, 2006, we had two communities with a total
    of 475 apartment homes, one community with a total of 320
    condominiums, one commercial unit, and one parcel of land
    classified as real estate held for disposition. We are in the
    market for replacement properties that will correspond with our
    expected sales activity to prevent dilution to earnings.

Upgrading
    and Development Activities

During 2006, we continued to reposition properties in targeted
    markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value
    and achieve greater than inflationary increases in rents over
    the long term. In 2006, we spent $21.6 million on five
    development projects that are expected to be completed in 2007
    and 2008. Revenue enhancing capital expenditures, including
    kitchen and bath renovations, and other extensive interior
    upgrades totaled $144.1 million or $2,002 per home for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, we spent
    $37.0 million on major renovation projects that included
    major structural changes

and/or

architectural revisions to existing buildings and the wiring

and/or

re-plumbing of an entire building.

Financing
    Activities

As part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we
    utilized proceeds from dispositions, debt and equity offerings
    and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt,
    and acquire apartment communities. The following is a summary of
    our major financing activities in 2006:

•

Repaid $70.3 million of secured debt and
    $138.8 million of unsecured debt.

•

Authorized a new 10 million share repurchase program in
    February 2006. This program replaces our previous
    11 million share repurchase program under which we
    repurchased approximately 10 million shares.

•

Sold $125 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.05% senior unsecured notes due June 2013 in June 2006
    under our medium-term note program. The net proceeds of
    approximately $124 million were used for debt repayment.

•

Sold $250 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.625% convertible senior unsecured notes due 2011 in
    October 2006. The net proceeds of approximately
    $245 million were used for the repayment of indebtedness
    under our revolving credit facility, the cost of a capped call
    transaction, and for other general corporate purposes. The
    capped call instrument effectively increased the conversion
    premium to 40%.

Markets
    and Competitive Conditions

At December 31, 2006, we owned 242 apartment communities in
    33 markets in 16 states. When comparing fourth quarter 2006
    to the same period in the prior year, 90% of the portfolio
    generated positive revenue growth and 75% of the portfolio
    generated positive net operating income growth. We have a
    geographically diverse portfolio and we believe that this
    diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases
    the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and
    economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability
    of our earnings.

We believe changing demographics will have a significant impact
    on the apartment industry over the next two decades. In
    particular, we believe the annual number of young people
    entering the workforce and creating households will be
    significantly higher over the next 10 to 15 years as
    compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past
    10 years. The number of single people and single parent
    households continues to grow significantly. The immigrant
    population is also expected to grow at an accelerated pace. Each
    of these population segments has a high propensity to rent.

In many of our markets, competition for new residents is
    intense. Some competing communities offer features that our
    communities do not have. Competing communities can use
    concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive
    advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer
    than our communities. The competitive position of each community
    is different depending upon many factors including

sub-market

supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors
    compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop
    new properties. These competitors include insurance companies,
    pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment
    companies and other apartment REITs. This competition could
    increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely
    pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources, or lower
    capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete
    effectively for residents and investments. We believe our
    competitive advantages include:

•

a fully integrated organization with property management,
    development, acquisition, marketing and financing expertise,

•

scalable operating and support systems,

•

purchasing power,



•

geographic diversification with a presence in 33 markets across
    the country, and

•

significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us
    to be a local operating expert.

Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease
    management, improved expense control, increased resident
    retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive
    plans tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan
    of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in
    targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform,
    should position us for continued operational improvement.

Communities

At December 31, 2006, our apartment portfolio included 242
    communities having a total of 70,339 completed apartment homes.
    In addition, we had five apartment communities under
    development. The overall quality of our portfolio has
    significantly improved since 2001 with the disposition of
    non-core apartment homes and our upgrade and rehabilitation
    program. The upgrading of the portfolio provides several key
    benefits related to portfolio profitability. It enables us to
    raise rents more significantly and to attract residents with
    higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept
    the transfer of expenses, such as water and sewer costs, from
    the landlord to the resident. In addition, it potentially
    reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home, and
    therefore should result in increased cash flow.

Same
    Community Comparison

For 2006, same community property operating income increased
    8.6% or $30.4 million compared to 2005. The increase in
    property operating income was primarily attributable to a 6.0%
    or $34.2 million increase in revenues from rental and other
    income that was offset by a 1.8% or $3.9 million increase
    in operating expenses. The increase in revenues from rental and
    other income was primarily driven by a 4.9% or
    $28.4 million increase in rental rates, a 17.6% or
    $2.2 million decrease in concession expense, and a 12.5% or
    $5.0 million increase in utility reimbursement income and
    fee income. Physical occupancy increased 0.1% to 94.7%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 15.8% or $1.6 million increase in insurance costs, a
    4.4% or $1.5 million increase in utility costs, a 2.8% or
    $1.5 million increase in personnel costs, a 1.1% or
    $0.4 million increase in repair and maintenance expenses,
    and a 0.5% or $0.3 million increase in real estate taxes.
    These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a
    6.0% or $1.2 million decrease in administrative and
    marketing expenses.

Customers

Our upgrade and rehabilitation programs enable us to raise rents
    and attract residents with higher levels of disposable income
    who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses, such as
    water and sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. We
    believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in
    terms of rent growth, stability of occupancy and investment
    opportunities.

We believe there will be a significant increase in the number of
    younger renters over the next 10 to 15 years, and that the
    immigrant population will remain a significant and growing part
    of the renter base. Accordingly, we plan to target some of our
    incremental investments to communities that will be attractive
    to younger households or to the immigrant populations. These
    communities will often be located close to where these residents
    work, shop and play.

Tax
    Matters

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To
    continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain
    tests that, among other things, generally require that our
    assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be
    derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we
    distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than
    net capital gains) to our stockholders. Provided we maintain our
    qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to
    U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on



our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to
    our stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we
    will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local
    taxes on our income and property.

We may utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries to engage in activities
    that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the
    provision of management and other services to third parties and
    the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions.
    Taxable REIT subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular
    corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and
    local income taxes.

Inflation

Substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or
    less, which may enable us to realize increased rents upon
    renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Such
    short-term leases generally minimize the risk to us of the
    adverse effects of inflation, although as a general rule these
    leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term
    without penalty. Short-term leases and relatively consistent
    demand allow rents to provide an attractive hedge against
    inflation.

Environmental
    Matters

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing
    operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include
    those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials
    in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and
    notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active
    underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management
    activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could
    subject us to a government enforcement action

and/or

claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental
    protection regulations has not had a material effect on our
    capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have
    a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of
    the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and
    reports have been completed for each property we acquire. In
    addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to
    acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified
    environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior
    to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it
    is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal
    all environmental liabilities, or that some material
    environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some
    cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive
    acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of
    hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been
    unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. We do not
    believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale
    abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through
    professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos,
    lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a
    relatively conservative posture toward accepting known
    environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential
    liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential
    housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential
    residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint
    hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such
    notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the
    communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in
    that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint
    are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any
    such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by
    children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our
    properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a
    material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.
    We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we
    are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance,
    liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in
    connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that
    the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental
    laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us
    or our financial condition or results of operations. Future
    environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may
    require additional remediation of existing conditions that are
    not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements
    are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could
    have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.



Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our
    communities, with limits of liability customary within the
    industry to insure against liability claims and related defense
    costs. We are also insured, in all material respects, against
    the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to
    reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to
    repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income
    during the reconstruction period.

    Section 303A.12(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual
    regarding our compliance with NYSE corporate governance listing

    Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as
    Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to this Report.

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

There are many factors that affect our business and our results
    of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The
    following is a description of important factors that may cause
    our actual results of operations in future periods to differ
    materially from those currently expected or discussed in
    forward-looking statements set forth in this Report relating to
    our financial results, operations and business prospects. Except
    as required



by law, we undertake no obligation to update any such
    forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
    after the date on which it is made.

Unfavorable Changes in Apartment Market and Economic
    Conditions Could Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels and Rental
    Rates.

Market and economic conditions in the
    metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect
    our occupancy levels and rental rates and, therefore, our
    profitability. Factors that may adversely affect these
    conditions include the following:

•

a reduction in jobs and other local economic downturns,

•

declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing
    more affordable,

•

government or builder incentives which enable first time
    homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative
    housing decisions easier to make,

•

oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes,

•

declines in household formation, and

•

rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating
    rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to
    offset increases in operating costs.

The strength of the United States economy has become
    increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of
    terrorism. At the same time, productivity enhancements and the
    increased exportation of labor have resulted in limited job
    growth despite an improving economy. Continued weakness in job
    creation, or any worsening of current economic conditions,
    generally and in our principal market areas, could have a
    material adverse effect on our occupancy levels, our rental
    rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of
    apartment communities. This may impair our ability to satisfy
    our financial obligations and pay distributions to our
    stockholders.

New Acquisitions, Developments and Condominium Projects May
    Not Achieve Anticipated Results.

We intend to
    continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet
    our investment criteria and to develop apartment communities for
    rental operations, to convert properties into condominiums and
    to develop condominium projects. Our acquisition, development
    and condominium activities and their success are subject to the
    following risks:

•

an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we
    expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure
    related to the acquired property may go undetected during our
    due diligence procedures,

•

when we acquire an apartment community, we often invest
    additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing
    profitability. These additional investments may not produce the
    anticipated improvements in profitability,

•

new developments may not achieve pro forma rents or occupancy
    levels, or problems with construction or local building codes
    may delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a
    development community, and

•

an over supply of condominiums in a given market may cause a
    decrease in the prices at which we expect to sell condominium
    properties.

Possible Difficulty of Selling Apartment Communities Could
    Limit Operational and Financial Flexibility.

We
    periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer
    meet our strategic objectives. Market conditions could change
    and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to
    us. A weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio
    promptly in response to changing economic conditions.
    Furthermore, a significant portion of the proceeds from our
    overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order
    for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under
    Section 1031 of the Code, so that any related capital gain
    can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we
    may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated
    from our property sales. In addition, federal tax laws limit our
    ability to profit on the sale



of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and
    this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when
    market conditions are favorable.

Increased Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease
    Apartment Homes or Increase or Maintain
    Rents.

Our apartment communities compete with
    numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including
    other apartment communities and single-family rental homes, as
    well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes.
    Competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect
    our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain
    rents.

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and
    Create Refinancing Risk.

We are subject to the
    risks normally associated with debt financing, including the
    risk that our operating income and cash flow will be
    insufficient to make required payments of principal and
    interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our
    line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash
    flow may not be available to make all required principal
    payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to
    maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
    and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available
    to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints
    of our debt covenants. Additionally, we are likely to need to
    refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it
    matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the
    terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of
    the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets
    or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose
    to do so.

Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt
    Service Payments and Distributions to
    Stockholders.

If our apartment communities do not
    generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses,
    our ability to make required payments of interest and principal
    on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our
    stockholders will be adversely affected. The following factors,
    among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our
    apartment communities:

•

the national and local economies,

•

local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of
    apartment homes,

•

tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience, and
    attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where
    they are located,

•

our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and
    insurance, and

•

rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities.

Expenses associated with our investment in a community, such as
    debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance
    costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a
    reduction in rental income from that community. If a community
    is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make
    the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of
    foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies
    by the mortgage holder.

Debt Level May Be Increased.

Our current
    debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of
    debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is
    limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We
    manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants,
    but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase
    the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent
    improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.

Financing May Not Be Available and Could Be
    Dilutive.

Our ability to execute our business
    strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt
    financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms
    of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including
    common and preferred equity. Debt or equity financing may not be
    available in sufficient amounts, on favorable terms or at all.
    If we issue additional equity securities to finance developments
    and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our
    existing stockholders could be diluted.

Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our
    Profitability.

We intend to continue to develop
    and construct apartment communities. Development activities may
    be conducted through wholly owned



affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated
    parties. Our development and construction activities may be
    exposed to the following risks:

•

we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining,
    necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other
    required governmental permits and authorizations, which could
    result in increased development costs and could require us to
    abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for
    which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations,

•

if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the
    development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable
    financing for the developments, our development capacity may be
    limited,

•

we may abandon development opportunities that we have already
    begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already
    incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities,

•

we may be unable to complete construction and

lease-up

of
    a community on schedule, or incur development or construction
    costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable
    to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such
    costs,

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may
    fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and
    economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our
    profitability goals for that community, and

•

when we sell homes or properties that we developed or renovated
    to third parties, we may be subject to warranty or construction
    defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our
    insurance.

Construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets,
    and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have, in some
    cases, exceeded our original estimates. We may experience
    similar cost increases in the future. Our inability to charge
    rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any
    increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Some Potential Losses Are Not Covered by
    Insurance.

We maintain insurance policies
    covering our property and operating activities which are of the
    type and in amounts we believe are reasonable and appropriate to
    cover our business. There are, however, certain types of
    extraordinary losses for which we may not have insurance,
    including certain extraordinary losses resulting from
    environmental damage or successive natural disasters or other
    catastrophes. Accordingly, we may sustain uninsured losses due
    to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured
    claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage.

We may not be able to renew insurance coverage in an adequate
    amount or at reasonable prices. In addition, insurance companies
    may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses,
    such as losses due to terrorist acts and mold, or, if offered,
    these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive. If an
    uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we
    could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a
    property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the
    property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain
    obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations
    related to the property. Material losses in excess of insurance
    proceeds may occur in the future. If one or more of our
    significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss,
    it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and
    result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Such
    events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make
    distributions to stockholders.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our
    Growth.

We may make acquisitions outside of our
    existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. We may
    be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new
    markets, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new
    markets. These risks include, among others:

•

inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market
    conditions and local economies,

•

inability to obtain land for development or to identify
    appropriate acquisition opportunities,

•

inability to hire and retain key personnel, and

•

lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting
    procedures.



Changing Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and
    Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow and the Market Price of Our
    Securities.

We currently have, and expect to
    incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary
    with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, we had
    approximately $492.5 million of variable rate indebtedness
    outstanding, which constitutes approximately 15% of our total
    outstanding indebtedness as of such date. An increase in
    interest rates would increase our interest expenses to the
    extent our variable rate debt is not hedged effectively, and it
    would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness
    and of issuing new debt. Accordingly, higher interest rates
    could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our
    debt and to make distributions to security holders. In addition,
    an increase in market interest rates may lead our security
    holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely
    affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and
    debt securities.

Risk of Inflation/Deflation.

Substantial
    inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative
    effect on rental rates and property operating expenses.

Limited Investment Opportunities Could Adversely Affect Our
    Growth.

We expect that other real estate
    investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties
    and to develop new properties. These competitors include
    insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer
    partnerships, investment companies and other apartment REITs.
    This competition could increase prices for properties of the
    type that we would likely pursue, and our competitors may have
    greater resources than we do. As a result, we may not be able to
    make attractive investments on favorable terms, which could
    adversely affect our growth.

Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel
    Could Create Inefficiencies.

To grow
    successfully, we must be able to apply our experience in
    managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a
    larger number of properties. In addition, we must be able to
    integrate new management and operations personnel as our
    organization grows in size and complexity. Failures in either
    area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect
    our expected return on our investments and our overall
    profitability.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May
    Result in Material Charges.

From time to time
    when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit
    our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period
    prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest
    rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the
    predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time
    we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our
    exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in
    market interest rates. If the terms of new debt securities are
    not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall
    below that which we incur under a particular interest rate
    hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore, the
    settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and
    may in the future involve material charges.

Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could
    Result in Substantial Costs.

Under various
    federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or
    former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to
    investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of
    currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic
    substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or
    responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our
    current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. In
    addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or
    to third parties for property damage and for investigation and

clean-up

costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs
    could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws
    create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure
    their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to
    properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially
    and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent
    an affected property.

We Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if We Fail to Qualify
    as a REIT.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT
    under the Code. Our qualification as a REIT requires us to
    satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly
    basis, established under highly technical and complex Code
    provisions for which there are only limited judicial or
    administrative interpretations, and involves the determination
    of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within
    our control. We intend that our current organization and method
    of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT, but we
    may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified
    in the future. In addition, U.S. federal income tax laws
    governing REITs and other corporations and the administrative
    interpretations of those laws may be amended at any



time, potentially with retroactive effect. Future legislation,
    new regulations, administrative interpretations or court
    decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a
    REIT or adversely affect our stockholders.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and
    applicable relief provisions under the Code were not available,
    we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including
    any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at
    regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct
    dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable
    income. Also, unless the Internal Revenue Service, or
    “IRS,” granted us relief under certain statutory
    provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT
    for the four taxable years following the year in which we first
    failed to qualify. The additional tax liability from the failure
    to qualify as a REIT would reduce or eliminate the amount of
    cash available for investment or distribution to our
    stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse
    effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise
    additional capital. In addition, we would no longer be required
    to make distributions to our stockholders. Even if we continue
    to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain
    federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

We May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable REIT
    Subsidiaries, Which are Subject to Certain Tax
    Risks.

We have established taxable REIT
    subsidiaries in which we conduct a portion of our business.
    Despite our qualification as a REIT, our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. In
    addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to
    qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and
    our income from and investments in our taxable REIT subsidiaries
    generally do not constitute permissible income and investments
    for these tests. While we will attempt to ensure that our
    dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not adversely
    affect our REIT qualification, we cannot provide assurance that
    we will successfully achieve that result. Furthermore, we may be
    subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to
    retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable REIT
    subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our
    dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be
    arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected.

Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited
    Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain
    Attributable to the Transaction.

From time to
    time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our
    properties. Under the Code, any gain resulting from transfers of
    properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to
    customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as
    income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty
    tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do
    not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of
    property are prohibited transactions. However, whether property
    is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that
    depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the
    particular transaction. The IRS may contend that certain
    transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited
    transactions. If the IRS were to argue successfully that a
    transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited
    transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax
    on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and
    we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real
    property sales. In addition, income from a prohibited
    transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the
    income tests for qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal
    income tax purposes.

Changes in Market Conditions and Volatility of Stock Prices
    Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common
    Stock.

The stock markets, including the New York
    Stock Exchange, on which we list our common shares, have
    experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a
    result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly
    volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a
    decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases
    unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.

Property Ownership Through Joint Ventures May Limit Our
    Ability to Act Exclusively in Our Interest.

We
    have in the past and expect in the future to develop and acquire
    properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when
    we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. As
    a result, we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more
    of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to
    operate a jointly-owned property. Moreover, joint venture
    partners may have business, economic or other objectives that
    are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that
    relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or
    refinancing of a property. In some instances, joint venture
    partners may have competing interests in our markets that could
    create conflicts of interest.



Real Estate Tax and Other Laws.

Generally we
    do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance
    with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property
    tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in
    income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. These
    costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability
    to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance
    with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential
    liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or
    the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or
    (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws
    regulating housing, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act
    of 1990 and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, may result
    in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely
    affect funds from operations and the ability to make
    distributions to stockholders.

Any Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Stock
    Price.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
    of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal
    report over financial reporting. If we identify one or more
    material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
    reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and
    completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have
    an adverse effect on our stock price.

Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to
    Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in Our
    Stockholders’ Best Interests.

Maryland
    business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to
    acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject
    to various Maryland laws which may have the effect of
    discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the
    difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our
    acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests.
    The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other
    business combination transactions between us and any person who
    acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock
    representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board
    of directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination
    transaction could not be completed until five years after the
    person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the
    approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled
    to be cast and


/


%
    of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested
    stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also
    provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our
    equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of
    the voting power in electing directors will have no voting
    rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares
    eligible to vote.

Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability
    of Our Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company
    May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to Our
    Stockholders.

One of the requirements for
    maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal
    income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our
    outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer
    individuals, including entities specified in the Code, during
    the last half of any taxable year. Our charter contains
    ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock
    primarily to assist us in complying with this and other REIT
    ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the
    effect of preventing a change of control, which does not
    threaten REIT status. These restrictions include a provision
    that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9%
    of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board
    of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation,
    provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to
    exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. These
    provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
    preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a
    change of control might involve a premium price for our
    stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’
    best interests.

Under the terms of our shareholder rights plan, our board of
    directors can, in effect, prevent a person or group from
    acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common
    stock. Unless our board of directors approves the person’s
    purchase, after that person acquires more than 15% of our
    outstanding common stock, all other stockholders will have the
    right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less
    than their then fair market value. Purchases by other
    stockholders would substantially reduce the value and influence
    of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person.
    Our board of directors, however, can prevent the shareholder
    rights plan from operating in this manner. This gives our board
    of directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a
    person’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us.
    Additional information regarding our shareholder rights plan is
    set forth in Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statement included elsewhere in this Report.

    quarterly high and low sale prices per common share reported on
    the NYSE for each quarter of the last two fiscal years.

On February 20, 2007, the closing sale price of our common
    stock was $33.95 per share on the NYSE and there were 5,871
    holders of record of the 135,544,953 outstanding shares of our
    common stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax purposes,
    approximately 38% of the distributions for each of the four
    quarters of 2006 represented ordinary income, 37% represented
    long-term capital gain, and 25% represented unrecaptured
    section 1250 gain.

We pay regular quarterly distributions to holders of shares of
    our common stock. Future distributions will be at the discretion
    of our board of directors and will depend on our actual funds
    from operations, financial condition and capital requirements,
    the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions
    of the Internal Revenue Code, and other factors. The annual
    distribution payment for calendar year 2006 necessary for us to
    maintain our status as a REIT was approximately $0.43 per
    share of common stock. We declared total distributions of
    $1.25 per share of common stock for 2006.

Series E
    Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock has no
    stated par value and a liquidation preference of $16.61 per
    share. Subject to certain adjustments and conditions, each share
    of the Series E is convertible at any time and from time to
    time at the holder’s option into one share of our common
    stock. The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on
    an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the
    holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for
    the election of directors or for any other purpose on which the
    holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E
    has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or
    any mandatory redemption.

Distributions declared on the Series E in 2006 were
    $1.33 per share or $0.3322 per quarter. The
    Series E is not listed on any exchange. At
    December 31, 2006, a total of 2,803,812 shares of the
    Series E were outstanding.



Series F
    Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of our
    Series F Preferred Stock. Our Series F Preferred Stock
    may be purchased by holders of our operating partnership units,
    or OP Units, described below under “Operating
    Partnership Units,” at a purchase price of $0.0001 per
    share. OP Unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and
    purchase one share of our Series F Preferred Stock for each
    OP Unit held. At December 31, 2006, a total of
    666,293 shares of the Series F Preferred Stock were
    outstanding at a value of $66.63. Holders of the Series F
    Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for each share of the
    Series F Preferred Stock they hold, voting together with
    the holders of our common stock, on each matter submitted to a
    vote of securityholders at a meeting of our stockholders. The
    Series F Preferred Stock does not entitle its holders to
    any other rights, privileges or preferences.

Dividend
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under
    which holders of our common stock and our Series B
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock may elect to automatically
    reinvest their distributions and make additional cash payments
    to acquire additional shares of our common stock. Stockholders
    who do not participate in the plan continue to receive dividends
    as declared. As of February 20, 2007, there were 3,372
    participants in the plan.

Operating
    Partnership Units

From time to time we issue shares of our common stock in
    exchange for OP Units tendered to our operating partnerships,
    United Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage Communities L.P., for
    redemption in accordance with the provisions of their respective
    partnership agreements. At December 31, 2006, there were
    9,692,058 OP Units (of which 1,650,322 are owned by the
    holders of the Series A OPPS) and 329,207 OP Units in
    United Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage Communities L.P.,
    respectively, that were owned by limited partners. The holder of
    the OP Units has the right to require United Dominion
    Realty, L.P. to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units
    held by the holder in exchange for a cash payment based on the
    market value of our common stock at the time of redemption.
    However, United Dominion Realty, L.P.’s obligation to pay
    the cash amount is subject to the prior right of the company to
    acquire such OP Units in exchange for either the cash
    amount or shares of our common stock. Heritage Communities L.P.
    OP Units are convertible into common stock in lieu of cash,
    at our option, once the holder elects to convert, at an exchange
    ratio of 1.575 shares for each OP Unit. During 2006,
    we issued a total of 381,001 shares of common stock in
    exchange for OP Units.

Purchases
    of Equity Securities

In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a new
    10 million share repurchase program. This program replaces
    our previous 11 million share repurchase program (of which
    1,180,737 shares were available for repurchase) and
    authorizes the repurchase of our common stock in open market
    purchases, in block purchases, privately negotiated
    transactions, or otherwise. As reflected in the table below, no
    shares of common stock were repurchased under this program or
    otherwise during the quarter ended December 31, 2006.



The following table sets forth certain information regarding our
    common stock repurchases during the quarter ended

Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities

On October 12, 2006, we completed the sale of
    $250 million principal amount of our
    3.625% convertible senior notes due 2011. These notes are
    convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial
    conversion rate of 26.6326 shares per $1,000 principal
    amount of notes, which equates to an initial conversion price of
    approximately $37.55 per share. Because the notes and the
    shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes
    were sold to accredited investors in transactions not involving
    a public offering, the transactions are exempt from registration
    under the Securities Act of 1933 in accordance with
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. In connection with the
    offering of the notes, we also entered into a capped call
    transaction with respect to our common stock with JPMorgan Chase
    Bank, National Association, London Branch, an affiliate of one
    of the initial purchasers of the notes. The capped call
    transaction covers, subject to anti-dilution adjustments similar
    to those contained in the notes, approximately
    6,658,150 shares of our common stock. Information regarding
    the offering of our 3.625% convertible senior notes due
    2011, the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of
    the notes, and the capped call transaction is set forth in our
    Current Report on

Form 8-K

dated October 5, 2006 and filed with the SEC on
    October 12, 2006, and is incorporated herein by reference.

(a)

Reclassified to conform to current year presentation in
    accordance with FASB Statement No. 144, “Accounting
    for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” as
    described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
    statements.

(b)

Funds from operations, or FFO, is defined as net income
    (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of
    depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and
    after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint
    ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association
    of Real Estate Investment Trust’s definition issued in
    April 2002. We consider FFO in evaluating property acquisitions
    and our operating performance and believe that FFO should be
    considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income
    and cash flows as a measure of our activities in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. FFO does not represent
    cash generated from operating activities in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily
    indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. For 2005, FFO
    includes $2.5 million of hurricane related insurance
    recoveries. For 2004, FFO includes a charge of $5.5 million
    to cover hurricane related expenses. For the years ended
    December 31, 2004 and 2003, distributions to preferred
    stockholders exclude $5.7 million and $19.3 million,
    respectively, related to premiums on preferred stock conversions.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Forward-Looking
    Statements

This Report contains forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such
    forward-looking statements include, without limitation,
    statements concerning property acquisitions and dispositions,
    development activity and capital expenditures, capital raising
    activities, rent growth, occupancy, and rental expense growth.
    Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”
    “seeks,” “estimates,” and variations of such
    words and similar expressions are intended to identify such
    forward-looking statements. Such statements involve known and
    unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause
    our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
    different from the results of operations or plans expressed or
    implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors
    include, among other things, unanticipated adverse business
    developments affecting us, or our properties, adverse changes in
    the real estate markets and general and local economies and
    business conditions. Although we believe that the assumptions
    underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are
    reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and
    therefore such statements included in this Report may not prove
    to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties
    inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the
    inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a
    representation by us or any other person that the results or
    conditions described in such statements or our objectives and
    plans will be achieved.

Business
    Overview

We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns,
    acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities
    nationwide. We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In
    June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia
    to Maryland. Our subsidiaries include two operating
    partnerships, Heritage Communities L.P., a Delaware limited
    partnership, and United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware
    limited partnership. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
    references in this Report to “we,” “us,”
    “our,” “the company,” or “UDR”
    refer collectively to United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries.



At December 31, 2006, our portfolio included 242
    communities with 70,339 apartment homes nationwide. The
    following table summarizes our market information by major
    geographic markets (includes real estate held for disposition,
    real estate under development, and land, but excludes commercial

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial
    obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale or
    maturity of existing assets, or by the acquisition of additional
    funds through capital management. Both the coordination of asset
    and liability maturities and effective capital management are
    important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of
    liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by
    rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related
    to our portfolio of apartment homes. We routinely use our
    unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain
    investing and financing activities prior to arranging for
    longer-term financing. During the past several years, proceeds
    from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing
    and financing activities.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements
    generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings
    under credit arrangements. We expect to meet certain long-term
    liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the
    repayment of financing on development activities, and potential
    property acquisitions, through long-term secured and unsecured
    borrowings, the disposition of properties, and the issuance of
    additional debt or equity securities. We believe that our net
    cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet
    both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the
    company in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short-
    and long-term. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for
    improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected
    to be funded from property operations.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission which provides for the issuance of an
    indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt
    securities, warrants, purchase contracts and units to facilitate
    future financing activities in the public capital markets.
    Access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at
    the time of issuance.

Future
    Capital Needs

Future development expenditures are expected to be funded with
    proceeds from the sale of property, with construction loans,
    through joint ventures and, to a lesser extent, with cash flows
    provided by operating activities. Acquisition activity in
    strategic markets is expected to be largely financed through the
    issuance of equity and debt securities, the issuance of
    operating partnership units, the assumption or placement of
    secured

and/or

unsecured debt and by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale
    of properties.

During 2007, we have approximately $81.7 million of secured
    debt and $167.3 million of unsecured debt maturing and we
    anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings
    under our secured or unsecured credit facilities, the issuance
    of new unsecured debt securities or equity or from disposition
    proceeds.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our critical accounting policies are those having the most
    impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results
    and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. These
    policies include those related to (1) capital expenditures,
    (2) impairment of long-lived assets, and (3) real
    estate investment properties. With respect to these critical
    accounting policies, we believe that the application of
    judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces
    financial information that fairly depicts the results of
    operations for all periods presented.

Capital
    Expenditures

In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States, we capitalize those expenditures related to
    acquiring new assets, materially enhancing the value of an
    existing asset, or substantially extending the useful life of an
    existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing
    property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as
    incurred.

During 2006, $215.7 million or $2,996 per home was
    spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities,
    excluding development, condominium conversions and commercial
    properties. These capital improvements included turnover related
    expenditures for floor coverings and appliances, other recurring
    capital expenditures such as roofs, siding, parking lots, and
    other non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures, which



aggregated $34.6 million or $480 per home. In
    addition, revenue enhancing capital expenditures, kitchen and
    bath upgrades, upgrades to HVAC equipment, and other extensive
    exterior/interior upgrades totaled $144.1 million or
    $2,002 per home, and major renovations totaled
    $37.0 million or $514 per home for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

The following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and
    maintenance costs for all of our communities, excluding real
    estate under development, condominium conversions and commercial
    properties for the periods presented:

Total capital improvements increased $59.6 million or
    $934 per home for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the same period in 2005. This increase was
    attributable to an additional $18.3 million of major
    renovations at certain of our properties. These renovations
    included the re-wiring

and/or

re-plumbing of an entire building as well as major structural
    changes

and/or

architectural revisions to existing buildings. The increase was
    also attributable to an additional $45.5 million being
    invested in revenue enhancing improvements. These increases were
    offset by a $4.2 million decrease in recurring capital
    expenditures. We will continue to selectively add revenue
    enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on
    investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital.
    Recurring capital expenditures during 2007 are currently
    expected to be approximately $610 per home.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
    operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
    assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
    estimated to be generated by the future operation and
    disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of
    those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical
    results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market
    and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The
    net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market
    value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best
    estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market
    rates and transactions.

Real
    Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time
    and allocate the purchase price to various components, such as
    land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases in
    accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, “Business
    Combinations.” The purchase price is allocated based on the
    relative fair value of each component. The fair value of
    buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon
    acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As
    such, the determination of fair value considers the present



value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the
    property including an initial

lease-up

period. We determine the fair value of in-place leases by
    assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease
    relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In
    addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the
    foregone rents associated with the

lease-up

period, and the carrying costs associated with the

lease-up

period. The fair value of in-place leases is recorded and
    amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual
    lease period.

Statements
    of Cash Flow

The following discussion explains the changes in net cash
    provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing
    and financing activities that are presented in our Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows.

Operating
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2006, our net cash flow
    provided by operating activities was $229.6 million
    compared to $248.2 million for 2005. During 2006, the
    decrease in cash flow from operating activities resulted
    primarily from an $18.5 million increase in interest
    expense, a decrease of $17.1 million in other income due to
    a 2005 sale of a technology investment, an $11.4 million
    increase in operating assets and a $9.8 million decrease in
    operating liabilities in 2006 as compared to 2005. These
    decreases in cash flow from operating activities were partially
    offset by a $34.2 million increase in property operating
    results from our apartment community portfolio (see discussion
    under “Apartment Community Operations”),
    $5.1 million more in gains recognized from the sale of
    depreciable property and an unconsolidated joint venture in 2006
    as compared to 2005, and an $8.5 million decrease in
    prepayment penalties from 2005.

Investing
    Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in
    investing activities was $150.0 million compared to
    $219.0 million for 2005. Changes in the level of investing
    activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it
    relates to our acquisition, capital expenditure, development,
    and disposition programs, as well as the impact of the capital
    market environment on these activities, all of which are
    discussed in further detail below.

Acquisitions

For the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired eight
    apartment communities with 2,763 apartment homes for an
    aggregate consideration of $327.5 million and two parcels
    of land for $19.9 million. For 2005, we acquired eight
    apartment communities with 2,561 apartment homes for an
    aggregate consideration of $390.9 million and one parcel of
    land for $2.9 million. Our long-term strategic plan is to
    achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer,
    more concentrated markets. As a result, we have been expanding
    our interests in the fast growing Southern California, Florida,
    and Metropolitan Washington DC markets over the past three
    years. During 2007, we plan to continue to channel new
    investments into those markets we believe will provide the best
    investment returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined
    criteria including past performance, expected job growth,
    current and anticipated housing supply and demand and the
    ability to attract and support household formation.

Real
    Estate Under Development

Development activity is focused in core markets in which we have
    strong operations in place. For the year ended December 31,
    2006, we invested approximately $101.8 million in
    development projects, an increase of $52.5 million from our
    2005 level of $49.3 million.

In addition, we owned five parcels of land held for future

    2006.

Development
    Joint Ventures

In June 2006, we completed the formation of a development joint
    venture that will invest approximately $138 million to
    develop one apartment community with 298 apartment homes in
    Marina del Rey, California. UDR is the financial partner and is
    responsible for funding the costs of development and receives a
    preferred return from 7% to 8.5% before our partner receives a
    50% participation. Our initial investment was $27.5 million.

In July 2006, we closed on a joint venture to develop a site in
    Bellevue, Washington. At closing, we owned 49% of the
    $135 million project that involves building a 400 home high
    rise apartment building with ground floor retail. Our initial
    investment was $5.7 million.

In November 2006, we closed on a joint venture to develop a site
    close to Bellevue Plaza in the central business district of
    Bellevue, Washington. This project will include the development
    of 271 apartment homes. Construction began in the fourth quarter
    of 2006 and is scheduled for completion in 2008. At closing, we
    owned 49% of the $97 million project. Our initial
    investment was $10.0 million.

Under FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
    Variable Interest Entities,” these ventures have been
    consolidated into UDR’s financial statements. Our joint
    venture partners are the managing partners as well as the
    developers, general contractors, and property managers.

Disposition
    of Investments

For the year ended December 31, 2006, UDR sold 24
    communities with 7,653 apartment homes for a gross consideration
    of $444.9 million. In addition, we sold 384 condominiums
    from four communities with a total of 612 condominiums for a
    gross consideration of $72.1 million. We recognized
    after-tax gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $148.6 million on these sales. Proceeds from the sales were
    used primarily to reduce debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, UDR sold 22
    communities with 6,352 apartment homes and 240 condominiums from
    five communities with a total of 648 condominiums for a gross
    consideration of $456.3 million. In addition, we sold our
    investment in an unconsolidated joint venture for
    $39.2 million and one parcel of land for $0.9 million.
    We recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $143.5 million on these sales. Proceeds from the sales were
    used primarily to reduce debt and acquire additional
    communities. In conjunction with the sale of ten communities in
    July 2005, we received short-term notes for $124.7 million
    that bear interest at 6.75% and had maturities ranging from
    September 2005 to July 2006. As of December 31, 2006, all
    of the notes receivable had matured and had been repaid. We
    recognized previously deferred gains for financial reporting
    purposes of $6.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

During 2007, we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of
    exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and
    redeploying capital into those markets we believe will provide
    the best investment returns. We intend to use the proceeds from
    2007 dispositions to reduce debt, acquire communities, and fund
    development activity.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities during 2006 was
    $93.0 million compared to $21.5 million in 2005. As
    part of the plan to improve our balance sheet, we utilized
    proceeds from dispositions, equity and debt offerings, and
    refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, and
    purchase new properties.

The following is a summary of our financing activities for the
    year ended December 31, 2006:

•

Repaid $70.3 million of secured debt and
    $138.8 million of unsecured debt.

•

Authorized a new 10 million share repurchase program in
    February 2006. This program replaces our previous
    11 million share repurchase program under which we
    repurchased approximately 10 million shares.

•

Sold $125 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.05% senior unsecured notes due June 2013 in June 2006
    under our medium-term note program. The net proceeds of
    approximately $124 million were used for debt repayment.

•

Sold $250 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.625% convertible senior unsecured notes due 2011 in
    October 2006. The net proceeds of approximately
    $245 million were used for the repayment of indebtedness
    under our revolving credit facility, the cost of a capped call
    transaction, and for other general corporate purposes. The
    capped call instrument effectively increased the conversion
    premium to 40%.

Credit
    Facilities

We have four secured revolving credit facilities with Fannie Mae
    with an aggregate commitment of $860 million. As of
    December 31, 2006, $691.8 million was outstanding
    under the Fannie Mae credit facilities leaving
    $168.2 million of unused capacity. The Fannie Mae credit
    facilities are for an initial term of ten years, bear interest
    at floating and fixed rates, and can be extended for an
    additional five years at our discretion. We have
    $399.4 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted
    average interest rate of 6.1% and the remaining balance on these
    facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of
    5.9%.

We have a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility
    that matures in May 2008 and, at our option, can be extended an
    additional year. We have the right to increase the credit
    facility to $750 million under



certain circumstances. Based on our current credit ratings, the
    credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus
    57.5 basis points. Under a competitive bid feature, and for
    so long as we maintain an Investment Grade Rating, we have the
    right to bid out 100% of the commitment amount. As of
    December 31, 2006, $87.2 million was outstanding under
    the credit facility leaving $412.8 million of unused
    capacity.

The Fannie Mae credit facility and the bank revolving credit
    facility are subject to customary financial covenants and
    limitations.

Interest
    Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable
    rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced.
    We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other
    speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial
    instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets.
    Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in
    market interest rates and the fair value of market rate
    sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as
    changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable
    rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. A large portion of our
    market risk is exposure to short-term interest rates from
    variable rate borrowings outstanding under our Fannie Mae credit
    facility and our bank revolving credit facility, which totaled
    $292.5 million and $87.2 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2006. The impact on our financial statements
    of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2006 was
    immaterial.

If market interest rates for variable rate debt
    average 100 basis points more in 2007 than they did
    during 2006, our interest expense would increase, and income
    before taxes would decrease by $4.9 million. Comparatively,
    if market interest rates for variable rate debt had averaged
    100 basis points more in 2006 than in 2005, our interest
    expense would have increased, and net income would have
    decreased by $6.0 million. If market rates for fixed rate
    debt were 100 basis points higher at December 31,
    2006, the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased
    from $2.7 billion to $2.6 billion. If market interest
    rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points lower at
    December 31, 2006, the fair value of fixed rate debt would
    have increased from $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of
    hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These
    analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of
    overall economic activity that could exist in such an
    environment. Further, in the event of a change of such
    magnitude, management would likely take actions to further
    mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the
    uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and
    their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no
    change in our financial structure.

Funds
    from Operations

Funds from operations, or FFO, is defined as net income
    (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of
    depreciable property, plus real estate depreciation and
    amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
    partnerships and joint ventures. We compute FFO for all periods
    presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by
    the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s
    (“NAREIT”) April 1, 2002 White Paper. We consider
    FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating
    performance, and believe that FFO should be considered along
    with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as
    a measure of our activities in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles. FFO does not represent cash
    generated from operating activities in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative
    of cash available to fund cash needs.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles implicitly assumes
    that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over
    time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen
    or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and
    analysts have considered the presentation of operating results
    for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to
    be insufficient by themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a
    supplemental measure of REIT operating performance and defines
    FFO as net income (computed in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States), excluding
    gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus



depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The use of FFO,
    combined with the required presentations, has been fundamentally
    beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results of
    REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT
    operating results more meaningful. We generally consider FFO to
    be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and
    financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in
    conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of
    performance) because by excluding gains or losses related to
    sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and
    excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO
    can help one compare the operating performance of a
    company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
    different companies. We believe that FFO is the best measure of
    economic profitability for real estate investment trusts.

The following table outlines our FFO calculation and
    reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles for
    the three years ended December 31, 2006

In the computation of diluted FFO, OP Units,
    out-performance partnership shares, and the shares of
    Series D Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock
    and Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are
    dilutive; therefore, they are included in the diluted share
    count. For the year ended December 31, 2004, distributions
    to preferred stockholders exclude $5.7 million related to
    premiums on preferred stock conversions.

Net incremental gains on the sale of condominium homes and the
    net incremental gain on the disposition of real estate
    investments developed for sale are defined as net sales proceeds
    less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset
    before accumulated depreciation. We consider FFO with
    gains/losses on the sale of condominium homes and gains/losses
    on the disposition of real estate investments developed for sale
    to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because
    the short-term use of funds produce a profit that differs from
    the traditional long-term investment in real estate for REITs.

FFO also does not represent cash generated from operating

    alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as
    determined by generally accepted accounting principles, as a
    measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily
    indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs. A

Results

The following discussion includes the results of both continuing
    and discontinued operations for the periods presented.

Net
    Income Available to Common Stockholders

2006-vs.-2005

Net income available to common stockholders was
    $113.2 million ($0.85 per diluted share) for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to $139.8 million
    ($1.03 per diluted share) for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, representing a decrease of
    $26.6 million ($0.18 per diluted share). The decrease
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, when compared to the
    same period in 2005, resulted primarily from the following
    items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere
    within this Report:

•

$31.7 million more in depreciation and amortization expense
    in 2006,

•

$18.5 million more in interest expense in 2006,



•

$17.1 million less in non-property income in 2006, and

•

$6.4 million more in general and administrative expense in
    2006.

These decreases in net income were partially offset by
    $5.1 million more in gains recognized from the sale of
    depreciable property and an unconsolidated joint venture, an
    $8.5 million decrease in losses on early debt retirement,
    and a $34.2 million increase in apartment community
    operating results in 2006 when compared to 2005.

2005-vs.-2004

Net income available to common stockholders was
    $139.8 million ($1.03 per diluted share) for the year
    ended December 31, 2005, compared to $71.9 million
    ($0.56 per diluted share) for the year ended
    December 31, 2004, representing an increase of
    $67.9 million ($0.47 per diluted share). The increase
    in net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, when
    compared to the same period in 2004, resulted primarily from the
    following items, all of which are discussed in further detail
    elsewhere within this Report:

•

$90.6 million more in gains recognized from the sale of
    depreciable property and an unconsolidated joint venture in 2005,

•

a $32.6 million increase in apartment community operating
    results in 2005,

•

an $18.1 million increase in non-property income in 2005,

•

a $5.7 million decrease in premiums paid on preferred stock
    conversions in 2005,

•

a $5.5 million charge recorded for hurricane related
    expenses in 2004,

•

$4.2 million less in preferred stock distributions in
    2005, and

•

$2.5 million in hurricane related insurance recoveries in
    2005.

These increases in net income were partially offset by a
    $38.7 million increase in interest expense, a
    $31.8 million increase in real estate depreciation and
    amortization expense, an $8.5 million increase in losses on
    early debt retirement, and a $5.5 million increase in
    general and administrative expense in 2005 when compared to 2004.

Apartment
    Community Operations

Our net income is primarily generated from the operation of our
    apartment communities. The following table summarizes the

2006-vs.-2005

Same
    Communities

Our same communities (those communities acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to December 31, 2005 and held on
    December 31, 2006, which consisted of 60,062 apartment
    homes) provided 82% of our property operating income for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, same community
    property operating income increased 8.6% or $30.4 million
    compared to 2005. The increase in property operating income was
    primarily attributable to a 6.0% or $34.2 million increase
    in revenues from rental and other income that was offset by a
    1.8% or $3.9 million increase in operating expenses. The
    increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily
    driven by a 4.9% or $28.4 million increase in rental rates,
    a 17.6% or $2.2 million decrease in concession expense, and
    a 12.5% or $5.0 million increase in utility reimbursement
    income and fee income. Physical occupancy increased 0.1% to
    94.7%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 15.8% or $1.6 million increase in insurance costs, a
    4.4% or $1.5 million increase in utility costs, a 2.8% or
    $1.5 million increase in personnel costs, a 1.1% or
    $0.4 million increase in repair and maintenance expenses,
    and a 0.5% or $0.3 million increase in real estate taxes.
    These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a
    6.0% or $1.2 million decrease in administrative and
    marketing expenses.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property
    operating income divided by property rental income) increased
    1.5% to 63.5%.

Non-Mature
    Communities

The remaining 18% of our property operating income during 2006
    was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities” (primarily those communities
    acquired or developed in 2005 and 2006, sold properties, and
    those properties classified as real estate held for
    disposition). The 16 communities with 5,324 apartment homes that
    we acquired in 2005 and 2006 provided $32.8 million of
    property operating income. The 46 communities with 14,005 homes
    and the 624 condominiums from five communities that we sold in
    2005 and 2006 provided $18.3 million of property operating
    income. In addition, our development communities, which included
    438 apartment homes completed in 2005 and 2006, provided
    $2.2 million of operating income and the two communities
    with 475 apartment homes, one community with 320



condominiums, and the one commercial unit classified as real
    estate held for disposition provided $5.5 million of
    property operating income. Other non-mature communities provided
    $23.1 million of property operating income for the year
    ended December 31, 2006.

2005-vs.-2004

Same
    Communities

Our same communities (those communities acquired, developed, and
    stabilized prior to September 30, 2004 and held on
    December 31, 2005, which consisted of 58,840 apartment
    homes) provided 73% of our property operating income for the
    year ended December 31, 2005.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, same community
    property operating income increased 3.4% or $10.3 million
    compared to 2004. The increase in property operating income was
    primarily attributable to a 3.8% or $18.6 million increase
    in revenues from rental and other income that was partially
    offset by a 4.4% or $8.3 million increase in operating
    expenses. The increase in revenues from rental and other income
    was primarily driven by a 2.0% or $10.3 million increase in
    rental rates, a 20.2% or $2.9 million decrease in
    concession expense, a 7.5% or $2.6 million increase in
    utility reimbursement income and fee income, a 7.8% or
    $2.5 million decrease in vacancy loss, and a 15.6% or
    $0.4 million decrease in bad debt expense. Physical
    occupancy increased 0.6% to 94.5%.

The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven
    by a 4.3% or $2.0 million increase in real estate taxes, a
    3.8% or $1.9 million increase in personnel costs, a 3.8% or
    $1.1 million increase in utilities expense, a 2.9% or
    $0.9 million increase in repair and maintenance costs, a
    4.7% or $0.8 million increase in administrative and
    marketing costs, a 46.7% or $0.7 million increase in
    incentive compensation, and a 5.4% or $0.5 million increase
    in insurance costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income
    and property operating expenses, the operating margin decreased
    0.3% to 61.5%.

Non-Mature
    Communities

The remaining 27% of our property operating income during 2005
    was generated from communities that we classify as
    “non-mature communities” (primarily those communities
    acquired or developed in 2003, 2004 and 2005, sold properties,
    and those properties classified as real estate held for
    disposition). The 41 communities with 12,458 apartment homes
    that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2003, and in 2004 and
    2005, provided $87.5 million of property operating income.
    The 22 communities with 6,352 apartment homes and 240
    condominiums sold during 2005 provided $10.0 million of
    property operating income. In addition, our development
    communities, which included 244 apartment homes constructed
    since January 1, 2003, provided $0.7 million of
    property operating income during 2005, the four communities with
    a total of 384 condominiums classified as real estate held for
    disposition provided $0.3 million of property operating
    income, and other non-mature communities which includes homes
    that are undergoing major rehabilitation, provided
    $17.5 million of property operating income for the year
    ended December 31, 2005.

Real
    Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2006, real estate
    depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
    discontinued operations increased $31.7 million or 14.8%
    compared to 2005, primarily due to the significant increase in
    per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio and
    other capital expenditures.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, real estate
    depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
    discontinued operations increased $31.8 million or 17.6%
    compared to 2004, primarily due to the significant increase in
    the per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio
    and other capital expenditures.



Interest
    Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2006, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations increased
    $18.5 million or 11.3% from 2005 primarily due to the
    issuance of debt and higher interest rates. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the weighted average amount of debt
    outstanding increased 11.7% or $350.4 million compared to
    2005 and the weighted average interest rate increased from 5.3%
    to 5.4% during 2006. The weighted average amount of debt
    outstanding during 2006 is higher than 2005 as acquisition costs
    in 2005 and in 2006 have been funded, in most part, by the
    issuance of debt. The increase in the weighted average interest
    rate during 2006 reflects short-term bank borrowings and
    variable rate debt that had higher interest rates when compared
    to the prior year that were partially offset by the retirement
    of higher coupon debt with lower coupon debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, interest expense on
    both continuing and discontinued operations increased
    $47.2 million or 38.1% from 2004 primarily due to the
    issuance of debt and $8.5 million in prepayment penalties.
    For the year ended December 31, 2005, the weighted average
    amount of debt outstanding increased 30.7% or
    $697.4 million compared to 2004 and the weighted average
    interest rate increased from 5.0% to 5.3% during 2005. The
    weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2005 is
    higher than 2004 as acquisition costs in 2005 have been funded,
    in most part, by the issuance of debt. The increase in the
    weighted average interest rate during 2005 reflects short-term
    bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had higher interest
    rates when compared to the prior year.

General
    and Administrative

For the year ended December 31, 2006, general and
    administrative expenses increased $6.4 million or 25.7%
    over 2005 due to a number of factors, including increases in
    incentive compensation, professional fees, relocation costs, and
    an operating lease on an airplane.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, general and
    administrative expenses increased $5.5 million or 28.5%
    over 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in personnel and
    incentive compensation costs, an operating lease on an airplane,
    compliance costs and an operations improvement initiative.

Hurricane
    Related Expenses and Hurricane Related Insurance
    Recoveries

In 2005, $2.5 million of hurricane related insurance
    recoveries were recorded. In 2004, we recognized a
    $5.5 million charge to cover expenses associated with the
    damage in Florida caused by hurricanes Charley, Frances, and
    Jeanne. UDR reported that 25 of our 34 Florida communities were
    affected by the hurricanes.

Gains on
    the Sale of Land, Depreciable Property and an Unconsolidated
    Joint Venture

For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we
    recognized after-tax gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $148.6 million and $143.5 million, respectively.
    Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period
    reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from
    period to period as well as the extent of gains related to
    specific properties sold.

Premium
    on Preferred Stock Conversions

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we exercised our right to redeem
    2 million shares of our Series D Cumulative
    Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of our
    redemption notice, the shares to be redeemed were converted by
    the holder into 3,076,769 shares of common stock at a price
    of $16.25 per share. As a result, we recognized a
    $5.7 million premium on preferred stock conversions.

The premium amount recognized to convert these shares represents
    the cumulative accretion to date between the conversion value of
    the preferred stock and the value at which it was recorded at
    the time of issuance.



eBay
    Purchase of Rent.com

On December 16, 2004, eBay announced that it had agreed to
    acquire privately held Rent.com, a leading Internet listing web
    site in the apartment and rental housing industry, for
    approximately $415 million plus acquisition costs, net of
    Rent.com’s cash on hand. On February 23, 2005, eBay
    announced that it had completed the acquisition. We owned shares
    in Rent.com, and as a result of the transaction, we recorded a
    one-time pre-tax gain of $12.3 million on the sale. In
    August 2006, we received an additional $0.8 million
    representing our portion of the escrow balance.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our
    operations have been immaterial. Substantially all of our leases
    are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our
    risk from the adverse effects of inflation.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or
    are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our
    financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or
    expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
    or capital resources that are material.

Factors
    Affecting Our Business and Prospects

There are many factors that affect our business and the results
    of our operations, some of which are beyond our control. These
    factors include:

•

unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions
    that could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental rates and
    purchase or sale prices of apartment communities,

•

the failure of acquisitions to achieve anticipated results,

•

possible difficulty in selling apartment communities,

•

the timing and closing of planned dispositions under agreement,

•

competitive factors that may limit our ability to lease
    apartment homes or increase or maintain rents,

•

insufficient cash flow that could affect our debt financing and
    create refinancing risk,

•

failure to generate sufficient revenue, which could impair our
    debt service payments and distributions to stockholders,

•

development and construction risks that may impact our
    profitability,



•

potential damage from natural disasters, including hurricanes
    and other weather-related events, which could result in
    substantial costs,

•

delays in completing developments and

lease-ups

on
    schedule,

•

our failure to succeed in new markets,

•

changing interest rates, which could increase interest costs and
    affect the market price of our securities,

•

potential liability for environmental contamination, which could
    result in substantial costs, and

•

the imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a REIT
    in any taxable year.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2006, we carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures
    are designed with the objective of ensuring that information
    required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
    alerting them to material information required to be included in
    our periodic SEC reports.

It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is
    based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
    future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
    will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
    future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective under
    circumstances where our disclosure controls and procedures
    should reasonably be expected to operate effectively.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

UDR’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, UDR’s Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting based on the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO).

Based on UDR’s evaluation, management concluded that our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2006. Management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over



financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been
    audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is
    included herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
    concluded that during the quarter ended December 31, 2006,
    there has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
    to materially affect, our internal control over financial
    reporting.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

Board of Directors and Stockholders

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting included at Item 9A, that United
    Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. (the “Company”) maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006 of United
    Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and our report dated
    February 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Stockholders

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. (the “Company”) as
    of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23,
    2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31,

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization
    and formation

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was
    formed in 1972. We operate within one defined business segment
    with activities related to the ownership, management,
    development, acquisition, renovation, and disposition of
    multifamily apartment communities nationwide. At
    December 31, 2006, we owned 242 communities and had five
    communities under development.

Basis
    of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of UDR and its subsidiaries, including United Dominion
    Realty, L.P., (the “Operating Partnership”), and
    Heritage Communities L.P. (the “Heritage OP”),
    (collectively, “UDR”). As of December 31, 2006,
    there were 166,185,740 units in the Operating Partnership
    outstanding, of which 156,493,682 units or 94% were owned
    by UDR and 9,692,058 units or 6% were owned by limited
    partners (of which 1,650,322 are owned by the holders of the
    Series A OPPS). As of December 31, 2006, there were
    5,542,200 units in the Heritage OP outstanding, of which
    5,212,993 units or 94% were owned by UDR and
    329,207 units or 6% were owned by limited partners. The
    consolidated financial statements of UDR include the minority
    interests of the unitholders in the Operating Partnership and
    the Heritage OP. All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of these financial statements requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
    contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements
    and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual amounts realized or paid could differ from those
    estimates. Certain previously reported amounts have been
    reclassified to conform to the current financial statement
    presentation.

Real
    estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical
    cost less accumulated depreciation and any recorded impairment
    losses.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are
    charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements,
    renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition

and/or

improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost and
    depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the value of
    the existing asset will be materially enhanced or the life of
    the related asset will be substantially extended beyond the
    original life expectancy.

UDR recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
    operations when there is an event or change in circumstance that
    indicates an impairment in the value of an asset and the
    undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the
    asset’s carrying value. Our cash flow estimates are based
    upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of
    future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding
    periods. If such indicators of impairment are present, an
    impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the
    carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Our estimates
    of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon
    industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

UDR purchases real estate investment properties from time to
    time and allocates the purchase price to various components,
    such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place
    leases in accordance with FASB Statement No. 141,
    “Business Combinations.” The purchase price is
    allocated based on the relative fair



UNITED
    DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value of each component. The fair value of buildings is
    determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and
    subsequently leased at market rental rates. As such, the
    determination of fair value considers the present value of all
    cash flows expected to be generated from the property including
    an initial lease up period. UDR determines the fair value of
    in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and
    remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar
    leases at acquisition. The fair value of in-place leases is
    recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the
    remaining contractual lease period. UDR determines the fair
    value of in-place leases by considering the cost of acquiring
    similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the

lease-up

period, and the carrying costs associated with the

lease-up

period.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are
    recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost
    to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties
    classified as real estate held for disposition generally
    represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted
    for sale which are expected to close within the next twelve
    months. Real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower
    of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less
    the cost to dispose, determined on an

asset-by-asset

basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on
    held for disposition properties are charged to expense as
    incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and
    replacements related to held for disposition properties are
    capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate
    held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets which is
    35 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major
    improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures,
    equipment, and other assets. The value of acquired in-place
    leases is amortized over the remaining term of each acquired
    in-place lease.

All development projects and related carrying costs are
    capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
    “Real estate under development.” As each building in a
    project is completed and becomes available for

lease-up,

the total cost of the building is transferred to real estate
    held for investment and the assets are depreciated over their
    estimated useful lives. The cost of development projects
    includes interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated
    development overhead during the construction period.

Interest, real estate taxes, and incremental labor and support
    costs for personnel working directly on the development site are
    capitalized as part of the real estate under development to the
    extent that such charges do not cause the carrying value of the
    asset to exceed its net realizable value. During 2006, 2005, and
    2004, total interest capitalized was $5.2 million,
    $2.8 million, and $1.0 million, respectively.

Cash
    equivalents

Cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with
    maturities of three months or less when purchased.

Restricted
    cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for
    real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and
    security deposits.

Deferred
    financing costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and other external costs
    incurred to obtain debt financings and are generally amortized
    on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective
    interest method, over a period not to exceed the term of the
    related debt. Unamortized financing costs are written-off when
    debt is retired before its maturity date. During 2006, 2005, and
    2004, amortization expense was $6.1 million,
    $6.5 million, and $5.1 million, respectively.



UNITED
    DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Investments
    in unconsolidated development joint ventures

Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for
    using the equity method when major business decisions require
    approval by the other partners and UDR does not have control of
    the assets. Investments are recorded at cost and subsequently
    adjusted for equity in net income (loss) and cash contributions
    and distributions. UDR eliminates intercompany profits on sales
    of services that are provided to joint ventures. Differences
    between the carrying value of investments and the underlying
    equity in net assets of the investee are due to capitalized
    interest on the investment balance and capitalized development
    and leasing costs that are recovered by UDR through fees during
    construction.

Revenue
    recognition

UDR’s apartment homes are leased under operating leases
    with terms generally of one year or less. Rental income is
    recognized as it is earned and collectability is reasonably
    assured.

Advertising
    costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item
    “Administrative and marketing.” During 2006, 2005, and
    2004, total advertising expense was $9.3 million,
    $11.2 million, and $10.5 million, respectively

Interest
    rate swap agreements

UDR accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance with
    Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 and
    No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” At December 31,
    2006, UDR has no derivative financial instruments reported on
    its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Prior to their maturity in July
    2004, UDR’s derivative financial instruments consisted of
    interest rate swap agreements that were designated as cash flow
    hedges of debt with variable interest rate features, and as
    qualifying hedges for financial reporting purposes. For a
    derivative instrument that qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
    instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive
    income and reclassified into earnings during the same period or
    periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
    The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in
    excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future
    cash flows of the hedged item, if any, is recognized in current
    earnings during the period of change.

As part of UDR’s overall interest rate risk management
    strategy, UDR used derivative financial instruments as a means
    to artificially fix variable rate debt or to hedge anticipated
    financing transactions. UDR’s derivative transactions used
    for interest rate risk management included various interest rate
    swaps with indices that related to the pricing of specific
    financial instruments of UDR. Because of the close correlation
    between the hedging instrument and the underlying cash flow
    exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the
    derivative instruments were generally offset by changes in the
    cash flow of the underlying exposures. As a result, UDR
    appropriately controlled the risk so that derivatives used for
    interest rate risk management would not have a material
    unintended effect on consolidated earnings. UDR does not enter
    into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

The fair value of UDR’s derivative instruments were
    reported on the balance sheet at their current fair value. The
    estimated fair value for our interest rate swaps relied on
    prevailing market interest rates. The interest rate swap
    agreements were designated with all or a portion of the
    principal balance and term of a specific debt obligation. Each
    interest rate swap involved the periodic exchange of payments
    over the life of the related agreement. An amount received or
    paid on the interest rate swap was recorded on an accrual basis
    as an adjustment to the related interest expense of the
    outstanding debt based on the accrual method of



UNITED
    DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accounting. The related amount payable to and receivable from
    counterparties was included in other liabilities and other
    assets, respectively.

When the terms of the underlying transaction were modified, or
    when the underlying hedged item ceased to exist, all changes in
    the fair value of the instrument were

marked-to-market

with changes in value included in net income each period until
    the instrument matured, unless the instrument was redesignated
    as a hedge of another transaction. If a derivative instrument
    was terminated or the hedging transaction was no longer
    determined to be effective, amounts held in accumulated other
    comprehensive income were reclassified into earnings over the
    term of the future cash outflows on the related debt.

Comprehensive
    income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in equity
    during each period except for those resulting from investments
    by or distributions to stockholders, is displayed in the
    accompanying Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Other
    comprehensive income for 2004 consisted of unrealized gains or
    losses from derivative financial instruments. There is no
    difference between net income and total comprehensive income for
    2006 and 2005.

Stock-based
    employee compensation plans

UDR adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for
    share-based payments effective January 1, 2004, using the
    prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148

,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure.” UDR adopted
    Statement 123(R) on January 1, 2006, and has continued
    to use the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the value of
    stock options granted to employees, which have not been granted
    since 2002. Statement 123(R) must be applied not only to
    new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully
    vested on the effective date (as of January 1, 2006, there
    were no unvested stock options). UDR adopted Statement 123
    using the modified prospective transition method (which applied
    only to awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption
    date). The adoption of the provisions of Statement 123(R)
    did not have a material impact on our financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows.

Minority
    interests of unitholders in operating partnerships

Interests in operating partnerships held by limited partners are
    represented by operating partnership units
    (“OP Units”). The operating partnerships’
    income is allocated to holders of OP Units based upon net
    income available to common stockholders and the weighted average
    number of OP Units outstanding to total common shares plus
    OP Units outstanding during the period. Capital
    contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are
    allocated to minority interests in accordance with the terms of
    the individual partnership agreements. OP Units can be
    exchanged for cash or shares of UDR’s common stock on a

one-for-one

basis, at the option of UDR. OP Units, as a percentage of
    total OP Units and shares outstanding, were 6.1% at
    December 31, 2006, 5.9% at December 31, 2005, and 6.3%
    at December 31, 2004.

Minority
    interests of outside partnerships

UDR has limited partners in certain real estate partnerships
    acquired in certain merger transactions. Net income for these
    partnerships is allocated based upon the percentage interest
    owned by these limited partners in each respective real estate
    partnership.

Earnings
    per share

Basic earnings per common share is computed based upon the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based upon
    common



UNITED
    DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive stock options and
    other potentially dilutive common stock equivalents. The
    dilutive effect of stock options and other potentially dilutive
    common stock equivalents is determined using the treasury stock
    method based on UDR’s average stock price.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
    diluted earning per share

(dollars in thousands, except per
    share amounts):

The effect of the conversion of the operating partnership units,
    Series A, Series C, and Series D Out-Performance
    Partnership Shares, convertible preferred stock, and convertible
    debt is not dilutive and is therefore not included in the above
    calculations. If the operating partnership units were converted
    to common stock, the additional shares of common stock
    outstanding for the three years ended December 31, 2006,
    would be 8,693,981, 8,545,786, and 8,669,310 weighted average
    common shares, respectively. If the Series A
    Out-Performance Partnership Shares were converted to common
    stock, the additional shares of common stock outstanding for the
    three years ended December 31, 2006, would be 1,716,659,
    1,778,251, and 1,791,329 weighted average common shares,
    respectively. If the convertible preferred stock were converted
    to common stock, the additional shares of common stock
    outstanding for the three years ended December 31, 2006,
    would be 2,803,812, 2,803,812, and 6,301,821 weighted average
    common shares, respectively. If the Series C and
    Series D Out-Performance Partnership Shares were converted
    to common stock, the additional shares of common stock
    outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2006, would be
    313,145 and 75,869 weighted average common shares, respectively.
    If the convertible debt was converted to common stock, the
    additional shares of common stock outstanding for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, would be 68,132 weighted average common
    shares.

Income
    taxes

UDR is operated as, and elects to be taxed as, a real estate
    investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Generally, a
    REIT complies with the provisions of the Code if it meets
    certain requirements concerning its income and assets, as well
    as if it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to
    its stockholders and will not be subject to U.S. federal
    income taxes if it distributes at least 100% of its income.
    Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes
    of the REIT. UDR is subject to certain state and local excise or
    franchise taxes, for which provision has been made. If we fail
    to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, our taxable income
    will be subject to United States Federal income tax at regular
    corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum
    tax). Even if we qualify

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local income
    taxes and to United States Federal income tax. We also will be
    required to pay a 100% tax on non-arms length transactions
    between us and a taxable REIT subsidiary and on any net income
    from sales of property that the IRS successfully asserts was
    property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course.

The differences between net income available to common
    stockholders for financial reporting purposes and taxable income
    before dividend deductions relate primarily to temporary
    differences, principally real estate depreciation and the tax
    deferral of certain gains on property sales. The differences in
    depreciation result from differences in the book and tax basis
    of certain real estate assets and the differences in the methods
    of depreciation and lives of the real estate assets.

Consolidation
    of development partnerships

UDR adopted FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46,
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” as
    required, effective March 31, 2004. The adoption required
    the consolidation of all previously unconsolidated development
    projects, in which UDR was deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
    FIN No. 46 requires the Company to consolidate the
    assets, liabilities and results of operations of the activities
    of a variable interest entity, for which the Company includes
    only its development partnerships, if the Company is the primary
    beneficiary of the partnership. The primary beneficiary is the
    partner that is entitled to receive a majority of the
    entity’s residual returns

and/or

is
    subject to a majority of the risk of loss from such
    entity’s activities. As of December 31, 2006, UDR was
    the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidated, its
    three development partnerships.

Impact
    of recently issued accounting pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” This
    interpretation requires that income tax positions recognized in
    an entity’s tax returns have a more-likely-than-not chance
    of being sustained prior to recording the related tax benefit in
    the financial statements. Tax benefits would be derecognized if
    information became available which indicated that it was
    more-likely-than-not that the position would not be sustained.
    UDR will adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2007. The Company has substantially completed its
    analysis of the interpretation and does not expect it to have a
    material impact on its financial position.

REAL
    ESTATE OWNED

UDR operates in 33 markets dispersed throughout 16 states.
    At December 31, 2006, our largest apartment market was
    Orange County, California, where we owned 12% of our apartment
    homes, based upon carrying value. Excluding Orange County,
    California, UDR did not own more than 8% of its apartment homes
    in any one market, based upon carrying value.

INCOME
    FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

UDR adopted FASB Statement No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”
    (FAS 144) as of January 1, 2002. FAS 144
    requires, among other things, that the primary assets and
    liabilities and the results of operations of UDR’s real
    properties which have been sold subsequent to January 1,
    2005, or are held for disposition subsequent to January 1,
    2005, be classified as discontinued operations and segregated in
    UDR’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Balance
    Sheets. Properties classified as real estate held for
    disposition generally represent properties that are actively
    marketed or contracted for sale which are expected to close
    within the next twelve months.

For purposes of these financial statements, FAS 144 results
    in the presentation of the primary assets and liabilities and
    the net operating results of those properties sold or classified
    as held for disposition through December 31, 2006, as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented. The adoption
    of FAS 144 does not have an impact on net income available
    to common stockholders. FAS 144 only results in the
    reclassification of the operating results of all properties sold
    or classified as held for disposition through December 31,
    2006 within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, and the
    reclassification of the assets and liabilities within the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2006 and
    2005.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, UDR sold 24
    communities and 384 condominiums from four communities with a
    total of 612 condominiums. We recognized gains for financial
    reporting purposes of $148.6 million on these sales. At
    December 31, 2006, UDR had two communities with a net book
    value of $18.3 million, one community with a total of 320
    condominiums and a net book value of $19.0 million, one
    commercial unit with a net book value of $0.4 million, and
    one parcel of land with a net book value of $4.1 million
    included in real estate held for disposition. During 2005, UDR
    sold 22 communities, 240 condominiums from five communities with
    a total of 648 condominiums, and one parcel of land. We
    recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $139.7 million on these sales. In conjunction with the sale
    of ten communities in July 2005, we received short-term notes
    for $124.7 million that bear interest at 6.75% and had
    maturities ranging from September 2005 to July 2006. As of
    December 31, 2006, all of the notes receivable had matured
    and had been repaid. We recognized previously deferred gains for
    financial reporting

purposes of $6.4 million for the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2006. During 2004, UDR sold 19 communities, 24
    condominiums from a community of 36 condominiums, and one parcel
    of land. The results of operations for these properties and the
    interest expense associated with the secured debt on these
    properties are classified on the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations in the line item entitled “Income from

    to certain adjustment provisions. The capped call transaction
    combines a purchased call option with a strike price of $37.548
    with a written call option with a strike price of $43.806. These
    transactions have no effect on the terms of the
    3.625% convertible senior notes and are intended to reduce
    the potential dilution upon future conversion of the
    3.625% convertible senior notes by effectively increasing
    the initial conversion price to $43.806 per share,
    representing a 40% conversion premium. The net cost of
    $12.6 million of the capped call transaction was included
    in stockholders’ equity.

Prior to December 15, 2030, upon the occurrence of
    specified events, the notes will be convertible at the option of
    the holder into cash and, in certain circumstances, shares of
    UDR’s common stock at an initial conversion rate of
    35.2988 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which
    equates to an initial conversion price of approximately
    $28.33 per share). On or after December 15, 2030, the
    notes will be convertible at any time prior to the second
    business day prior to maturity at the option of the holder into
    cash and, in certain circumstances, shares of UDR’s common
    stock at the above initial conversion rate. The initial
    conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain

Dividend
    Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

UDR’s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the
    “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows common and preferred
    stockholders the opportunity to purchase, through the
    reinvestment of cash dividends, additional shares of UDR’s
    common stock. As of December 31, 2006,
    9,893,700 shares of common stock had been issued under the
    Stock Purchase Plan. Shares in the amount of 15,106,300 were
    reserved for further issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan as

Restricted
    Stock Awards

UDR’s 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
    authorizes the grant of restricted stock awards to employees,
    officers, consultants, and directors of UDR. Compensation
    expense is recorded over the vesting period and is based upon
    the value of the common stock on the date of issuance. For the
    years ended

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized
    $4.5 million, $3.2 million, and $2.7 million,
    respectively, of compensation expense related to the
    amortization of restricted stock. As of December 31, 2006,
    1,268,448 shares of restricted stock have been issued under
    the LTIP.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

UDR’s First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement is
    intended to protect long-term interests of stockholders in the
    event of an unsolicited, coercive or unfair attempt to take over
    UDR. The plan authorized a dividend of one Preferred Share
    Purchase Right (the “Rights”) on each share of common
    stock outstanding. Each Right, which is not currently
    exercisable, will entitle the holder to purchase 1/1000 of a
    share of a new series of UDR’s preferred stock, designated
    as Series C Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred
    Stock, at a price to be determined upon the occurrence of the
    event, and for which the holder must be paid $45 should the
    takeover occur. Under the Plan, the Rights will be exercisable
    if a person or group acquires more than 15% of UDR’s common
    stock or announces a tender offer that would result in the
    ownership of 15% of UDR’s common stock.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

The following estimated fair values of financial instruments
    were determined by UDR using available market information and
    appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is
    necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair
    values. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not
    necessarily indicative of the amounts UDR would realize on the
    disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different
    market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a
    material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The
    carrying amounts and estimated fair value of UDR’s
    financial instruments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, are
    summarized as follows

(dollars in thousands)

The following methods and assumptions were used by UDR in
    estimating fair values.

Cash
    equivalents

The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Notes
    receivable

At December 31, 2006, UDR has a promissory note in the
    principal amount of $1.5 million that is due in February
    2016. The note was received in connection with our investment in
    the development of an online leasing software and bears interest
    at 10.0%. In July 2006, UDR received a promissory note in the
    amount of $4.0 million that became due in January 2007.
    This note was received in connection with a joint venture
    project and bears interest at 6.8%. The carrying amount of these
    notes receivable approximate their fair value.

In July 2005, UDR received short-term notes in the principal
    amount of $124.7 million that bear interest at 6.75% and
    had maturities ranging from September 2005 to July 2006. The
    notes were received in conjunction with the sale of ten
    communities. As of December 31, 2006, all of the notes
    receivable had matured and had been repaid. We recognized
    previously deferred gains for financial reporting purposes of
    $6.4 million during 2006.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In June 2003, UDR received a promissory note in the principal
    amount of $5 million that is due October 2011. The note was
    received in connection with one of our acquisitions and bears
    interest of 9.0% that is payable in annual installments. The
    carrying amount of this note receivable approximates its fair
    value.

Secured
    and unsecured debt

Estimated fair value is based on mortgage rates, tax-exempt bond
    rates, and corporate unsecured debt rates believed to be
    available to UDR for the issuance of debt with similar terms and
    remaining lives. The carrying amount of UDR’s variable rate
    secured debt approximates fair value as of December 31,
    2006 and 2005. The carrying amounts of UDR’s borrowings
    under variable rate unsecured debt arrangements, short-term
    revolving credit agreements, and lines of credit, approximate
    their fair values as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

Profit
    Sharing Plan

Our Profit Sharing Plan (the “Plan”) is a defined
    contribution plan covering all eligible full-time employees.
    Under the Plan, UDR makes discretionary profit sharing and
    matching contributions to the Plan as determined by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Aggregate
    provisions for contributions, both matching and discretionary,
    which are included in UDR’s Consolidated Statements of
    Operations for the three years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005, and 2004 were $0.7 million, $0.6 million, and
    $0.6 million, respectively.

Stock
    Option Plan

In May 2001, the stockholders of UDR approved the 1999 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”), which supersedes the 1985
    Stock Option Plan. With the approval of the LTIP, no additional
    grants will be made under the 1985 Stock Option Plan. The LTIP
    authorizes the granting of awards which may take the form of
    options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation
    rights, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, other
    stock-based awards, and any other right or interest relating to
    common stock or cash. The Board of Directors reserved
    4 million shares for issuance upon the grant or exercise of
    awards under the LTIP. The LTIP generally provides, among other
    things, that options are granted at exercise prices not lower
    than the market value of the shares on the date of grant and
    that options granted must be exercised within ten years. The
    maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued subject to
    incentive stock options is 4 million shares. Shares under
    options that expire or are cancelable are available for
    subsequent grant.

UDR adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for
    share-based payments effective January 1, 2004, using the
    prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148

,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure.” UDR adopted
    Statement 123(R) on January 1, 2006, and has continued
    to use the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the value of
    stock options granted to employees, which have not been granted
    since 2002. Statement 123(R) must be applied not only to
    new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully
    vested on the effective date (as of January 1, 2006, there
    were no unvested stock options). UDR adopted Statement 123
    using the modified prospective transition method (which applied
    only to awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption
    date). The adoption of



UNITED
    DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

the provisions of Statement 123(R) did not have a material

Contingencies

Series C
    Out-Performance Program

In May 2005, the stockholders of UDR approved a new
    Out-Performance Program and the first series of new
    Out-Performance Partnership Shares under the program are the
    Series C Out-Performance Units (the “Series C
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers and
    other key employees of UDR (the “Series C
    Participants”) were given the opportunity to purchase
    interests in UDR Out-Performance III, LLC, a Delaware
    limited liability company (the “Series C LLC”),
    the only asset of which is a special class of partnership units
    of the Operating Partnership (“Series C
    Out-Performance Partnership Shares” or “Series C
    OPPSs”) . The purchase price for the Series C OPPSs
    was determined by the Compensation Committee of UDR’s board
    of directors to be $750,000, assuming 100% participation, and
    was based upon the advice of an independent valuation expert.
    UDR’s performance for the Series C Program will be
    measured over the

36-month

period from June 1, 2005 to May 30, 2008.

The Series C Program is designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period is at least the
    equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized
    (“Minimum Return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if UDR’s
    cumulative total return satisfies these criteria, the
    Series C LLC as holder of the Series C OPPSs will
    receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series C
    Participants as holders of interests in the Series C
    LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from
    the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and
    allocations that would be received on the number of
    OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of UDR’s common stock over the measurement period
    exceeds the Minimum Return (such excess being the “Excess
    Return”);

ii. multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by UDR’s
    market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares
    outstanding over the

36-month

period, including common stock, common stock equivalents and
    OP Units); and

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

iii. dividing the number obtained in clause (ii) by
    the market value of one share of UDR’s common stock on the
    valuation date, computed as the volume-weighted average price
    per day of common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
    preceding the valuation date.

For the Series C OPPSs, the number determined pursuant to
    (ii) above is capped at 1% of market capitalization.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total return of
    UDR’s common stock does not meet the Minimum Return, then
    the Series C Participants will forfeit their entire initial
    investment.

Based on the results through December 31, 2006, 313,145
    Series C OPPSs would have been issued had the Program
    terminated on that date. However, since the ultimate
    determination of Series C OPPSs to be issued will not occur
    until May 30, 2008, and the number of Series C OPPSs
    is determinable only upon future events, the financial
    statements do not reflect any impact for these events.
    Accordingly, the contingently issuable Series C OPPSs will
    only be included in basic earnings per share after the
    measurement period has ended and the applicable hurdle has been
    met. Furthermore, the Series C OPPSs will only be included
    in common stock and common stock equivalents in the calculation
    of diluted earnings per share after the measurement period has
    ended and the hurdle has been met at the end of the reporting
    period (if any), assuming the measurement period ended at the
    end of the reporting period.

Series D
    Out-Performance Program

In February 2006, the board of directors of UDR approved the
    Series D Out-Performance Program (the “Series D
    Program”) pursuant to which certain executive officers and
    other key employees of UDR (the “Series D
    Participants”) were given the opportunity to purchase
    interests in UDR Out-Performance IV, LLC, a Delaware limited
    liability company (the “Series D LLC”), the only
    asset of which is a special class of partnership units of the
    Operating Partnership (“Series D Out-Performance
    Partnership Shares” or “Series D OPPSs”) .
    The Series D Program is part of the New Out-Performance
    Program approved by UDR’s stockholders in May 2005. The
    Series D LLC has agreed to sell 830,000 membership units to
    members of UDR’s senior management at a price of
    $1.00 per unit. The aggregate purchase price of $830,000
    for the Series D OPPSs, assuming 100% participation, is
    based upon the advice of an independent valuation expert. The
    Series D Program will measure the cumulative total return
    on our common stock over the

36-month

period beginning January 1, 2006 and ending
    December 31, 2008.

The Series D Program is designed to provide participants
    with the possibility of substantial returns on their investment
    if the cumulative total return on UDR’s common stock, as
    measured by the cumulative amount of dividends paid plus share
    price appreciation during the measurement period is at least the
    equivalent of a 36% total return, or 12% annualized
    (“Minimum Return”).

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if UDR’s
    cumulative total return satisfies these criteria, the
    Series D LLC as holder of the Series D OPPSs will
    receive (for the indirect benefit of the Series D
    Participants as holders of interests in the Series D
    LLC) distributions and allocations of income and loss from
    the Operating Partnership equal to the distributions and
    allocations that would be received on the number of
    OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the cumulative total
    return of UDR’s common stock over the measurement period
    exceeds the Minimum Return (such excess being the “Excess
    Return”);

ii. multiplying 2% of the Excess Return by UDR’s
    market capitalization (defined as the average number of shares
    outstanding over the

36-month

period, including common stock, OP Units, common stock
    equivalents and OP Units); and

Litigation
    and Legal Matters

UDR is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising
    in the ordinary course of business. UDR cannot determine the
    ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and
    claims at this time. UDR believes that such liability, to the
    extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, will not
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flow.

INDUSTRY
    SEGMENTS

UDR owns and operates multifamily apartment communities
    throughout the United States that generate rental and other
    property related income through the leasing of apartment homes
    to a diverse base of tenants. UDR separately evaluates the
    performance of each of its apartment communities. However,
    because each of the apartment communities has similar economic
    characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants, the
    apartment communities have been aggregated into a single
    apartment communities segment. All segment disclosure is
    included in or can be derived from UDR’s consolidated
    financial statements.

There are no tenants that contributed 10% or more of UDR’s
    total revenues during 2006, 2005, or 2004.
