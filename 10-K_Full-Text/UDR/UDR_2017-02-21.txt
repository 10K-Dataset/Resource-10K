EXPLANATORY NOTE

This Report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2016

of UDR, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, of which UDR, Inc. is the parent company and sole general partner. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “UDR” or “UDR, Inc.” refer collectively to UDR, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, including United Dominion Realty, L.P. and UDR Lighthouse DownREIT L.P. (the “DownREIT Partnership”), both Delaware limited partnerships of which UDR is the sole general partner. Unless the context otherwise requires, the references in this Report to the “Operating Partnership” or the “OP” refer to United Dominion Realty, L.P., together with its consolidated subsidiaries. “Common stock” refers to the common stock of UDR and “stockholders” means the holders of shares of UDR’s common stock and preferred stock. The limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership are referred to as “OP Units” and “DownREIT Units” respectively, and the holders of the OP Units and DownREIT Units are referred to as “unitholders.” This combined Form 10-K is being filed separately by UDR and the Operating Partnership.

There are a number of differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in our disclosure in this Report. UDR is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), whose most significant asset is its ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. UDR also conducts business through other subsidiaries, including its taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). UDR acts as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, holds interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures, owns and operates properties, issues securities from time to time and guarantees debt of certain of our subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of a substantial portion of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity securities. The Operating Partnership has guaranteed certain outstanding debt of UDR.

As of

December 31, 2016

, UDR owned

110,883

units (100%) of the general partnership interests of the Operating Partnership and

174,119,201

units (or approximately

95.1%

)

of the limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. UDR conducts a substantial amount of its business and holds a substantial amount of its assets through the Operating Partnership, and, by virtue of its ownership of the OP Units and being the Operating Partnership’s sole general partner, UDR has the ability to control all of the day-to-day operations of the Operating Partnership. Separate financial statements and accompanying notes, as well as separate discussions under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchasers of Equity Securities” and “Control and Procedures” are provided for each of UDR and the Operating Partnership. In addition, certain disclosures in “Business” are separated by entity to the extent that the discussion relates to UDR’s business outside of the Operating Partnership.

Item 1. BUSINESS

General

UDR is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, disposes of and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets throughout the United States. The high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. At

December 31, 2016

, our consolidated real estate portfolio included


communities located in


markets, with a total of

39,454

completed apartment homes, which are held directly or through our subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. In addition, we have an ownership interest in


communities containing

6,849

apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company was developing

two

wholly-owned communities with

1,101

apartment homes, none of which have been completed, and four unconsolidated joint venture communities with 1,069 apartment homes, 99 of which have been completed.

At

December 31, 2016

, the Operating Partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio included


communities located in


markets, with a total of

16,698

completed apartment homes. The Operating Partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the United States. During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, revenues of the Operating Partnership represented approximately

43%

of our total rental revenues.

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this Report as the “Code.” To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. In


, we declared total distributions of

$1.18

per common share and paid dividends of

$1.1625

per common share.

UDR was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. The Operating Partnership is the successor-in-interest to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. The Operating Partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a Delaware limited partnership. Our corporate offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive, Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. Our website is

www.udr.com

. The information contained on our website, including any information referred to in this Report as being available on our website, is not a part of or incorporated into this Report.

As of

February 17, 2017

, we had 1,550 full-time associates and 37 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by UDR.

Reporting Segments

We report in two segments:

Same-Store Communities

and

Non-Mature Communities/Other

.

Our S

ame-Store Communities

segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2015

, and held as of

December 31, 2016

. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for disposition at year end. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.


Our

Non-Mature Communities/Other

segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in

Same-Store Communities,

including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. For additional information regarding our operating segments, see Note 16,

Reportable Segments

, in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report and Note 11,

Reportable Segments

, in the Notes to the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Business Objectives

Our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. To achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:

•

own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders;

•

manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities;

•

empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively;

•

measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and

•

manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of liquidity, earnings and dividends.


Highlights

•

In July 2016, the Company marked its 44th year as a REIT and, in October 2016, paid its 176th consecutive quarterly dividend. The Company’s annualized declared 2016 dividend of

$1.18

represented a 6.3% increase over the previous year.

Our Strategies and Vision

Our vision is to be the innovative multifamily public REIT of choice. Our strategic priorities are:

1. Strengthen the Quality of Our Diversified Portfolio

2. Flexible/Strong Balance Sheet

3. Increase Cash Flow to Support Dividend Growth through Operating Excellence

4. A Great Place to Work and Live

Quality of Our Diversified Portfolio

We are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. Portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider:

•

whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market;

•

population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;

•

geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale;

•

construction quality, condition and design of the property;

•

current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;

•

the ability of the property’s projected cash flows to exceed our cost of capital;

•

potential for capital appreciation of the property;

•

ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment;

•

terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;

•

occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity;

•

prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and

•

competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area.

We regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. Factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include:

•

current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset;

•

potential increases in new construction in the market area;

•

areas with low job growth prospects;

•

markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and

•

operating efficiencies.

The following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our year-end ownership position of the Operating Partnership for the past five years (

dollars in thousands

):

(a)   Includes 3,107 homes deconsolidated in 2015 upon contribution of communities by the Operating Partnership to the DownREIT Partnership.

Development Activities

Our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. Demographic trends, economic drivers, and how multifamily fundamentals/valuations have trended over the long-term govern our review process on where to allocate development capital. At

December 31, 2016

, our development pipeline included two wholly-owned communities located in Huntington Beach, California and Boston, Massachusetts with

1,101

homes and a budget of

$708.5 million

, in which we have a carrying value of

$342.3 million

.

Redevelopment Activities

Our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. During


, we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. At

December 31, 2016

, the Company was redeveloping


apartment homes,


of which have been completed, at three wholly-owned communities located in San Francisco, California, Austin, Texas, and Dallas, Texas. During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, we incurred

$21.3 million

in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings.

Joint Venture and Partnership Activities

We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.

Balance Sheet Management

We maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. We have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate.

Financing Activities

As part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities.

Operational Excellence, Cash Flow and Dividend Growth

Investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. Our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal.


As a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents’ satisfaction improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. Web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes.

Operating Partnership Strategies and Vision

The Operating Partnership’s long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology. As a result, the Operating Partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in New York, New York; San Francisco Bay Area, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Metropolitan D.C. over the past years. Prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. Markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth, household income, low single-family home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing, which are key drivers to strong rental growth.

Competitive Conditions

Competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. Some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. Competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors, including sub-market supply and demand. In addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. These competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do.

We believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:

•

a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise;

•

scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our Internet marketing efforts;

•

access to sources of capital;

•

geographic diversification with a presence in


markets across the country; and

•

significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert.

Moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. We believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside.

Communities

At

December 31, 2016

, our consolidated real estate portfolio included


communities with a total of

39,454

completed apartment homes, which included the Operating Partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of


communities with a total of

16,698

completed apartment homes. The overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents.

At

December 31, 2016

, the Company was developing two wholly-owned communities with 1,101 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. The communities being developed are not part of the Operating Partnership’s real estate portfolio.

At

December 31, 2016

, the Company was redeveloping 425 apartment homes, 351 of which have been completed, at three wholly-owned communities. One of these communities under redevelopment is held by the Operating Partnership.

Same-Store Community Comparison

We believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our

Same-Store Communities’

NOI, which is total rental revenue, less rental and other operating expenses excluding property


management. Our

Same-Store Community

population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, our Same-Store NOI

increase

d by

$31.4 million

compared to the prior year. Our

Same-Store Community

properties provided

76.9%

of our total NOI for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. The increase in NOI for the

31,930

Same-Store apartment homes, or 80.9% of our portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the Operating Partnership’s Same-Store NOI increased by $15.8 million compared to the prior year. The Operating Partnership’s

Same-Store Community

properties provided

79.9%

of its total NOI for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. The increase in NOI for the

14,001

Same-Store apartment homes, or 83.8% of the Operating Partnership’s portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates and a decrease in operating expenses.

Revenue growth in


may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents.

Tax Matters

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, UDR must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. Provided we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

We may utilize our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) to engage in activities that REITs may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. Our TRS generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

The Operating Partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. However, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the Operating Partnership are incurred at the entity level.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, the majority of our apartment leases have terms of 12 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

Environmental Matters

Various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. Such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. The failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party.

To date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have a property management plan for hazardous materials. As part of the plan, Phase I environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. In addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks


involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. In addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. Future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

There are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the Company and the Operating Partnership. The following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this Report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. Forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law.

Risks Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Our Operations

Unfavorable Apartment Market and Economic Conditions Could Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels, Rental Revenues and the Value of Our Real Estate Assets.

Unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. Our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. Some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline. We would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to UDR’s stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. Factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others:

•

downturns in the global, national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment;

•

declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable;

•

government or builder incentives with respect to home ownership, making alternative housing options more attractive;

•

local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes;

•

declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;

•

changes in market rental rates;

•

our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms;

•

the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations;

•

declines in household formation; and

•

rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs.

We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Apartment Units as Leases Expire, or the Terms of Renewals or New Leases May Be Less Favorable Than Current Leases.

When our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. Even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. Furthermore, because the majority of our apartment leases have terms of 12 months or less, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. If residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase.


We Face Certain Risks Related to Our Retail and Commercial Space.

Certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties. The long term nature of our retail and commercial leases (generally five to ten years with market based renewal options) and the characteristics of many of our tenants (generally small and/or local businesses) may subject us to certain risks. The longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time if we do not accurately judge the potential increases in market rental rates. We may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates. Also, when leases for our retail or commercial space expire, the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the prior lease terms. Our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space. The presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. If our retail or commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy, they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

Risk of Inflation/Deflation.

Substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. The general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to UDR’s stockholders.

We Are Subject to Certain Risks Associated with Selling Apartment Communities, Which Could Limit Our Operational and Financial Flexibility.

We periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. Furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. These conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. We are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities, among others:

•

a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the “Code,” so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and

•

federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.

Competition Could Limit Our Ability to Lease Apartment Homes or Increase or Maintain Rents.

Our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. Competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of Past or Future Acquisitions, and the Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel Successfully Could Create Inefficiencies.

We have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks, among others:

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;

•

even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the debt used to finance the acquisition;

•

even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may not complete the acquisition for a variety of reasons after incurring certain acquisition-related costs;

•

we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete;


•

when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability;

•

the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and

•

we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability.

Competition Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Acquire Properties.

In the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment REITs, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns.

Development and Construction Risks Could Impact Our Profitability.

In the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. Development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. Our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks, among others:

•

we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all, which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments;

•

we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations;

•

yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected;

•

if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited;

•

we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;

•

we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs;

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and

•

when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance.

In some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. We may experience similar cost increases in the future. Our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability.

Bankruptcy or Defaults of Our Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Our Performance.

We have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. As a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.


Property Ownership Through Partnerships and Joint Ventures May Limit Our Ability to Act Exclusively in Our Interest.

We have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. We currently have 16 active joint ventures and partnerships, including our participating loan investment and preferred equity investment, with a total equity investment of

$827.0 million

. We could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. Moreover, our partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. In some instances, our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. Also, our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. In general, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners’ interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner’s interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process.

We are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our partner, including (i) a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture.

We may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs.

In connection with certain property acquisitions, we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers, and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions. These agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance. However, subject to certain conditions, we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers.

We Could Incur Significant Insurance Costs and Some Potential Losses May Not Be Adequately Covered by Insurance.

We have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily industry. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. In addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage.

If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. Material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. If one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions.

As a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. Insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which are generally outside of our control. We insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. The financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. Their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. In addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit Our Growth.

We have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. Entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. These risks include, among others:

•

inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies;

•

inability to hire and retain key personnel;


•

lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and

•

inability to achieve budgeted financial results.

Potential Liability for Environmental Contamination Could Result in Substantial Costs.

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. In addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property.

In addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. Noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. Changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations.

As the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. For example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or ACM. Environmental, health and safety laws require that ACM be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements.

These requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if ACM would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. In addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to ACM or releases of ACM into the environment.

We cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our Properties May Contain or Develop Harmful Mold or Suffer from Other Indoor Air Quality Issues, Which Could Lead to Liability for Adverse Health Effects or Property Damage or Cost for Remediation.

When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.

Compliance or Failure to Comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or Other Safety Regulations and Requirements Could Result in Substantial Costs.

The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. From time to time, claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the Americans with Disabilities Act. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.


Compliance with or Changes in Real Estate Tax and Other Laws and Regulations Could Adversely Affect Our Funds from Operations and Our Ability to Make Distributions to Stockholders.

We are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. Generally, we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes to tenants under leases. These costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws and regulations regulating housing, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders.

Risk of Damage from Catastrophic Weather and Natural Events and Potential Climate Change.

Certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. These adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

To the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas. Should the impact of such climate change be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Risk of Earthquake Damage.

Some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. We may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. As a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical.

Risk of Accidental Death Due to Fire, Natural Disasters or Other Hazards.

The accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Actual or Threatened Terrorist Attacks May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business and Operating Results and Could Decrease the Value of Our Assets.

Actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. Further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. In addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Mezzanine Loan Assets Involve Greater Risks of Loss than Senior Loans Secured by Income-producing Properties.

We may acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. Mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. In the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. As a result, we may not recover some of or all our


initial expenditure. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal.

Risk Related to Preferred Equity Investments.

In the future we may make preferred equity investments in corporations, limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or managing real property. With preferred equity investments, our interest in a particular entity will be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity. Generally, we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity, and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors, managers, general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations. Although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives, the owner of the majority of the voting interests may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests. Further, if the owner of the majority of the voting interests were to fail to invest capital in the entity, we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment. The owner of the majority of the voting interests may fail to develop or operate the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all. In addition, we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest. In the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent, we may lose our entire investment in the entity.

We May Experience a Decline in the Fair Value of Our Assets and Be Forced to Recognize Impairment Charges, Which Could Materially and Adversely Impact Our Financial Condition, Liquidity and Results of Operations and the Market Price of UDR

’

s Common Stock.

A decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the United States (“GAAP”), if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. If we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of UDR’s common stock.

Any Material Weaknesses Identified in Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Could Have an Adverse Effect on UDR

’

s Stock Price.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on UDR’s stock price.

Our Business and Operations Would Suffer in the Event of System Failures or Breaches in Data Security.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems and systems maintained by third party vendors are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and networks and systems maintained and controlled by third party vendors, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and keeping of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we take steps, and generally require third party vendors to take steps, to protect the security of the data maintained in our and their information systems, it is possible that our or their security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our or third party vendors’ information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.

Social Media Presents Risks.

The use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure. Negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation. Further, employees or others may disclose non-public information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As social media evolves we will be presented with new and risks and challenges.


Our Success Depends on Our Senior Management.

Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. We may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in U.S. Accounting Standards May Materially and Adversely Affect Our Reported Results of Operations.

Accounting for public companies in the United States is in accordance with GAAP, which is established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the SEC as authoritative for publicly held companies. Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the FASB and the SEC, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for U.S. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financings

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt Financing and Create Refinancing Risk.

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. Sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy UDR’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. We are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. In addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to UDR’s stockholders.

Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could Impair Debt Service Payments and Distributions to Stockholders.

If our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to UDR’s stockholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities:

•

the national and local economies;

•

local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes;

•

tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located;

•

our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance;

•

rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities;

•

competition from other apartment communities;

•

changes in interest rates and the availability of financing;

•

changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and

•

changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing.

Expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.


Changing Interest Rates Could Increase Interest Costs and Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow and the Market Price of Our Securities.

We currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt, including commercial paper, at rates that vary with market interest rates. As of

December 31, 2016

, UDR had approximately

$432.0 million

of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately

12.7%

of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Operating Partnership had approximately

$190.6 million

of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately

43.8%

of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. In addition, borrowings under our commercial paper program bear interest at variable rates. An increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt, including commercial paper. Accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. The effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. In addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of UDR’s common and preferred stock and debt securities.

Our Debt Level May Be Increased.

Our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt.

Financing May Not Be Available and Could Be Dilutive.

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit, construction loans and other forms of secured debt, commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. We and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time, including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets, for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the Basel III capital requirements and the associated “High Volatility Commercial Real Estate” designation, which has adversely impacted the availability of loans, including construction loans and the interest rate thereon. Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. If we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted.

Failure To Maintain Our Current Credit Ratings Could Adversely Affect Our Cost of Funds, Related Margins, Liquidity, and Access to Capital Markets.

Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt, commercial paper program and preferred stock. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets, including our ability to access the commercial paper market.

Disruptions in Financial Markets May Adversely Impact Availability and Cost of Credit and Have Other Adverse Effects on Us and the Market Price of UDR

’

s Stock.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. During the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it, the United States stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably. Those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing, such as the commercial paper market. Any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of UDR’s common stock. If we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. A prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. These events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of UDR’s common or preferred stock.

A Change in U.S. Government Policy or Support Regarding Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Business.

While in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing market including potential purchasers of our properties. Potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the U.S. have been suggested, including options that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are able to


provide, limitations on the loans that the agencies may make, which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties, or the phase out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While we believe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally, it may adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and, as a result, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

The Soundness of Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us.

We have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. In the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be Ineffective and May Result in Material Charges.

From time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. If the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. Furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. In addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.

Risks Related to Tax Laws

We Would Incur Adverse Tax Consequences if UDR Failed to Qualify as a REIT.

UDR has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. Our qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. In addition, U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or adversely affect UDR’s stockholders.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to UDR’s stockholders in computing our taxable income. Also, unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a REIT. The additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to UDR’s stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to UDR’s stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

Certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as REITs under the Code, and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year.

Dividends Paid By REITs Generally Do Not Qualify for Reduced Tax Rates.

In general, the maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual U.S. stockholders is 20%. Unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a REIT, our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates.

UDR May Conduct a Portion of Our Business Through Taxable REIT Subsidiaries, Which are Subject to Certain Tax Risks.

We have established several taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite UDR’s qualification as a REIT, its taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. In addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally do


not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. While we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not adversely affect our REIT qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable REIT subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected.

REIT Distribution Requirements Limit Our Available Cash.

As a REIT, UDR is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to UDR’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Code. However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code.

Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income, Resulting in a Penalty Tax on Gain Attributable to the Transaction.

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. If the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect UDR’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

Changes to the U.S. Federal Income Tax Laws, including the Enactment of Certain Proposed Tax Reform Measures, Could Have an Adverse Impact on Our Business and Financial Results.

Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws are proposed regularly. Legislative and regulatory changes may be more likely in the 115

th

Congress because the Presidency and such Congress will be controlled by the same political party and significant reform of the Code has been described publicly as a legislative priority.  Additionally, the REIT rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department, which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes.  If enacted, certain such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.  For example, certain proposals set forth in President Trump’s administration and House Republican tax plans could reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a REIT unless accompanied by responsive changes to the REIT rules.  These proposals include: the lowering of income tax rates on individuals and corporations, which could ease the burden of double taxation on corporate dividends and make the single level of taxation on REIT distributions relatively less attractive; allowing the expensing of capital expenditures, which could result in the bunching of taxable income and required distributions for REITs; and further limiting or eliminating the deductibility of interest expense, which could disrupt the real estate market and could increase the amount of REIT taxable income that must be distributed as dividends to shareholders.

We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued, nor is the long-term impact of proposed tax reforms on the real estate investment industry or REITs clear.  Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential changes to the U.S. federal tax laws on an investment in our shares.

We May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in State and Local Tax Laws and May Become Subject to Tax Audits from Time to Time.

As discussed in the risk factors above, because UDR is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to UDR’s stockholders. In the normal course of business, we or our affiliates (including entities through which we own real estate) may also become subject to federal, state or local tax audits. If we (or such entities) become subject to federal, state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.


The Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership Intend to Qualify as Partnerships, But Cannot Guarantee That They Will Qualify.

The Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes, and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes. If classified as  partnerships, the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability. However, the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were “publicly traded partnerships,” unless at least 90% of their income was qualifying income as defined in the Code. A “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). Although neither the Operating Partnership’s nor the DownREIT Partnership’s partnership units are traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption rights of their limited partners, the Operating Partnership’s and DownREIT Partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations. Qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. The income requirements applicable to REITs and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. The Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. If the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, they would incur substantial tax liabilities, and UDR would then fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired.

Qualifying as a REIT Involves Highly Technical and Complex Provisions of the Code.

Our qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the REIT income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. In addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Ownership of UDR’s Stock

Changes in Market Conditions and Volatility of Stock Prices Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of UDR

’

s Common Stock.

The stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), on which we list UDR’s common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of UDR’s common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in UDR’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition to the risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of UDR’s common stock, including:

•

general market and economic conditions;

•

actual or anticipated variations in UDR’s quarterly operating results or dividends or UDR’s payment of dividends in shares of UDR’s stock;

•

changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•

difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt;

•

decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations;

•

changes in market valuations of similar companies;

•

publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;

•

the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies);


•

general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of UDR’s stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;

•

a change in analyst ratings;

•

additions or departures of key management personnel;

•

adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;

•

speculation in the press or investment community;

•

terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which UDR’s securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending;

•

failure to qualify as a REIT;

•

strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;

•

failure to satisfy listing requirements of the NYSE;

•

governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and

•

the issuance of additional shares of UDR’s common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under UDR’s at-the-market equity distribution program.

Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of shares of UDR’s common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects.

We May Change the Dividend Policy for UDR

’

s Common Stock in the Future.

The decision to declare and pay dividends on UDR’s common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. Any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of UDR’s common stock.

Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in UDR

’

s Stockholders

’

Best Interests.

Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to various Maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our Company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in UDR’s stockholders’ best interests. The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of UDR’s stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. Maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote.

Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations on the Ability of UDR

’

s Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control of Our Company Restricts the Transferability of UDR

’

s Stock and May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to UDR

’

s Stockholders.

One of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the Code, during the last half of any taxable year. Our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to UDR’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other REIT ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten REIT status. These restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. Absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of UDR’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the Code for REITs, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of


such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. These provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for UDR’s stockholders or might otherwise be in UDR’s stockholders’ best interests.

PART II

Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

UDR, Inc.:

Common Stock

UDR, Inc.’s common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “UDR” since May 7, 1990. The following tables set forth the quarterly high and low sale prices per common share reported on the NYSE for each quarter of the last two fiscal years. Distribution information for common stock reflects distributions declared per share for each calendar quarter and paid at the end of the following month.

On

February 17, 2017

, the closing sale price of our common stock was $35.59 per share on the NYSE, and there were

3,982 holders of record of the

267,370,704

outstanding shares of our common stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax purposes, approximately 61% of the distributions for


represented ordinary income, 27% represented long-term capital gain, and 12% represented unrecaptured section 1250 gain.

UDR pays regular quarterly distributions to holders of its common stock. Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our actual funds from operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, and other factors.

Series E Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series E”) has no stated par value and a liquidation preference of

$16.61

per share. Subject to certain adjustments and conditions, each share of the Series E is convertible at any time and from time to time at the holder’s option into

1.083

shares of our common stock. The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for the election of directors or for any other purpose on which the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or any mandatory redemption. In connection with a special dividend (declared on November 5, 2008), the Company reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Series E additional shares of common stock to which a holder of the Series E would have received if the holder had converted the Series E immediately prior to the record date for this special dividend.

Distributions declared on the Series E for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


were

$1.33

per share or $0.3322 per quarter. The Series E is not listed on any exchange. At

December 31, 2016

, a total of

2,796,903

shares of the Series E were outstanding.

Series F Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue up to

20,000,000

shares of our Series F Preferred Stock (“Series F”). The Series F may be purchased by holders of our Operating Partnership Units, or OP Units, described below under “Operating Partnership Units,” at a purchase price of

$0.0001

per share. OP unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and purchase one share of the Series F for each OP Unit held. In connection with the acquisition of properties from Home OP and the formation of the DownREIT Partnership in October 2015, we issued 13,988,313 Series F shares at $0.0001 per share to former limited partners of the Home OP, which had the right to subscribe for one share of Series F for each DownREIT Unit issued in connection with the acquisitions.

As of

December 31, 2016

, a total of

16,196,889

shares of the Series F were outstanding. Holders of the Series F are entitled to one vote for each share of the Series F they hold, voting together with the holders of our common stock, on each


matter submitted to a vote of security holders at a meeting of our stockholders. The Series F does not entitle its holders to any other rights, privileges or preferences.

Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

We have a Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under which holders of our common stock may elect to automatically reinvest their distributions and make additional cash payments to acquire additional shares of our common stock. Stockholders who do not participate in the plan continue to receive distributions as and when declared. As of

February 17, 2017

, there were approximately 2,159 participants in the plan.

United Dominion Realty, L.P.:

4.9%

were owned by non-affiliated limited partners. Under the terms of the Operating Partnership’s limited partnership agreement, the holders of OP Units have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the holder in exchange for a cash payment based on the market value of our common stock at the time of redemption. However, the Operating Partnership’s obligation to pay the cash amount is subject to the prior right of the Company to acquire such OP Units in exchange for either the cash amount or the number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of OP Units being redeemed.

During


, we issued a total of 4,685 shares of common stock upon redemption of OP Units.

Purchases of Equity Securities

In February 2006, UDR’s Board of Directors authorized a

10 million

share repurchase program. In January 2008, UDR’s Board of Directors authorized a new

15 million

share repurchase program. Under the two share repurchase programs, UDR may repurchase shares of our common stock in open market purchases, block purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. As reflected in the table below, no shares of common stock were repurchased under these programs during the quarter ended

December 31, 2016

.

This number reflects the amount of shares that were available for purchase under our

10 million

share repurchase program authorized in February 2006 and our

15 million

share repurchase program authorized in January 2008.

During the

three months ended

December 31, 2016

, certain of our employees surrendered shares of common stock owned by them to satisfy their statutory minimum federal and state tax obligations associated with the vesting of restricted shares of common stock issued under our 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”). The following table summarizes all of these repurchases during the three months ended

Comparison of Five-year Cumulative Total Returns

The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total returns for UDR common stock with the comparable cumulative return of the NAREIT Equity REIT Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index, the NAREIT Equity Apartment Index and the MSCI US REIT Index. The graph assumes that $100 was invested on

December 31, 2011

, in each of our common stock and the indices presented. Historical stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. The comparison assumes that all dividends are reinvested.

The performance graph and the related chart and text, are being furnished solely to accompany this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

pursuant to

Item 201(e)

of Regulation S-K, and are not being filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not to be incorporated by reference into any filing of ours, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.


Item 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following tables set forth selected consolidated financial and other information of UDR, Inc. and of the Operating Partnership as of and for each of the years in the five-year period ended

December 31, 2016

. The table should be read in conjunction with each of UDR, Inc.’s and the Operating Partnership’s respective consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included elsewhere in this Report.


(a)  Includes amounts classified as Held for Disposition, where applicable.

(b)  Funds from operations (“FFO”) is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests, unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s (“NAREIT”) definition issued in April 2002. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of a REIT’s operating performance. In the computation of FFO, diluted, if OP Units, DownREIT Units, unvested restricted stock, stock options, and the shares of Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive, they are included in the diluted share count.

Activities of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”)

include development and land entitlement. From time to time, we develop and subsequently sell a TRS property which results in a short-term use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional long-term investment in real estate for REITs. We believe that the inclusion of these TRS gains in FFO is consistent with the standards established by NAREIT as the short-term investment is incidental to our main business. TRS gains on sales, net of taxes, are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation.

We consider FFO a useful metric for investors as we use FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance, and believe that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

Forward-Looking Statements

This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning property acquisitions and dispositions, development activity and capital expenditures, capital raising activities, rent growth, occupancy, and rental expense growth. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “likely,” “will,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among other things, unfavorable changes in the apartment market, changing economic conditions, the impact of inflation/deflation on rental rates and property operating expenses, expectations concerning availability of capital and the stability of the capital markets, the impact of competition and competitive pricing, acquisitions, developments and redevelopments not achieving anticipated results, delays in completing developments, redevelopments and lease-ups on schedule, expectations on job growth, home affordability and demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing, expectations concerning development and redevelopment activities, expectations on occupancy levels and rental rates, expectations concerning the joint ventures with third parties, expectations that automation will help grow net operating income, and expectations on annualized net operating income.

The following factors, among others, could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements:

•

general economic conditions;

•

unfavorable changes in the apartment market and economic conditions that could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates;

•

the failure of acquisitions to achieve anticipated results;

•

possible difficulty in selling apartment communities;

•

competitive factors that may limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents;

•

insufficient cash flow that could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk;

•

failure to generate sufficient revenue, which could impair our debt service payments and distributions to stockholders;

•

development and construction risks that may impact our profitability;

•

potential damage from natural disasters, including hurricanes and other weather-related events, which could result in substantial costs to us;

•

risks from extraordinary losses for which we may not have insurance or adequate reserves;

•

uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insurance retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage;

•

delays in completing developments and lease-ups on schedule;

•

our failure to succeed in new markets;

•

changing interest rates, which could increase interest costs and affect the market price of our securities;

•

potential liability for environmental contamination, which could result in substantial costs to us;

•

the imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code in any taxable year;


•

our internal controls over financial reporting may not be considered effective which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, and in turn have an adverse effect on our stock price; and

•

changes in real estate laws, tax laws and other laws affecting our business.

A discussion of these and other factors affecting our business and prospects is set forth in Part I, Item 1A.

Risk Factors

. We encourage investors to review these risk factors.

Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore such statements included in this Report may not prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein and is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


of each of UDR, Inc. and United Domination Realty, L.P.

UDR, Inc.:

Business Overview

We are a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities. We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation. In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland. Our subsidiaries include the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “UDR” refer collectively to UDR, Inc., its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures.

At

December 31, 2016

, our consolidated real estate portfolio included


communities in


states plus the District of Columbia totaling

39,454

apartment homes, and our total real estate portfolio, inclusive of our unconsolidated communities, included an additional


communities with

6,849

apartment homes.

At

December 31, 2016

, the Company was developing

two

wholly-owned communities with

1,101

apartment homes, none of which have been completed, and

four

unconsolidated joint venture communities with 1,069 apartment homes, 99 of which have been completed. In addition, the Company was redeveloping


apartment homes,


of which have been completed, at

three

wholly-owned communities with 888 apartment homes.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty. Estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, to the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Cost Capitalization

In conformity with GAAP, we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.


In addition to construction costs, we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. As each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Company ceases capitalization on the related portion. The costs capitalized are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as

Total Real Estate Owned, Net of Accumulated Depreciation.

Amounts capitalized during the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


were $24.4 million, $22.4 million, and $29.2 million, respectively.

Investment in Unconsolidated Entities

We may enter into various joint venture agreements and/or partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. We determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement, applying the applicable accounting guidance. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Throughout our financial statements, and in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100% ownership interest.

We continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. The amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. If we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. The aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property. Should the actual results differ from management’s judgment, the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs (defined as Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy) related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

Real Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components, such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases, based on the fair value of each component. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including independent appraisals, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As such, the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease-up period. We determine the fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In addition, we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up period, and the carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. The fair value of in-place leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period.


REIT Status

We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a REIT. A REIT is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the Code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that a REIT must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gain) to our stockholders. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four years. Based on the net earnings reported for the year ended

December 31, 2016

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, we would have incurred federal and state GAAP income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a REIT.

Summary of Real Estate Portfolio by Geographic Market

The following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

(a)

Monthly Income per Occupied Home represents total monthly revenues divided by the average physical number of occupied apartment homes in our Same-Store portfolio.


(b)

As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company was developing

two

wholly-owned communities with

1,101

apartment homes,

none

of which have been completed.

(c)

The Company had one parcel of land located in Richmond, VA that met the criteria to be classified as held for disposition at

December 31, 2016

.

We report in two segments:

Same-Store Communities

and

Non-Mature Communities/Other

.

Our

Same-Store Communities

segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2015

and held as of

December 31, 2016

. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.

Our

Non-Mature Communities/Other

segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in

Same-Store Communities,

including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows, sales of properties, borrowings under our credit agreements, and/or the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements. We routinely use our unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. During the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, the repayment of financing on development activities, and potential property acquisitions, through secured and unsecured borrowings, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and/or the disposition of properties. We believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the Company in accordance with REIT requirements. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations, borrowings under credit agreements, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and/or dispositions of properties.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or “SEC,” which provides for the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants, subscription rights, purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets. Access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance.

On August 23, 2016, the Company issued

$300 million

of

2.95%

senior unsecured medium-term notes due September 1, 2026. Interest is payable semi-annually beginning on March 1, 2017. The Company used the net proceeds to prepay secured debt due in May 2017, pay down a portion of the borrowings outstanding on its

$1.1 billion

unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.

On March 4, 2016, the Company sold 5,000,000 shares of its common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $173.7 million at a price per share of $34.73. Aggregate net proceeds from the sale, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering-related expenses, were approximately

$173.2 million

, which were used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

In April 2012, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement, which was amended in July 2014, under which the Company may offer and sell up to 20 million shares of its common stock, from time to time, to or through its sales agents. During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the Company did not sell any shares of common stock through this program. As of

December 31, 2016

, we had

13.1 million

shares of common stock available for future issuance under the April 2012 program.


Future Capital Needs

Future development and redevelopment expenditures may be funded through unsecured or secured credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities, sales of properties, joint ventures, and, to a lesser extent, from cash flows provided by property operations. Acquisition activity in strategic markets may be funded through joint ventures, by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties, through the issuance of equity or debt securities, the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured and/or unsecured debt.

During


, we have approximately

$51.0 million

of secured debt maturing, inclusive of principal amortization, and

no

unsecured debt maturing. We anticipate repaying the debt with cash flow from our operations, proceeds from debt or equity offerings, proceeds from the dispositions of properties, or from borrowings under our credit agreements.

in 2016. See Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, in the Notes to the UDR, Inc. Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for a complete description of the ASU and its impact.

Upon adopting the ASU, we elected to classify distributions received from equity method investees using the cumulative earnings approach. As a result, the following retrospective changes were made:

Operating Activities

For the

year ended

December 31, 2016

,

Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities

was

$536.9 million

compared to

$458.6 million

for


. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved net operating income, primarily driven by revenue growth at communities, and an increase in cash from return on investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities.

For the

year ended

December 31, 2015

,

Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities

was

$458.6 million

compared to

$397.3 million

for


. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved net operating income, primarily driven by revenue growth at communities, and an increase in cash from return on investment in unconsolidated joint ventures.

Investing Activities

For the

year ended

December 31, 2016

,

Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities

was

$(112.3) million

compared to

$(265.5) million

for


. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to decreased acquisitions of real estate, a decrease in cash used for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, an increase in distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures and decreased capital expenditures and major renovations, partially offset by increased spend on consolidated development projects and a decrease in proceeds received from the sale of real estate assets.

For the

year ended

December 31, 2015

,

Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities

was

$(265.5) million

compared to

$(298.6) million

for


. The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily related to decreased spend


on consolidated development projects, partially offset by increased acquisitions of real estate, increased capital expenditures and major renovations, decreased distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures and issuances of notes receivable.

Acquisitions

In November 2016, the Company acquired an operating community in Redmond, Washington with


apartment homes for approximately

$70.5 million

, which was funded with tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges.

In October 2016, the Company increased its ownership from

50%

to

100%

in

two

operating communities located in Bellevue, Washington with a total of


apartment homes for approximately

$70.3 million

in cash,

which was funded with tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges,

and the assumption of an incremental

$37.9 million

of secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of

3.67%

. As a result, the Company consolidated the operating communities. The Company had previously accounted for its

50%

ownership interest as an unconsolidated joint venture. We accounted for the consolidation as a business combination resulting in a gain on consolidation of approximately

$36.4 million

.

In August 2016, the Company increased its ownership interest from

5%

to

100%

in a parcel of land in Dublin, California for a purchase price of approximately

$8.5 million

. As a result, the Company consolidated the parcel of land. UDR had previously accounted for its

5%

interest in the parcel of land as an unconsolidated joint venture. We accounted for the consolidation as an asset acquisition resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increased our real estate owned by

$8.9 million

.

In June 2016, the Company increased its ownership interest from

50%

to

100%

in a parcel of land in Los Angeles, California for a purchase price of approximately

$20.1 million

. As a result, the Company consolidated the parcel of land. UDR had previously accounted for its

50%

interest in the parcel of land as an unconsolidated joint venture. We accounted for the consolidation as an asset acquisition resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increased our real estate owned by

$31.1 million

. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company entered into a triple-net operating ground lease for the parcel of land at market terms with a third-party developer. The lessee plans to construct a multi-family community on the parcel of land. The ground lease provides the ground lessee with options to buy the fee interest in the parcel of land. The lease term is


years plus

two


-year extension options, does not transfer ownership to the lessee, and does not include a bargain purchase option.

In October 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of six Washington, D.C. area properties from Home Properties, L.P., a New York limited partnership (“Home OP”), for

$900.6 million

, which was comprised of

$564.8 million

of DownREIT Units in the newly formed DownREIT Partnership issued at

$35

per unit (a total of

16.1 million

units), the assumption of

$89.3 million

of debt,

$221.0 million

of reverse Section 1031 exchanges, and

$25.5 million

of cash. In addition, the Company issued approximately

14.0 million

shares of its Series F Preferred Stock to former limited partners of Home OP, which had the right to subscribe for one share of Series F Preferred Stock for each DownREIT Unit issued in connection with the acquisitions.

Of the six properties acquired from Home OP, four were acquired through the DownREIT Partnership, one was acquired by the Company through a reverse Section 1031 exchange and one was acquired by the Operating Partnership through a reverse Section 1031 exchange.

In February 2015, the Company acquired an office building in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, for consideration of approximately

$24.0 million

, which was comprised of assumed debt. The Company’s corporate offices, as well as other leased office space, are located in the acquired office building. The building consists of approximately

120,000

square feet. All existing leases were assumed by the Company at the time of the acquisition.

In 2014, the Company acquired a fully-entitled land parcel for future development located in Huntington Beach, California for $77.8 million, two communities located in Seattle, Washington and Kirkland, Washington with a total of 358 apartment homes for $45.5 million and $75.2 million, respectively, and a land parcel for future development located in Boston, Massachusetts for $32.2 million. The four acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2014 were accomplished through tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges.

Dispositions

In November 2016, the Company sold

seven

operating communities with a total of

1,402

apartment homes in Baltimore, Maryland and an operating community with


apartment homes in Dallas, Texas for gross proceeds of

$284.6 million

, resulting in net proceeds of

$280.5 million

and a gain, net of tax, of

$200.5 million

. A portion of the proceeds was designated for tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges.


In May 2016, the Company sold a retail center in Bellevue, Washington for gross proceeds of

$45.4 million

, resulting in net proceeds of

$44.1 million

and a gain, net of tax, of

$7.3 million

. A portion of the proceeds was designated for tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges.

In March 2016, the Company sold its

95%

ownership interest in two parcels of land in Santa Monica, California for gross proceeds of

$24.0 million

, resulting in net proceeds of

$22.0 million

and a gain, net of tax, of

$3.1 million

.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold


communities with a total of

2,735

apartment homes for gross proceeds of

$408.7 million

, resulting in net proceeds of

$387.7 million

and a gain of

$251.7 million

. A portion of the sale proceeds was designated for tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges for a 2014 acquisition and the October 2015 acquisitions.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized gains on the sale of real estate, net of tax, of

$143.6 million

. The Company sold nine communities consisting of a total of 2,500 apartment homes, a parcel of land, and one operating property for gross proceeds of $328.4 million, resulting in net proceeds of $324.4 million and a gain, net of tax, of $138.6 million. The Company also sold a 49% interest in a recently completed development for gross proceeds of $54.2 million, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of $7.2 million, and 50% interest in a land parcel for gross proceeds of $8.3 million, resulting in a loss, net of tax, of $2.2 million. A portion of the sale proceeds was designated for tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges and was used to fund certain acquisitions of real estate.

We plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital to primary locations in markets we believe will provide the best investment returns.

Capital Expenditures

We capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.

For the

year ended

December 31, 2016

, total capital expenditures of

$112.9 million

or

$2,786

per stabilized home, which in aggregate include recurring capital expenditures and major renovations, were spent on all of our communities, excluding development and commercial properties, as compared to

$111.3 million

or

$2,818

per stabilized home for the prior year.

The

increase

in total capital expenditures was primarily due to:

•

an

increase

of

34.7%

or

$11.4 million

in revenue-enhancing improvements, such as kitchen and bath remodels and upgrades to common areas.

This increase was partially offset by:

•

a decrease in major renovations of

35.3%

or

$11.6 million

, primarily due to lower redevelopment spend.


The following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities, excluding real estate under developments and commercial properties, for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


(

dollars in thousands

):

(a)  Major renovations include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings.

(b)  Average number of homes is calculated based on the number of homes outstanding at the end of each month.

The above table reports amounts capitalized during the year. Actual capital spending is impacted by the net change in capital expenditure accruals.

We intend to continue to selectively add revenue-enhancing improvements, which we believe will provide a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital. Our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement.

Consolidated Real Estate Under Development and Redevelopment

At

December 31, 2016

, our development pipeline of

two

wholly-owned communities totaled

1,101

homes, none of which have been completed, with a budget of

$708.5 million

, in which we have a carrying value of

$342.3 million

. The communities are estimated to be completed during the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. During


, we incurred

$178.3 million

for development costs, an increase of

$75.1 million

from our


level of

$103.2 million

.

The following wholly-owned projects were under development as of

December 31, 2016

(dollars in thousands)

:

At

December 31, 2016

, the Company was redeveloping 425 apartment homes, 351 of which have been completed, at three wholly-owned communities.

During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, we incurred

$21.3 million

in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings, a

decrease

of

$11.6 million

from our


level of

$32.9 million

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Partnerships

The Company recognizes earnings or losses from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships consisting of our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the joint ventures and partnerships. In addition, we may earn fees for providing management services to the unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships.

The Company’s investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships, net, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For the year ended

December 31, 2016

:

•

our proportionate share of the net income/(loss) of the joint ventures and partnerships was

$52.2 million

;

•

our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by

$80.6 million

due to the acquisition of 100% interest in properties previously held as unconsolidated entities, partially offset by capital contributions; and

•

we received distributions of

$123.7 million

, of which

$57.6 million

were operating cash flows and

$66.1 million

were investing cash flows.

We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. The Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary decreases in the value of its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships during the

year ended

December 31, 2016

Credit Facilities

We had three secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of

$636.8 million

, all of which was outstanding as of

December 31, 2016

. The Fannie Mae credit facilities mature at various dates from

May 2017

through

July 2023

, and bear interest at floating and fixed rates. At December 31, 2016,

$355.8 million

of the outstanding balance was fixed and had a weighted average interest rate of

5.06%

and the remaining balance of

$280.9 million

had a weighted average variable rate of

2.13%

. The Company prepaid a portion of the secured credit facility due in

May 2017

with a portion of the proceeds from the notes offering in August 2016.

The Company has a

$1.1 billion

senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and a

$350.0 million

senior unsecured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”). The credit agreement for these facilities allows the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the total borrowings under the Term Loan Facility to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to

$2.0 billion

, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from any one or more lenders. The Revolving Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 31, 2020, with

two

six

-month extension options, subject to certain conditions. The Term Loan Facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 29, 2021.

Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the Revolving Credit Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of


basis points and a facility fee of


basis points, and the Term Loan Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of


basis points. Depending on the Company’s credit rating, the margin under the Revolving Credit Facility ranges from


to


basis points, the facility fee ranges from

12.5

to


basis points, and the margin under the Term Loan Facility ranges from


to


basis points.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had

no

outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving

$1.1 billion

of unused capacity (excluding

$2.9 million

of letters of credit at

December 31, 2016

), and

$350.0 million

of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility.

We have a working capital credit facility, which provides for a $75 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Working Capital Credit Facility”) with a scheduled maturity date of January 1, 2019. Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the Working Capital Credit Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 90 basis points. Depending on the Company’s credit rating, the margin ranges from 85 to 155 basis points.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had

$21.4 million

of outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Credit Facility, leaving

$53.7 million

of unused capacity.


In July 2016, we amended the working capital credit facility to increase the maximum borrowing capacity from

$30 million

to

$75 million

. The scheduled maturity date and interest rate were unchanged by the amendment.

The Fannie Mae credit facilities and the bank unsecured revolving credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. As of

December 31, 2016

, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities.

On January 23, 2017, we entered into an unsecured commercial paper note program. Under the terms of the program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of

$500 million

. The notes are sold under customary terms in the United States commercial paper note market and rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. The Company intends to use the commercial paper program as an alternative funding source for amounts that would have otherwise been outstanding on the revolving credit facility and intends to manage the use of the commercial paper program so that the maximum combined amount outstanding under the commercial paper program and the revolving credit facility will not exceed the maximum borrowings permitted under the credit facility of

$1.1 billion

. As of

February 17, 2017

, we had issued

$120.0 million

of commercial paper notes, for one month terms, at a weighted average annualized rate of

1.16%

.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced. We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets. Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. We had

$432.0

million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of

December 31, 2016

. If market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, our interest expense would increase by $6.5 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These analysis do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.

The Company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. See Note 14,

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

, in the Notes to the UDR Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional discussion of derivate instruments.

A presentation of cash flow metrics based on GAAP is as follows (

.

Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders


-vs-


Net income attributable to common stockholders was

$289.0 million

(

$1.08

per diluted share) for the year ended

December 31, 2016

as compared to net income of

$336.7 million

(

$1.29

per diluted share) for the prior year. The decrease in net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended

December 31, 2016

resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report:


•

gains, net of tax, of

$210.9 million

on the sale of eight operating communities with a total of 1,782 apartment homes, a retail center and the Company’s 95% interest in two land parcels during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to gains, net of tax, of

$251.7 million

on the sale of 12 operating communities with a total of 2,735 apartment homes during the year ended December 31, 2015;

•

an increase in depreciation expense of

$45.0 million

due to homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and communities acquired in 2016 and 2015, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets;

•

a decrease in joint venture management and other fees of

$11.3 million

primarily due to the promote and fee income of $10.0 million recognized in connection with the sale of the Texas Joint Venture in 2015; and

•

a decrease in income from unconsolidated entities of

$10.1 million

primarily due to the sale of three operating communities by the UDR/MetLife II joint venture, which resulted in gains of $47.7 million for the Company, and a casualty gain of $3.8 million, as a result of insurance proceeds related to a September 2015 event received during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the sale of the eight communities held by the Texas Joint Venture, which resulted in a gain of

$59.4 million

, during the year ended December 31, 2015.

This was partially offset by:

•

an increase in total property NOI of

$59.2 million

primarily due to higher revenue per occupied home, NOI from the homes placed in service related to development and redevelopment projects completed in 2016 and 2015 and communities acquired in 2016 and 2015, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities.


-vs-


Net income attributable to common stockholders was $336.7 million ($1.29 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net income of $150.6 million ($0.59 per diluted share) for the prior year. The increase in net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

gains, net of tax, of $251.7 million on the sale of 12 operating communities with a total of 2,735 apartment homes during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to gains, net of tax, of $143.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014;

•

income from unconsolidated entities of $62.3 million, which includes a gain of

$59.4 million

(including $24.2 million of previously deferred gains) in connection with the sale of the eight communities held by the Texas joint venture; and

•

an increase in total property NOI of

$57.5 million

primarily due to higher occupancy and higher revenue per occupied home, NOI from the homes placed in service related to development and redevelopment projects completed in 2015 and 2014 and communities acquired in 2015 and 2014, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities.

This was partially offset by:

•

a decrease in

Interest income and other income/(expense), net

of $10.3 million primarily due to a net gain of $8.4 million on the early settlement of a note receivable in July 2014.

Apartment Community Operations

Our net income results are primarily from NOI generated from the operation of our apartment communities. The Company defines NOI, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense which is calculated as 2.75% of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent.

Although the Company considers NOI a useful measure of operating performance, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. NOI excludes


several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of NOI to

Net income/(loss) attributable to UDR, Inc.

below.

The following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property NOI (which includes discontinued operations) for each of the periods presented

(dollars in thousands):

(a)

Same-Store consists of

apartment homes.

(b)

Same-Store consists of 33,063 apartment homes.

for the

year ended

as compared to


. The

increase

in property NOI was primarily attributable to a 5.7% or $38.8 million increase in property rental income, which was partially offset by a 3.7% or $7.4 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in property income was primarily driven by a 5.5% or $35.9 million increase in rental rates and a 6.5% or $3.6 million increase in reimbursement and fee income. Physical occupancy was unchanged at 96.7% and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 5.6% to $1,958.

The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 9.2% or $6.5 million increase in real estate taxes, which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations and lower appeal refunds.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income)

NOI for our

Same-Store Community

properties increased $29.5 million or 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in property NOI was attributable to a 5.6% or $35.1 million increase in property rental income, which was partially offset by a 3.0% or $5.6 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in property income was primarily driven by a 5.1% or $30.4 million increase in rental rates and a 6.5% or $2.9 million increase in reimbursement and fee income. Physical occupancy was unchanged at 96.7% and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 5.5% to $1,721.

The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 2.9% or $1.8 million increase in real estate taxes, a 4.9% or $1.5 million increase in utilities expense, and a 3.1% or $1.4 million increase in personnel costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses, the operating margin (property net operating income divided by property rental income) increased to 71.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 70.3% for 2014.

. NOI from

Non-Mature Communities/Other

increased by 24.1% or $28.1 million for the


year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in NOI of $26.8 million from developed and redeveloped communities completed in 2015 and 2014 and $14.9 million from acquired communities, which was partially offset by a decrease in NOI of $19.1 million from communities sold or held for disposition in 2015 and 2014.

Joint Venture Management and Other Fees

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, we recognized income from joint venture management and other fees of

$11.4 million

,

$22.7 million

, and

$13.0 million

, respectively. The decreased income in 2016 as compared to 2015 and increased income in 2015 as compared to 2014 was attributable to the promote and fee income of $10.0 million recognized in connection with the sale of the Texas Joint Venture in 2015.

Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization

For the

year ended

December 31, 2016

, real estate depreciation and amortization

increase

d

12.0%

or

$45.0 million

as compared to


. The

increase

was primarily due to

homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and communities acquired in 2016 and 2015, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets.

For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, real estate depreciation and amortization increased 4.6% or $16.4 million as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to

homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and communities acquired in 2015 and 2014, partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets.

General and Administrative

For the

year ended

December 31, 2016

, general and administrative expense

decrease

d

16.6%

or

$9.9 million

from


. The decrease

was primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense and stock-based compensation expense for awards under the long-term incentive plan of $6.2 million, primarily due to the departure of our prior Chief Financial Officer in 2016 and outperformance in 2015, a decrease in long-term incentive plan transition costs of $2.6 million and a decrease in acquisition costs of $1.9 million, which was partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits.

For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, general and administrative expense increased 24.9% or $11.9 million from 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in bonus expense, a $4.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense for awards under the long-term incentive plan, of which $3.5 million was due to the transition from a one-year to a three-year performance period, a $1.8 million increase in acquisition-related costs, and an increase in salaries and benefits.

Income/(Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, we recognized income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities of

$52.2 million

,

$62.3 million

, and

$(7.0) million

, respectively. The decrease in income in 2016 as compared to 2015 of

$10.1 million

was primarily due to the sale of three operating communities by the UDR/MetLife II joint venture, which resulted in gains of $47.7 million for the Company, and a casualty gain of $3.8 million as a result of insurance proceeds related to a September 2015 event received during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the sale of the eight communities held by the Texas Joint Venture, which resulted in a gain of

$59.4 million

, during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in income in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the sale of the eight communities held by the Texas Joint Venture.

Interest Expense

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, we recognized interest expense of

$123.0 million

,

$121.9 million

and

$130.5 million

, respectively. The decrease in 2015 as compared to 2014 of 6.6% or $8.6 million was primarily due to the repayment of the $325.2 million medium term notes in January 2015 and the replacement of debt at lower rates.

Interest Income and Other Income/(Expense), Net

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


,

Interest income and other income/(expense), net

was

$1.9 million

,

$1.6 million

and

$11.9 million

, respectively. The decrease in 2015 as compared to 2014 of

$10.3 million

was primarily attributable to the net gain of $8.4 million realized on the repayment of a note receivable in 2014.


Tax Benefit/(Provision), Net

Income taxes for our TRS are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date.

The Company recognized a

Tax benefit/(provision), net

of

$3.8 million

,

$3.9 million

and

$15.1 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.

The decrease for 2016 as compared to


was primarily attributable to a one-time tax benefit of

$2.4 million

related to the conversion of certain taxable REIT subsidiary entities into REITs in 2016, offset by an increase in NOI of properties in the TRS.

The decrease for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to a one-time tax benefit of $5.8 million related to the conversion of certain taxable REIT subsidiary entities into REITs in 2014 and the resulting zero effective tax rate being applied to its 2015 income.

Gain/(Loss) on Sale of Real Estate Owned, Net of Tax

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company sold eight operating communities with a total of 1,782 apartment homes, a retail center, and its 95% interest in two land parcels, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of $210.9 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold 12 operating communities with a total of 2,735 apartment homes, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of $251.7 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized gains on the sale of real estate, net of tax, of $143.6 million. The Company sold nine operating communities consisting of a total of 2,500 apartment homes, a parcel of land, and one operating property for a gain, net of tax, of $138.6 million. The Company also sold a 49% interest in a recently completed development, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of $7.2 million, and our 50% interest in a land parcel, resulting in a loss, net of tax, of $2.2 million.

Noncontrolling Interest

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, we recognized net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership of

$27.3 million

,

$16.8 million

, and

$5.5 million

, respectively. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to the number of partnership units held by third-party noncontrolling interest holders as a result of the formation of the DownREIT Partnership in October 2015. The increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of partnership units held by third-party noncontrolling interest holders as a result of the formation of the DownREIT Partnership as well as increased net income of the Operating Partnership.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, the majority of our apartment leases have terms of 12 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material.


Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2016

(dollars in thousands):

(a)

Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments are based on each debt instrument’s respective year-end interest rate at

December 31, 2016

.

(b)

Any unfunded costs at

December 31, 2016

are shown in the year of estimated completion.

(c)

Represents UDR’s proportionate share of expected remaining costs to complete the developments.

(d)

For purposes of our ground lease contracts, the Company uses the minimum lease payment, if stated in the agreement. For ground lease agreements where there is a reset provision based on the communities appraised value or consumer price index but does not included a specified minimum lease payment, the Company uses the current rent over the remainder of the lease term.

During


, we incurred gross interest costs of $139.5 million, of which $16.5 million was capitalized.

Funds from Operations, Funds from Operations as Adjusted, and Adjusted Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations

Funds from operations (“FFO”) is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests, unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s (“NAREIT”) definition issued in April 2002. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of a REIT’s operating performance. In the computation of FFO, diluted, if OP Units, DownREIT Units, unvested restricted stock, stock options, and the shares of Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive, they are included in the diluted share count.

Activities of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”)

include development and land entitlement. From time to time, we develop and subsequently sell a TRS property which results in a short-term use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional long-term investment in real estate for REITs. We believe that the inclusion of these TRS gains in FFO is consistent with the standards established by NAREIT as the short-term investment is incidental to our main business. TRS gains on sales, net of taxes, are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation.


We consider FFO a useful metric for investors as we use FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance, and believe that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs.

Funds from Operations as Adjusted

FFO as Adjusted is defined as FFO excluding the impact of acquisition-related costs and other non-comparable items including, but not limited to, prepayment costs/benefits associated with early debt retirement, gains on sales of marketable securities and TRS property, deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases, casualty-related expenses and recoveries, severance costs and legal costs. Management believes that FFO as Adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other REITs.

FFO as Adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. We believe that

Net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders

is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO as Adjusted. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures and, accordingly, our FFO as Adjusted may not always be comparable to FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures calculated by other REITs. FFO as Adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity.

Adjusted Funds from Operations

Adjusted FFO (“AFFO”) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management uses as a supplemental measure of our performance. AFFO is defined as FFO as Adjusted less recurring capital expenditures on consolidated communities that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities. Therefore, management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company’s operational performance than FFO or FFO as Adjusted.

AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. We believe that

Net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders

is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not always be comparable to AFFO calculated by other REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.:

Business Overview

United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or “UDR, L.P.”) is a Delaware limited partnership formed in February 2004 and organized pursuant to the provisions of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. The Operating Partnership is the successor-in-interest to United Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership formed under the laws of Virginia, which commenced operations on November 4, 1995. Our sole general partner is UDR, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“UDR” or the “General Partner”), which conducts a substantial amount of its business and holds a substantial amount of its assets through the Operating Partnership. At

December 31, 2016

, the Operating Partnership’s real estate portfolio included


communities located in

eight

states and the District of Columbia with a total of

16,698

apartment homes.

As of

December 31, 2016

, UDR owned

110,883

units of our general limited partnership interests and

174,119,201

units of our limited partnership interests (the “OP Units”), or approximately

95.1%

of our outstanding OP Units. By virtue of its ownership of our OP Units and being our sole general partner, UDR has the ability to control all of the day-to-day operations of the Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this section of this Report to the Operating Partnership or “we,” “us” or “our” refer to UDR, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our General Partner together with its consolidated subsidiaries (including us) and the General Partner’s consolidated joint ventures as “UDR” or the “General Partner.”

UDR is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, and manages apartment communities. The General Partner was formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation and changed its state of incorporation from Virginia to Maryland in September 2003. At

December 31, 2016

, the General Partner’s consolidated real estate portfolio included


communities located in


states and the District of Columbia with a total of

39,454

apartment homes. In addition, the General Partner had an ownership interest in


communities with

6,849

completed apartment homes through unconsolidated operating communities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty. Estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

, to the Notes to the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.


Cost Capitalization

In conformity with GAAP, we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. Expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred.

In addition to construction costs, we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. As each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Operating Partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion. The costs capitalized are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as

Total real estate owned, net of accumulated depreciation

.

Amounts capitalized during the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, were $0.8 million, $0.9 million, and $4.9 million, respectively.

Investment in Unconsolidated Entities

We may enter into various joint venture agreements and/or partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. We determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement, applying the applicable accounting guidance. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Throughout our financial statements, and in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100% ownership interest.

We continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. The amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. If we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. The aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property. Should the actual results differ from management’s judgment, the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

Real Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components, such as land, buildings, and intangibles related to in-place leases, based on the fair value of each component. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including independent appraisals, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As such, the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease-up period. We determine the fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition. In addition, we consider the cost of


acquiring similar leases, the foregone rents associated with the lease-up period, and the carrying costs associated with the lease-up period. The fair value of in-place leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period.

Summary of Real Estate Portfolio by Geographic Market

The following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

(a)

Monthly Income per Occupied Home represents total monthly revenues divided by the product of occupancy and the number of mature apartment homes.

We report in two segments:

Same-Store Communities

and

Non-Mature Communities/Other

.

Our

Same-Store Communities

segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2015

and held as of

December 31, 2016

. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not held for disposition at year end. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months.

Our

Non-Mature Communities/Other

segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in

Same-Store Communities,

including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows, the sale of properties, and the issuance of debt. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. The Operating Partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the General Partner’s credit agreements. The General Partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longer-term financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities. During the past several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the General Partner’s credit agreements. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties. We believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions. Likewise, the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations, and borrowings allocated to us under the General Partner’s credit agreements.

Future Capital Needs

Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt, sales of properties, borrowings allocated to us under our General Partner’s credit agreements, and to a lesser extent, from cash flows provided by operating activities.

As of

December 31, 2016

Acquisitions

The Operating Partnership did not have any acquisitions during the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

In October 2015, the Operating Partnership acquired

one

community in Alexandria, Virginia with


apartment homes for a purchase price of

$142.0 million

.


Dispositions

During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the Operating Partnership sold

two

operating communities in the Baltimore, Maryland market with a total of


apartment homes for gross proceeds of

$45.3 million

, resulting in net proceeds of

$44.6 million

and a gain, net of tax, of

$33.2 million

.

In connection with the formation of the DownREIT Partnership in October 2015, the Operating Partnership contributed seven operating communities to the DownREIT Partnership. The Operating Partnership recorded its contribution to the DownREIT Partnership at book value and consequently deferred a gain of $296.4 million. As a result of the contribution, the Operating Partnership gave up its controlling interest and deconsolidated the seven operating communities.  The Operating Partnership accounts for its investment in the DownREIT Partnership under the equity method of accounting.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership sold five communities with a total of 1,149 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $250.9 million, resulting in net proceeds of $232.4 million and a gain, net of tax, of $133.5 million. A portion of the sale proceeds was designated for tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges for one of the October 2015 acquisitions from Home OP. Additionally, the Operating Partnership recognized a gain of $24.6 million, which was previously deferred, in connection with the sale of the communities held by the Texas joint venture.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Operating Partnership sold one community and an adjacent parcel of land in San Diego, California for gross proceeds of $48.7 million, resulting in a $24.4 million gain and net proceeds of $47.9 million. The Operating Partnership also recorded gains of $39.2 million in connection with UDR’s sale of two communities in Tampa, Florida and Los Angeles, California, which were previously deferred. The total gains of $63.6 million were included in

Gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned

,

Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities

was

$(221.5) million

compared to

$(247.7) million

for


. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in advances to the General Partner and a decrease in payoffs of secured debt, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of secured debt.

For the year ended

,

Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities

was

$(247.7) million

compared to

Credit Facilities

As of

December 31, 2016

, an aggregate commitment of

$408.5 million

of the General Partner's secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae was allocated to the Operating Partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt. The entire commitment was outstanding at

December 31, 2016

. The portions of the Fannie Mae credit facilities allocated to the Operating Partnership mature at various dates from

December 2018

through

July 2023

and bear interest at floating and fixed rates. At

December 31, 2016

,

$244.9 million

of the outstanding balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of

5.05%

and the remaining balance of

$163.6 million

on these facilities had a weighted average variable interest rate of

and


, the outstanding balance under the unsecured revolving credit facility was

$0.0

and

$150.0 million

, respectively.

The credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations.


Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced. We do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets. Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. We had

$190.6 million

in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of

December 31, 2016

. If market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, our interest expense would increase by $1.9 million based on the balance at

December 31, 2016

.

These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost. These analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.

The General Partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments allocated to the Operating Partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. See Note 8,

Derivatives and Hedging Activity

, in the Notes to the Operating Partnership’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional discussion of derivative instruments.

Results of Operations

The following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


.

Net Income(Loss) Attributable to OP Unitholders


-vs-


Net income/(loss) attributable to OP unitholders

was

$77.8 million

(

$0.42

per diluted OP Unit) for the

year ended

December 31, 2016

as compared to

$213.3 million

(

$1.16

per diluted OP Unit) for the prior year. The decrease in net income attributable to OP unitholders resulted primarily from the following items, which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

during the year ended the

December 31, 2016

, the Operating Partnership sold

two

operating communities in Baltimore, Maryland with a total of


apartment homes, resulting in a gain of

$33.2 million

, as compared to a gain on the sale of real estate owned of

$158.1 million

during the year ended December 31, 2015;

•

losses from unconsolidated entities of

$37.4 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, as compared to

$4.7 million

for the prior year, as a result of the formation of the DownREIT Partnership in the fourth quarter of 2015; and

•

a decrease in total property NOI of

$20.5 million

primarily due to fewer consolidated apartment homes as a result of the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership during 2015.

This was partially offset by:

•

a decrease in real estate depreciation and amortization expense of

$22.7 million

primarily due to the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership in the fourth quarter of 2015;


•

a decrease in interest expense of

$10.3 million

primarily due to the deconsolidation of debt balances related to communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership; and

•

a decrease in general and administrative expense of

$8.2 million

due to lower expense allocations by the General Partner, primarily due to a decrease in its bonus expense and stock-based compensation expense for awards under its long-term incentive plan, primarily due to the departure of its prior Chief Financial Officer in 2016, and outperformance in 2015.


-vs-


Net income/(loss) attributable to OP unitholders

was $213.3 million ($1.16 per diluted OP Unit) for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $96.2 million ($0.53 per diluted OP Unit) for the the prior year. The increase in net income attributable to OP unitholders resulted primarily from the following items, which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

•

the Operating Partnership sold five communities with a total of 1,149 apartment homes, resulting in a gain of $133.5 million. Additionally, the Operating Partnership recognized a gain of $24.6 million, which was previously deferred, in connection with the sale of the communities held by the Texas joint venture;

•

in connection with the formation of the DownREIT Partnership, the Operating Partnership contributed seven operating communities to the DownREIT Partnership. The Operating Partnership recorded its contribution to the DownREIT Partnership at book value and consequently deferred a gain of $296.4 million. As a result of the contribution, the Operating Partnership gave up its controlling interest and deconsolidated the seven operating communities.  The Operating Partnership accounts for its investment in the DownREIT Partnership under the equity method of accounting; and

•

an increase in total property NOI of

$17.3 million

primarily due to higher occupancy and higher revenue per occupied home and NOI from the homes placed in service related to development and redevelopment projects completed in 2015 and 2014.

This was partially offset by:

•

a $4.7 million loss from unconsolidated entities related to the DownREIT Partnership that was formed in 2015.

Apartment Community Operations

Our net income results primarily from NOI generated from the operation of our apartment communities. The Operating Partnership defines NOI, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI are property management costs, which are the Operating Partnership’s allocable share of costs incurred by the General Partner for shared services of corporate level property management employees and related support functions and costs.

Although the Company considers NOI a useful measure of a operating performance, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. NOI excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of NOI to

Net income/(loss) attributable to OP unitholders

For the year ended December 31, 2015, real estate depreciation and amortization decreased by 5.2% or $9.4 million as compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to sold communities and fully depreciated assets partially offset by homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities.

, general and administrative expense

decrease

d by

30.4%

The decrease was due to lower general and administrative expense allocations by the General Partner, primarily due to a decrease in its bonus expense and stock-based compensation expense for awards under its long-term incentive plan, primarily due to the departure of its prior Chief Financial Officer in 2016, and outperformance in 2015, as well as lower allocations due to the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the DownREIT Partnership in October 2015.

Interest Expense

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, interest expense

decrease

d by

25.4%

or

Gain/(Loss) on the Sale of Real Estate Owned

During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the Operating Partnership sold

two

operating communities in Baltimore, Maryland with a total of


apartment homes, resulting in a gain of

$33.2 million

.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership sold five communities with a total of 1,149 apartment homes, resulting in a gain of $133.5 million. A portion of the sale proceeds was designated for a Section 1031 exchange for one of the October 2015 acquisitions from Home OP. Additionally, the Operating Partnership recognized a gain of $24.6 million, which was previously deferred, in connection with the sale of the communities held by the Texas joint venture.

In connection with the formation of the DownREIT Partnership in October 2015, the Operating Partnership contributed seven operating communities to the DownREIT Partnership. The Operating Partnership recorded its contribution to the DownREIT Partnership at book value and consequently deferred a gain of $296.4 million. As a result of the contribution, the Operating Partnership gave up its controlling interest and deconsolidated the seven operating communities. The Operating Partnership accounts for its investment in the DownREIT Partnership under the equity method of accounting.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Operating Partnership sold one community and an adjacent parcel of land in San Diego, California, resulting in a $24.4 million gain. The Operating Partnership also recorded gains of $39.2 million in connection with UDR’s sale of two communities in Tampa, Florida and Los Angeles, California, which were previously deferred.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. While the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, the majority of our apartment leases have terms of 12 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. Although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material.


Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of

(

(a)

Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments are based on each debt instrument’s respective year-end interest rate at

(b)

For purposes of our ground lease contracts, the Operating Partnership uses the minimum lease payment, if stated in the agreement. For ground lease agreements where there is a reset provision based on the communities appraised value or consumer price index but does not include a specified minimum lease payment, the Operating Partnership uses the current rent over the remainder of the lease term.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of UDR, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UDR, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).  These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of UDR, Inc. at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its reporting of discontinued operations as a result of the adoption of the amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification resulting from Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, “Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360), Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity”. Also, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its presentation of distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the adoption of the amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification resulting from Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), UDR, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of UDR, Inc.

We have audited UDR, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). UDR, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, UDR, Inc.

maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of UDR, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 and our report dated February 21, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

DECEMBER 31, 2016

1. CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Organization and Formation

UDR, Inc. (“UDR,” the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages apartment communities generally in high barrier-to-entry markets located in the United States. The high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive single-family home prices and significant employment growth potential. At

December 31, 2016

, our consolidated apartment portfolio consisted of


consolidated communities located in


markets consisting of

39,454

apartment homes. In addition, the Company has an ownership interest in

6,849

apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of UDR include its wholly-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries (see the “Consolidated Joint Ventures” section of Note 6,

Joint Ventures and Partnerships

, for further discussion). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UDR and its subsidiaries, including United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or the “OP”) and UDR Lighthouse DownREIT L.P. (the “DownREIT Partnership”). As of

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-01,

Business Combinations (Topic 805), Clarifying the Definition of a Business.

The ASU changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether a set of transferred assets is a business. As a result, the accounting for acquisitions of real estate could be impacted. The updated standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018; early adoption is permitted. The ASU will be applied prospectively to any transactions occurring within the period of adoption. The Company expects that the updated standard will result in fewer acquisitions of real estate meeting the definition of a business and fewer acquisition-related costs being expensed in the period incurred.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Restricted Cash

. The ASU addresses the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The updated standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented; early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the updated standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

. The ASU addresses specific cash flow items with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice, including the treatment of distributions received from equity method investees.

The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-15 in 2016 and elected to classify distributions received from equity method investees using the cumulative earnings approach. As a result, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the following amounts classified under the adopted ASU as returns on investment in unconsolidated joint ventures were reclassified on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow

(in thousands)

:

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

. The standard requires entities to estimate a lifetime expected credit loss for most financial assets, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, and to present the net amount of the financial instrument expected to be collected. The updated standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2020; early adoption is permitted on January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

. The ASU aims to simplify the accounting for share-based payments by amending the accounting for forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, classification in the statements of cash flow and income taxes. The updated standard was effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, at which time the Company prospectively began accounting for forfeitures as incurred and began applying the updated rules for statutory withholdings. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases

. The standard amends the existing lease accounting guidance and requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (except for short-term leases that have a duration of one year or less) on their balance sheets. Lessees will continue to recognize lease expense in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, accounting for leases under the new guidance is substantially the same as in prior periods, but eliminates current real estate-specific provisions and changes the treatment of initial direct costs. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparable period presented, with an option to elect certain transition relief. Full retrospective application is prohibited. The standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. While the Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect to recognize right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets related to ground leases on any communities where we are the lessee.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

, which makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model of consolidation. Under ASU 2015-02, companies will need to re-evaluate whether an entity meets the criteria to be considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”) or whether the consolidation of an entity should be assessed under the voting model. The new standard specifically eliminates the presumption in the current voting model that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless that presumption can be overcome. The new standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2016. The adoption of the new standard did not result in the consolidation of entities not previously consolidated or the deconsolidation of any entities previously consolidated. Upon adopting the new standard, the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership became VIEs as the limited partners of these entities lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. The Company is the primary beneficiary of, and continues to consolidate, the entities determined to be VIEs.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. The standard provides companies with a single model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The standard specifically excludes lease contracts. The ASU allows for the use of either the full or modified retrospective

transition method and will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, at which time the Company expects to adopt the updated standard using the modified retrospective approach. However, as the majority of the Company’s revenue is from rental income related to leases, the Company does not expect the ASU to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Real Estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and other costs incurred during their development, acquisition and redevelopment.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition and/or improvement of real estate assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the expenditures qualify as a betterment or the life of the related asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life expectancy.

UDR purchases real estate investment properties and records the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair value. The primary, although not only, identifiable intangible asset associated with our portfolio is the value of existing lease agreements. When recording the acquisition of a community, we first assign fair value to the estimated intangible value of the existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the land, building and fixtures assuming the community is vacant. The Company estimates the intangible value of the lease agreements by determining the lost revenue associated with a hypothetical lease-up. Depreciation on the building is based on the expected useful life of the asset and the in-place leases are amortized over their remaining average contractual life. Property acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

Quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant, UDR will assess our real estate properties for indicators of impairment. In determining whether the Company has indicators of impairment in our real estate assets, we assess whether the long-lived asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s undiscounted future cash flows, which is representative of projected net operating income (“NOI”) plus the residual value of the community. Our future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. If such indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties classified as real estate held for disposition generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months. Real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less the cost to sell, determined on an asset-by-asset basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for disposition properties are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to held for disposition properties are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which are

35 to 55 years

for buildings,

10 to 35 years

for major improvements, and

3 to 10 years

for furniture, fixtures, equipment, and other assets.

Predevelopment, development, and redevelopment projects and related costs are capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as

Total real estate owned, net of accumulated depreciation

. The Company capitalizes costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. These costs, excluding the direct costs of development and redevelopment and capitalized interest, for the years ended

$16.1 million

, and

$20.2 million

, respectively. As each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Company ceases capitalization on the related portion and depreciation commences over the estimated useful life.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short-term, highly liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and security deposits.

Revenue and Real Estate Sales Gain Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents and tenants in accordance with GAAP. Rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis and recognized when earned. The Company recognizes interest income, management and other fees and incentives when earned, and the amounts are fixed and determinable.

For sale transactions meeting the requirements for full accrual profit recognition, we remove the related assets and liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes. For sale transactions that do not meet the full accrual sale criteria due to our continuing involvement, we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement and account for the transaction under an alternate method of accounting. Unless certain limited criteria are met, non-monetary transactions, including property exchanges, are accounted for at fair value.

Sales to entities in which we retain or otherwise own an interest are accounted for as partial sales. If all other requirements for recognizing profit under the full accrual method have been satisfied and no other forms of continuing involvement are present, we recognize profit proportionate to the outside interest in the buyer and defer the gain on the interest we retain. The Company recognizes any deferred gain when the property is sold to a third party. In transactions accounted for by us as partial sales, we determine if the buyer of the majority equity interest in the venture was provided a preference as to cash flows in either an operating or a capital waterfall. If a cash flow preference has been provided, we recognize profit only to the extent that proceeds from the sale of the majority equity interest exceed costs related to the entire property.

Investment in Joint Ventures and Partnerships

We use the equity method to account for investments in joint ventures and partnerships that qualify as variable interest entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and other entities that we do not control or where we do not own a majority of the economic interest but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Throughout these financial statements we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100% ownership interest. The Company also uses the equity method when we function as the managing partner and our venture partner has substantive participating rights or where we can be replaced by our venture partner as managing partner without cause. For a joint venture or partnership accounted for under the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses is reflected as income/loss when earned/incurred and distributions are credited against our investment in the joint venture or partnership as received.

In determining whether a joint venture or partnership is a variable interest entity, the Company considers: the form of our ownership interest and legal structure; the size of our investment; the financing structure of the entity, including necessity of subordinated debt; estimates of future cash flows; ours and our partner’s ability to participate in the decision making related to acquisitions, disposition, budgeting and financing of the entity; obligation to absorb losses and preferential returns; nature of our partner’s primary operations; and the degree, if any, of disproportionality between the economic and voting interests of the entity. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company did not determine any of our joint ventures or partnerships to be variable interest entities.

We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for events or changes in circumstances that indicate there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, the fair value of the property of the joint venture, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. The amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. If we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. The aforementioned factors are taken into consideration as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our equity method investments. Should the actual results differ from management’s judgment, the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability and measured quarterly at their fair value. The changes in fair value for cash flow hedges that are deemed effective are reflected in other comprehensive income/(loss) and for non-designated derivative financial instruments in earnings. The ineffective component of cash flow hedges, if any, is recorded in earnings.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership

Interests in the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership held by limited partners are represented by OP Units and DownREIT Units, respectively. The income is allocated to holders of OP Units/DownREIT Units based upon net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of OP Units/DownREIT Units outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units/DownREIT Units outstanding during the period. Capital contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to noncontrolling interests in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreements of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership.

Limited partners of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership have the right to require such partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units/DownREIT Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership, as applicable), provided that such OP Units/DownREIT Units have been outstanding for at least one year. UDR, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units/DownREIT Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of Common Stock of the Company for each OP Unit/DownREIT Unit), as defined in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership, as applicable. Accordingly, the Company records the OP Units outside of permanent equity and reports the OP Units at their redemption value using the Company’s stock price at each balance sheet date.

Income Taxes

Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations for the operating properties, no provision for federal income taxes has been provided for at UDR. Historically, the Company has generally incurred only state and local excise and franchise taxes. UDR has elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”).

Income taxes for our TRS are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date. The Company’s deferred tax assets are generally the result of differing depreciable lives on capitalized assets and timing of expense recognition for certain accrued liabilities. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, UDR’s net deferred tax asset was

$0.6 million

and

$11.8 million

, respectively.

GAAP defines a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition.

The Company recognizes its tax positions and evaluates them using a two-step process. First, UDR determines whether a tax position is more likely tha

Principles of Consolidation

The Company accounts for subsidiary partnerships, joint ventures and other similar entities in which it holds an ownership interest in accordance with the amended consolidation guidance. The Company first evaluates whether each entity is a VIE. Under the VIE model, the Company consolidates an entity when it has control to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Under the voting

F -  16

UDR, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2016

model, the Company consolidates an entity when it controls the entity through ownership of a majority voting interest.

Discontinued Operations

In accordance with GAAP, a discontinued operation represents (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale in a single transaction and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s financial results, or (2) an acquired business that is classified as held for sale on the date of acquisition. A strategic shift could include a disposal of (1) a separate major line of business, (2) a separate major geographic area of operations, (3) a major equity method investment, or (4) other major parts of an entity.

We record sales of real estate that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation in

Gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned, net of tax

Stock-Based Employee Compensation Plans

The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the award’s fair value on the grant date and recognizes the cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value for stock options issued by the Company is calculated utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton formula. For performance based awards, the Company remeasures the fair value each balance sheet date with adjustments made on a cumulative basis until the award is settled and the final compensation is known. The fair value for market based awards issued by the Company is calculated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation. For further discussion, see Note 10,

Employee Benefit Plans.

Cost of Raising Capital

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of equity securities are deducted from stockholders’ equity. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance or renewal of debt are recorded based on the terms of the debt issuance or renewal. Accordingly, if the terms of the renewed or modified debt instrument are deemed to be substantially different (i.e. a 10 percent or greater difference in the cash flows between instruments), all unamortized financing costs associated with the extinguished debt are charged to earnings in the current period and certain costs of new debt issuances are capitalized and amortized over the term of the debt. When the cash flows are not substantially different, the lender costs associated with the renewal or modification are capitalized and amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt instrument and other related costs are expensed. The balance of any unamortized financing costs associated with retired debt is expensed upon retirement. Deferred financing costs for new debt instruments include fees and costs incurred by the Company to obtain financing. Deferred financing costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over a period not to exceed the term of the related debt.

Comprehensive Income/(Loss)

Comprehensive income/(loss), which is defined as the change in equity during each period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources, including all changes in equity during a period except for those resulting from investments by or distributions to stockholders, is displayed in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income/(Loss).

Effective January 1, 2014, UDR prospectively adopted ASU No. 2014-08,

Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than in

Income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Prior to the prospective adoption of ASU 2014-08, FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 205-20 required, among other things, that the primary assets and liabilities and the results of operations of UDR’s real properties that have been sold or are held for disposition, be classified as discontinued operations and segregated in UDR’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Consequently, the primary assets and liabilities and the net operating results of those properties sold or classified as held for disposition prior to January 1, 2014 are accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented. This presentation does not have an impact on net income available to common stockholders; it only results in the reclassification of the operating results within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period ended December 31, 2014.

During 2014, the Company sold

one

operating property that was classified as held for disposition prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08 and, therefore, met the requirements to be reported as a discontinued operation. The sale of this property resulted in an immaterial gain, net of tax, of less than

Acquisitions

In November 2016, the Company acquired an operating community in Redmond, Washington with


apartment homes for approximately

$70.5 million

, which was funded with

tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Section 1031 exchanges”)

in cash, which was funded with

tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges and

the assumption of an incremental

$37.9 million

of secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of

3.67%

. As a result, the Company consolidated the operating communities. The Company had previously

accounted for its

50%

ownership interest as an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 6,

). We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination resulting in a gain on consolidation of approximately

$36.4 million

. As a result of the consolidation, the Company increased its real estate owned by

.

In June 2016, the Company increased its ownership interest from

50%

to

100%

in a parcel of land in Los Angeles, California for a purchase price of approximately

$20.1 million

. As a result, the Company consolidated the parcel of land. UDR had previously accounted for its

interest in the parcel of land as an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 6,

Joint Ventures and Partnerships

). We accounted for the consolidation as an asset acquisition resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increased our real estate owned by

$31.1 million

. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company entered into a triple-net operating ground lease for the parcel of land at market terms with a third-party developer. The lessee plans to construct a multi-family community on the parcel of land. The ground lease provides the ground lessee with options to buy the fee interest in the parcel of land. The lease term is


years plus

two


-year extension options, does not transfer ownership to the lessee, and does not include a bargain purchase option.

In October 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of

six

Washington, D.C. area properties from Home Properties, L.P., a New York limited partnership (“Home OP”), for a contractual purchase price of

$900.6 million

, which was comprised of

$564.8 million

of newly issued DownREIT Units in the newly formed DownREIT Partnership issued at

$35

per unit (a total of

16.1 million

units), the assumption of

$89.3 million

of debt,

$221.0 million

of reverse tax-deferred Section 1031 exchanges, and

$25.5 million

of cash. In addition, the Company issued approximately

14.0 million

shares of its Series F Preferred Stock to former limited partners of Home OP, which had the right to subscribe for one share of Series F Preferred Stock for each DownREIT Unit issued in connection with the acquisitions.

In February 2015, the Company acquired an office building in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, for consideration of approximately

$24.0 million

, which was comprised of assumed debt. The Company’s corporate offices, as well as other leased office space, are located in the acquired building. The building consists of approximately

120,000

square feet. All existing leases were assumed by the Company at the time of the acquisition.

On January 25, 2017, the Company exercised its fixed price option to purchase the joint venture partner’s ownership interest and therefore increased its ownership interest from

49%

to

100%

in an operating community located in Seattle, Washington with


apartment homes for a cash purchase price of approximately

$66.0 million

. As a result, as of January 25, 2017, the Company consolidated the operating community. As of December 31, 2106, the Company accounted for its

49%

interest as a preferred equity investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 6,

Joint Ventures and Partnerships

).

The Company incurred

$0.2 million

,

$2.1 million

and

$0.4 million

of acquisition-related costs during the years ended

5. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

As of January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02. See discussion in Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies

for further details. As a result of the adoption, the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership were determined to be VIEs. As the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary, we will continue to consolidate these entities.

The Company has determined that the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership are VIEs as the limited partners lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. The Company has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of, and therefore continues to consolidate, the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership based on its role as the manager of the communities and its direct ownership interests, including all general partner interests. The Company's role as community manager and its equity interests give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or the right to receive potentially significant benefits of the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership.

See the consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership presented within this Report and Note 4,

Unconsolidated Entities

, to the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements for the results of operations of the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership, respectively.

6. JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS

UDR has entered into joint ventures and partnerships with unrelated third parties to acquire real estate assets that are either consolidated and included in

Real estate owned

on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and are included in

Investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, net

, o

n the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company consolidates the entities that we control as well as any variable interest entity where we are the primary beneficiary. In addition, the Company consolidates any joint venture or partnership in which we are the general partner or managing partner and the third party does not have the ability to substantively participate in the decision-making process nor the ability to remove us as general partner or managing partner without cause.

UDR’s joint ventures and partnerships are funded with a combination of debt and equity. Our losses are limited to our investment and except as noted below, the Company does not guarantee any debt, capital payout or other obligations associated with our joint ventures and partnerships.

The Company recognizes earnings or losses from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships consisting of our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the joint ventures and partnerships. In addition, we may earn fees for providing management services to the unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships.

(c)

In September 2015, the 717 Olympic community, which is owned by the UDR/MetLife II joint venture, experienced extensive water damage due to a ruptured water pipe. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded casualty-related charges/(recoveries) of

$(3.8) million

and

$2.5 million

, respectively, its proportionate share of the total charges/(recoveries) recognized.

In September 2016, the UDR/MetLife II joint venture sold an operating community located in Dallas, Texas with


apartment homes for a sales price of approximately

$74.7 million

$11.3 million

for the Company.

In October 2016, the Company increased its ownership from

50%

to

100%

in

two

operating communities located in Bellevue, Washington with a total of


apartment homes for a cash purchase price of approximately

$70.3 million

in cash

and

the assumption of an incremental

$37.9 million

of secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of

3.67%

. As a result, the Company consolidated the operating communities and they are no longer accounted for as unconsolidated joint ventures (see Note 4,

Real Estate Owned

). The operating communities were previously held in the UDR/MetLife II joint venture.

(d)

In June 2016, the Company increased its ownership interest from

50%

to

100%

in a parcel of land in Los Angeles, California for a purchase price of approximately

$20.1 million

As of

December 31, 2016

, construction was completed on

four

of the

five

communities held by the West Coast Development Joint Venture and two of the five communities had achieved stabilization, which, for purposes of the joint venture, is defined as when a community reaches

80%

occupancy for


consecutive days. Upon stabilization, income and expense are shared based on each partner's ownership percentage and the Company no longer receives a

6.5%

preferred return on its investment in the stabilized community. The remaining three communities have not achieved stabilization and the Company continues to receive a

6.5%

preferred return on its investment in those communities.

The Company will serve as property manager and be paid a management fee during the lease-up phase and subsequent operation of each of the communities. The joint venture partner is the general partner of the joint venture and the developer of the communities.

The Company has a fixed price option to acquire the remaining interest in each community beginning

one

year after completion. If the options are exercised for all

five

communities, the Company’s total purchase price will be

$597.4 million

. In the event the Company does not exercise its options to purchase at least

two

communities, the joint venture partner will be entitled to earn a contingent disposition fee equal to

6.5%

return on its implied equity in the communities not acquired. The joint venture partner is providing certain guaranties and there are construction loans on all

five

communities. Once completed, the

five

communities will contain

1,533

homes.

The Company has concluded it does not control the joint venture and accounts for it under the equity method of accounting. The Company's recorded equity investment in the West Coast Development Joint Venture at

December 31, 2016

In October 2016, the Company assumed debt with a fair market value of

$80.0 million

, inclusive of a

$4.2 million

Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

UDR’s Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows common and preferred stockholders the opportunity to purchase, through the reinvestment of cash dividends, additional shares of UDR’s common stock. From inception through December 31, 2008, shareholders have elected to utilize the Stock Purchase Plan to reinvest their distribution for the equivalent of

9,957,233

shares of Company common stock. Shares in the amount of

10,963,730

were reserved for issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan as of

December 31, 2016

. During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, UDR acquired all shares issued through the open market.

10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

In May 2001, the stockholders of UDR approved the long term incentive plan (“LTIP”), which supersedes the 1985 Stock Option Plan. The LTIP authorizes the granting of awards which may take the form of options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards, and any other right or interest relating to common stock or cash incentive awards to Company directors, employees and outside trustees to promote the success of the Company by linking individual’s compensation via grants of share based payment.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the LTIP was amended to set forth the terms of new classes of partnership interests in the Operating Partnership designated as LTIP Units. LTIP Units are designed to qualify as “profits interests” in the Operating Partnership for federal income tax purposes, meaning that initially they are not economically equivalent in value to a share of our common stock, but over time can increase in value to one-for-one parity with common stock by operation of special tax rules applicable to profits interests. Until and unless such parity is reached, the value that an executive will realize for a given number of vested LTIP units is less than the value of an equal number of shares of our common stock.

As of December 31, 2016,

19,000,000

shares were reserved on an unadjusted basis for issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards under the LTIP. As of

December 31, 2016

, there were

9,192,402

common shares available for issuance under the LTIP.

The LTIP contains change of control provisions allowing for the immediate vesting of an award upon certain events such as a merger where UDR is not the surviving entity. Upon the death or disability of an award recipient all outstanding instruments will vest and all restrictions will lapse. The LTIP specifies that in the event of a capital transaction, which includes but is not limited to stock dividends, stock splits, extraordinary cash dividends and spin-offs, the number of shares available for grant in totality or to a single individual is to be adjusted proportionately. The LTIP specifies that when a capital transaction occurs that would dilute the holder of the stock award, prior grants are to be adjusted such that the recipient is no worse as a result of the capital transaction.

A summary of UDR’s stock option and restricted stock activities during the year ended

Restricted Stock Awards

Restricted stock awards are granted to Company employees, officers, and directors. The restricted stock awards are valued based upon the closing sales price of UDR common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recorded under the straight-line method over the vesting period, which is generally

three

to

four

years. Restricted stock awards earn dividends payable in cash. Some of the restricted stock grants are based on the Company’s performance and are subject to adjustment during the initial one year performance period. For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, we recognized

$3.4 million

,

$3.2 million

, and

$4.2 million

of compensation expense, net of capitalization, related to the amortization of restricted stock awards, respectively. The total remaining compensation cost on unvested restricted stock awards was

Long-Term Incentive Compensation

In January 2016, certain officers of the Company were awarded either a restricted stock grant or an LTIP Unit grant, or a combination of both, under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Program (“2016 LTI”). For both restricted stock grants and LTIP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2016

Unit grants, one-third of the 2016 LTI award is based upon FFO as Adjusted over a one-year period and will vest fifty percent on the one-year anniversary and fifty percent on the two-year anniversary of the end of the performance period. The remaining two-thirds of the 2016 LTI award is based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) as measured relative to comparable apartment REITs over a three-year period and will vest

100%

at the end of the three-year performance period. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon FFO as Adjusted was valued based upon the closing sales price of UDR common stock on the date of grant or

$36.97

per share. Because LTIP Units are granted at the maximum potential payout and there is uncertainty associated with an LTIP Unit reaching parity with the value of a share of UDR common stock, the portion of the LTIP Unit grant based upon FFO as Adjusted was valued at

$16.64

per unit on the grant date, inclusive of a

10%

discount. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon TSR was valued at

$41.22

per share on the grant date as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a volatility factor of

21.8%

. The portion of the LTIP Unit grant based upon TSR was valued at

$19.15

per unit on the grant date as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a volatility factor of

.

In January 2015, certain officers of the Company were awarded a restricted stock grant under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Program (“2015 LTI”). One-third of the 2015 LTI award is based upon FFO as Adjusted over a one-year period and will vest fifty percent on the one-year anniversary and fifty percent on the two-year anniversary of the end of the performance period. The remaining two-thirds of the 2015 LTI award is based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) as measured relative to comparable apartment REITs over a three-year period and will vest

100%

at the end of the three-year performance period. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon FFO as Adjusted was valued based upon the closing sales price of UDR common stock on the date of grant. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon TSR was valued at

$34.14

per share on the grant date as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a volatility factor of

16.5%

.

In December 2014, when the LTI program was changed from a one-year to a three-year performance period, a one-time transition (“Transition LTI”) award opportunity was approved commencing in 2015. One-third of the Transition LTI award is based upon FFO as Adjusted over a one-year period and will vest at the end of the performance period. The remaining two-thirds of the Transition LTI award is based on TSR as measured relative to comparable apartment REITs over a two-year period and will vest

100%

at the end of the two-year performance period. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon FFO as Adjusted was valued based upon the closing sales price of UDR common stock on the date of grant. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon TSR was valued at

$33.68

per share on the grant date as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a volatility factor of

16.6%

. The intent of the transition award is to ensure consistent reward opportunity during the phase-in period of the three-year awards under the 2015 LTI plan.

In February 2014, certain officers of the Company were awarded a restricted stock grant under the 2014 Long-Term Incentive Program (“2014 LTI”). Fifty percent of the 2014 LTI award is based upon FFO as Adjusted and fifty percent is based on TSR as measured relative to comparable apartment REITs. The actual amount that vests was determined in February 2015 based upon the actual achievement of the metrics. Each award vests pro rata over three years commencing with the establishment of the award and continuing for two years following determination of the amount of the award at the end of the annual performance period. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon FFO as Adjusted was valued based upon the closing sales price of UDR common stock on the date of grant. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon TSR was valued at

$21.15

per share on the grant date as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a volatility factor of

23.8%

. Compensation expense is recorded under the accelerated method over the vesting period for the 2014 LTI.

In February 2013, certain officers of the Company were awarded a restricted stock grant under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Program (“2013 LTI”). Fifty percent of the 2013 LTI award is based upon FFO and fifty percent is based on TSR as measured relative to comparable apartment REITs. The actual amount that vests was determined in February 2014 based upon the actual achievement of the metrics. Each award vests pro rata over three years commencing with the establishment of the award and continuing for two years following determination of the amount of the award at the end of the annual performance period. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon FFO was valued based upon the closing sales price of UDR common stock on the date of grant. The portion of the restricted stock grant based upon TSR was valued at

$21.97

per share on the grant date as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a volatility factor of

For income tax purposes, distributions paid to common stockholders may consist of ordinary income, qualified dividends, capital gains, unrecaptured section 1250 gains, return of capital, or a combination thereof. Distributions that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits constitute a return of capital rather than taxable income and reduce the stockholder’s basis in their common shares. To the extent that a distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder’s basis in the common shares, it generally will be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder’s common shares.

GAAP defines a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of income tax positions presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the tax position and all relevant facts, but without considering time values. GAAP also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition.

The Company evaluates our tax position using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than

not (greater than 50 percent probability)

to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company will then determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. When applicable, UDR recognizes interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in

12. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership

Interests in the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership held by limited partners are represented by OP Units and DownREIT Units, respectively. The income is allocated to holders of OP Units/DownREIT Units based upon net income attributable to common stockholders and the weighted average number of OP Units/DownREIT Units outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units/DownREIT Units outstanding during the period. Capital contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to noncontrolling interests in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreements of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership.

Limited partners of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership have the right to require such partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units/DownREIT Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership, as applicable), provided that such OP Units/DownREIT Units have been outstanding for at least one year, subject to certain exceptions. UDR, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units/DownREIT Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share

13. FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are described below:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments either recorded or disclosed on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2016

and


are summarized as follows

(d)

See Note 12,

Noncontrolling Interests.

There were no transfers into or out of each of the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value

The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate options are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities.

The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

UDR, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2016

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of

December 31, 2016

and


, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In conjunction with the FASB’s fair value measurement guidance, the Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership have a redemption feature and are marked to their redemption value. The redemption value is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the redemption date, and therefore, is calculated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the balance sheet date. Since the valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership are classified as Level 2.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

At

December 31, 2016

, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaids, real estate taxes payable, accrued interest payable, security deposits and prepaid rent, distributions payable and accounts payable approximated their carrying values because of the short term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair values of other financial instruments were determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize on the disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

We estimate the fair value of our notes receivable and debt instruments by discounting the remaining cash flows of the debt instrument at a discount rate equal to the replacement market credit spread plus the corresponding treasury yields. Factors considered in determining a replacement market credit spread include general market conditions, borrower specific credit spreads, time remaining to maturity, loan-to-value ratios and collateral quality, where applicable (Level 3).

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value. Our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based upon Level 3 inputs such as industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, net is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. Based on the significance of the unobservable inputs, we classify these fair value measurements within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company did not incur any other-than-temporary decrease in the value of its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures during the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


.

After determining an other-than-temporary decrease in the value of an equity method investment has occurred, we estimate the fair value of our investment by estimating the proceeds we would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation of the investment at the date of measurement. Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the investment giving consideration to the terms of the joint venture agreement and the estimated discounted future cash flows to be generated from the underlying joint venture assets. The inputs and assumptions utilized to estimate the future cash flows of the underlying assets are based upon the Company’s evaluation of the economy, market trends, operating results, and other factors, including judgments regarding costs to complete any construction activities, lease up and occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation rates, capitalization rates utilized to estimate the projected cash flows at the disposition, and discount rates.

14. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s investments and borrowings.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up front premium.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt and forecasted issuances of fixed-rate debt. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the Company recorded

no

ineffectiveness to earnings. During the year ended

December 31, 2015

, the Company recognized a loss of less than

$0.1 million

Interest expense

due to the de-designation of a cash flow hedge and recorded

no

other ineffectiveness to earnings. During the year ended December 31,


, the Company recorded a gain of less than

$0.1 million

of ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to a timing difference between the derivative and the hedged item.

Amounts reported in

Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net

will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

As of

December 31, 2016

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features

The Company has agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations; or (2) the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the Company’s default on the indebtedness.

Certain of the Company’s agreements with its derivative counterparties contain provisions where, if there is a change in the Company’s financial condition that materially changes the Company’s creditworthiness in an adverse manner, the

cash collateral was posted or required to be posted by the Company or by a counterparty.

The Company also has an agreement with a derivative counterparty that incorporates the loan and financial covenant provisions of the Company’s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with these covenant provisions would result in the Company being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement.

The Company has certain agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where, in the event of default by the Company or the counterparty, the right of setoff may be exercised. Any amount payable to one party by the other party may be reduced by its setoff against any amounts payable by the other party. Events that give rise to default by either party may include, but are not limited to, the failure to pay or deliver payment under the derivative agreement, the failure to comply with or perform under the derivative agreement, bankruptcy, a merger without assumption of the derivative agreement, or in a merger, a surviving entity's creditworthiness is materially weaker than the original party to the derivative agreement.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was

$3.8 million

Contingencies

Litigation and Legal Matters

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company cannot determine the ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and claims at this time. The Company believes that such liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

16. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

GAAP guidance requires that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker to decide how to allocate resources and for purposes of assessing such segments’ performance. UDR’s chief operating decision maker is comprised of several members of its executive management team who use several generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance of the business for our reportable operating segments.

UDR owns and operates multifamily apartment communities that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment homes to a diverse base of tenants. The primary financial measures for UDR’s apartment communities are rental income and NOI. Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. NOI is defined as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense which is calculated as

2.75%

of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations, and land rent. UDR’s chief operating decision maker utilizes NOI as the key measure of segment profit or loss.

UDR’s

two

reportable segments are

Same-Store Communities

and

Non-Mature Communities/Other

:

•

Same-Store Communities

represent those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2015

and held as of

December 31, 2016

. A comparison of operating results from the prior year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not held for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves

90%

occupancy for at least three consecutive months.

•

Non-Mature Communities/Other

represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in

Same-Store Communities

, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.

Management evaluates the performance of each of our apartment communities on a

Same-Store Community

and

Non-Mature Community/Other

basis, as well as individually and geographically. This is consistent with the aggregation criteria under GAAP as each of our apartment communities generally has similar economic characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore, the Company’s reportable segments have been aggregated by geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to the chief operating decision maker.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Partners

United Dominion Realty, L.P.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the “Partnership”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), changes in capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).  These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Partnership’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United Dominion Realty, L.P. at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein.

DECEMBER 31, 2016

1. CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

United Dominion Realty, L.P. (“UDR, L.P.,” the “Operating Partnership,” “we” or “our”) is a Delaware limited partnership that owns, acquires, renovates, redevelops, manages, and disposes of multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier to entry markets located in the United States. The high barrier to entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive single-family home prices and significant employment growth potential. UDR, L.P. is a subsidiary of UDR, Inc. (“UDR” or the “General Partner”), a self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, through which UDR conducts a significant portion of its business. During the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, rental revenues of the Operating Partnership represented

43%

,

51%

, and

52%

, respectively, of the General Partner’s consolidated rental revenues. At

December 31, 2016

, the Operating Partnership’s apartment portfolio consisted of


communities located in


markets consisting of

16,698

apartment homes.

Interests in UDR, L.P. are represented by operating partnership units (“OP Units”). The Operating Partnership’s net income is allocated to the partners, which is initially based on their respective distributions made during the year and secondly, their percentage interests. Distributions are made in accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of United Dominion Realty, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership Agreement”), on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the dividend per share on UDR’s common stock, which is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “UDR.”

As of

December 31, 2016

, there were

183,278,698

OP Units outstanding, of which

174,230,084

or

95.1%

were owned by UDR and affiliated entities and

9,048,614

or

4.9%

were owned by non-affiliated limited partners. There were

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-01,

Business Combinations (Topic 805), Clarifying the Definition of a Business.

The ASU changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether a set of transfered assets is a business. As a result, the accounting for acquisitions of real estate could be impacted. The updated standard will be effective for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2018; early adoption is permitted. The ASU will be applied prospectively to any transactions occurring within the period of adoption. The Operating Partnership expects that the updated standard will result in fewer acquisitions of real estate meeting the definition of a business and fewer acquisition-related costs being expensed in the period incurred.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Restricted Cash

. The ASU addresses the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The updated standard will be effective for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2018 and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented; early adoption is permitted. The Operating Partnership does not expect the updated standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

. The ASU addresses specific cash flow items with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice, including the treatment of distributions received from equity method investees. The updated standard will be effective

F -  59

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2016

for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2018 and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented; early adoption is permitted. The Operating Partnership elected to early adopt ASU 2016-15 in 2016. The adoption did not have an impact on the Operating Partnership’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

. The standard requires entities to estimate a lifetime expected credit loss for most financial assets, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, and to present the net amount of the financial instrument expected to be collected. The updated standard will be effective for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2020; early adoption is permitted on January 1, 2019. The Operating Partnership is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

. The ASU aims to simplify the accounting for share-based payments by amending the accounting for forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, classification in the statements of cash flow and income taxes. The updated standard will be effective for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The update requires a prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective approach, depending on the type of amendment. The Operating Partnership does not expect the updated standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases

. The standard amends the existing lease accounting guidance and requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (except for short-term leases that have a duration of one year or less) on their balance sheets. Lessees will continue to recognize lease expense in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, accounting for leases under the new guidance is substantially the same as in prior periods, but eliminates current real estate-specific provisions and changes the treatment of initial direct costs. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparable period presented, with an option to elect certain transition relief. Full retrospective application is prohibited. The standard will be effective for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. While the Operating Partnership is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect to recognize right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets related to ground leases on any communities where we are the lessee.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

, which makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model of consolidation. Under ASU 2015-02, companies will need to re-evaluate whether an entity meets the criteria to be considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”) or whether the consolidation of an entity should be assessed under the voting model. The new standard specifically eliminates the presumption in the current voting model that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless that presumption can be overcome. The new standard was effective for the Operating Partnership beginning on January 1, 2016. The adoption of the new standard did not result in the consolidation of entities not previously consolidated or the deconsolidation of any entities previously consolidated. Upon adopting the new standard, UDR Lighthouse DownREIT L.P. (the “DownREIT Partnership”) became a VIE as the limited partners lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. The Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the DownREIT Partnership and will continue to account for its interest as an equity method investment.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. The standard provides companies with a single model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The standard specifically excludes lease contracts. The ASU allows for the use of either the full or modified retrospective transition method and will be effective for the Operating Partnership on January 1, 2018, at which time the Operating Partnership expects to adopt the updated standard using the modified retrospective approach. However, as the majority of the Operating Partnership’s revenue is from rental income related to leases, the Operating Partnership does not expect the ASU to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Real Estate

Real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and other costs incurred during their development, acquisition and redevelopment.

F -  60

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2016

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition and/or improvement of real estate assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the expenditures qualify as a betterment or the life of the related asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life expectancy.

The Operating Partnership purchases real estate investment properties and records the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair value. The primary, although not only, identifiable intangible asset associated with our portfolio is the value of existing lease agreements. When recording the acquisition of a community, we first assign fair value to the estimated intangible value of the existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the land, building and fixtures assuming the community is vacant. The Operating Partnership estimates the intangible value of the lease agreements by determining the lost revenue associated with a hypothetical lease-up. Depreciation on the building is based on the expected useful life of the asset and the in-place leases are amortized over their remaining average contractual life. Property acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

Quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant, the Operating Partnership will assess our real estate properties for indicators of impairment. In determining whether the Operating Partnership has indicators of impairment in our real estate assets, we assess whether the long-lived asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s undiscounted future cash flows, which is representative of projected net operating income (“NOI”) plus the residual value of the community. Our future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. If such indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties classified as real estate held for disposition generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months. Real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less the cost to sell, determined on an asset-by-asset basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for disposition properties are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to held for disposition properties are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which are

35 to 55 years

for buildings,

10 to 35 years

for major improvements, and

3 to 10 years

for furniture, fixtures, equipment, and other assets.

Predevelopment, development, and redevelopment projects and related costs are capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as

Total real estate owned, net of accumulated depreciation

. The Operating Partnership capitalizes costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. These costs, excluding the direct costs of development and redevelopment and capitalized interest, for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


were

$0.6 million

,

$0.7 million

, and

$2.0 million

, respectively. During the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, total interest capitalized was

$0.2 million

,

$0.2 million

, and

$2.9 million

, respectively. As each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Operating Partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion and depreciation commences over the estimated useful life.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short-term, highly liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The majority of the Operating Partnership’s cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2016

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and security deposits.

Revenue and Real Estate Sales Gain Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents and tenants in accordance with GAAP. Rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis and recognized when earned. The Operating Partnership recognizes interest income, fees and incentives when earned, fixed and determinable.

For sale transactions meeting the requirements for full accrual profit recognition, we remove the related assets and liabilities from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and record the gain or loss in the period the transaction closes. For sale transactions that do not meet the full accrual sale criteria due to our continuing involvement, we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement and account for the transaction under an alternate method of accounting. Unless certain limited criteria are met, non-monetary transactions, including property exchanges, are accounted for at fair value.

Sales to entities in which we or our General Partner retain or otherwise own an interest are accounted for as partial sales. If all other requirements for recognizing profit under the full accrual method have been satisfied and no other forms of continuing involvement are present, we recognize profit proportionate to the outside interest in the buyer and defer the gain on the interest we or our General Partner retain. The Operating Partnership recognizes any deferred gain when the property is sold to a third party. In transactions accounted by us as partial sales, we determine if the buyer of the majority equity interest in the venture was provided a preference as to cash flows in either an operating or a capital waterfall. If a cash flow preference has been provided, we recognize profit only to the extent that proceeds from the sale of the majority equity interest exceed costs related to the entire property.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The General Partner utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. Derivative financial instruments associated with the Operating Partnership’s allocation of the General Partner’s debt are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability and measured quarterly at their fair value. The changes in fair value for the General Partner’s cash flow hedges allocated to the Operating Partnership that are deemed effective are reflected in other comprehensive income/(loss) and for non-designated derivative financial instruments in earnings. The ineffective component of cash flow hedges, if any, is recorded in earnings.

Noncontrolling Interests

The noncontrolling interests represent the General Partner’s interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries and are presented in the capital section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets since these interests are not convertible or redeemable into any other ownership interests of the Operating Partnership.

Income Taxes

The taxable income or loss of the Operating Partnership is reported on the tax returns of the partners. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements for federal or state income taxes on income that is passed through to the partners. However, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the Operating Partnership are recorded at the entity level. The Operating Partnership’s tax returns are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. Net income for financial reporting purposes differs from the net income for income tax reporting purposes primarily due to temporary differences, principally real estate depreciation and the tax deferral of certain gains on property sales. The differences in depreciation result from differences in the book and tax basis of certain real estate assets and the differences in the methods of depreciation and lives of the real estate assets.

The Operating Partnership evaluates the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Operating Partnership’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Management of the Operating Partnership is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. The Operating Partnership has no examinations in progress and none are expected at this time.

tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in future tax returns.

Discontinued Operations

In accordance with GAAP, a discontinued operation represents (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale in a single transaction and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s financial results, or (2) an acquired business that is classified as held for sale on the date of acquisition. A strategic shift could include a disposal of (1) a separate major line of business, (2) a separate major geographic area of operations, (3) a major equity method investment, or (4) other major parts of an entity.

We record sales of real estate that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation in

Gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned

4. UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

In October 2015, in connection with the acquisition of four properties from Home Properties, L.P., UDR, Inc., as the sole general partner and a limited partner, and the Operating Partnership, as limited partner, entered into the Agreement of Limited Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”) of the DownREIT Partnership. As of

December 31, 2016

, UDR, Inc. and the Operating Partnership owned approximately

9.3%

and

41.6%

, respectively, of the DownREIT Units, which they received in exchange for their contribution of properties to the DownREIT Partnership and cash of

$25.5 million

.

As the sole general partner of the DownREIT Partnership, UDR, Inc. has full, complete and exclusive discretion to manage and control the business of the DownREIT Partnership and to make all decisions affecting the business and assets of the DownREIT Partnership, subject to certain protective limitations set forth in the Partnership Agreement. The limited partners

F -  64

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2016

have no power to remove UDR, Inc. as the general partner of the DownREIT Partnership. The DownREIT Partnership is structured to make distributions in respect of DownREIT Units that will be equivalent to the distributions made to holders of UDR, Inc.’s common stock. Subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Partnership Agreement, limited partners in the DownREIT Partnership (other than UDR, Inc. and its affiliates) have the right, commencing one year after the date of issuance, to tender their DownREIT Units for redemption for cash or, at UDR Inc.’s election, for shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to the anti-dilution adjustments provided in the Partnership Agreement).

The DownREIT Partnership is accounted for by the Operating Partnership under the equity method of accounting and is included in

Investment in unconsolidated entities

7. FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are described below:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

F -  69

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2016

Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value

The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate options are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities.

The General Partner, on behalf of the Operating Partnership, incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Operating Partnership has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

Although the General Partner, on behalf of the Operating Partnership, has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

, the Operating Partnership has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Operating Partnership has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In conjunction with the FASB’s fair value measurement guidance, the Operating Partnership made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

At

December 31, 2016

, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaids, real estate taxes payable, accrued interest payable, security deposits and prepaid rent, distributions payable and accounts payable approximated their carrying values because of the short term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair values of other financial instruments were determined by the Operating Partnership using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Operating Partnership would realize on the disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The General Partner estimates the fair value of our debt instruments by discounting the remaining cash flows of the debt instrument at a discount rate equal to the replacement market credit spread plus the corresponding treasury yields. Factors considered in determining a replacement market credit spread include general market conditions, borrower specific credit spreads, time remaining to maturity, loan-to-value ratios and collateral quality (Level 3).

The Operating Partnership records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets. Cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect management’s best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value. The General Partner’s estimates of fair value represent management’s estimates based upon Level 3 inputs such as industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

8. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITY

Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Operating Partnership is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The General Partner principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The General Partner manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and

F -  70

UNITED DOMINION REALTY, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2016

credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the General Partner enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The General Partner’s and the Operating Partnership’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the General Partner’s known or expected cash payments principally related to the General Partner’s borrowings.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The General Partner’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the General Partner primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the General Partner making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up front premium.

A portion of the General Partner’s interest rate derivatives has been allocated to the Operating Partnership based on the General Partner’s underlying debt instruments allocated to the Operating Partnership. (See Note 5,

Debt, Net.

)

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the Operating Partnership recorded

no

gain or loss from ineffectiveness. During the year ended

December 31, 2015

, the Operating Partnership recognized a loss of less than

$0.1 million

reclassified from

Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net

to

Interest expense

due to the de-designation of a cash flow hedge and recorded no other ineffectiveness to earnings. During the year ended December 31,


, the Operating Partnership recorded

no

gain or loss from ineffectiveness.

Amounts reported in

Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net

related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the General Partner’s variable-rate debt that is allocated to the Operating Partnership. Through December 31, 2017, we estimate that less than

$0.1 million

will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

As of

, the Operating Partnership had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (

):

Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Operating Partnership’s exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of GAAP.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features

The General Partner has agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if the General Partner defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the General Partner could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations; or (2) the General Partner could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the General Partner’s default on the indebtedness.

Certain of the General Partner’s agreements with its derivative counterparties contain provisions where if there is a change in the General Partner’s financial condition that materially changes the General Partner’s creditworthiness in an adverse manner, the General Partner may be required to fully collateralize its obligations under the derivative instrument. At

December 31, 2016

and


,

no

cash collateral was posted or required to be posted by the General Partner or by a counterparty.

The General Partner also has an agreement with a derivative counterparty that incorporates the loan and financial covenant provisions of the General Partner’s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with these covenant provisions would result in the General Partner being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement.

DECEMBER 31, 2016

The General Partner has certain agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where in the event of default by the General Partner or the counterparty, the right of setoff may be exercised. Any amount payable to one party by the other party may be reduced by its setoff against any amounts payable by the other party. Events that give rise to default by either party may include, but are not limited to, the failure to pay or deliver payment under the derivative agreement, the failure to comply with or perform under the derivative agreement, bankruptcy, a merger without assumption of the derivative agreement, or in a merger, a surviving entity’s creditworthiness is materially weaker than the original party to the derivative agreement.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position that were allocated to the Operating Partnership, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was

9. CAPITAL STRUCTURE

General Partnership Units

The General Partner has complete discretion to manage and control the operations and business of the Operating Partnership, which includes but is not limited to the acquisition and disposition of real property, construction of buildings and making capital improvements, and the borrowing of funds from outside lenders or UDR and its subsidiaries to finance such activities. The General Partner can generally authorize, issue, sell, redeem or purchase any OP Unit or securities of the Operating Partnership without the approval of the limited partners. The General Partner can also approve, with regard to the issuances of OP Units, the class or one or more series of classes, with designations, preferences, participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties including rights, powers and duties senior to limited partnership interests without approval of

and


, there were

183,167,815

limited partnership units outstanding, of which

1,873,332

were Class A Limited Partnership Units. UDR owned

of OP Units units outstanding were held by non-affiliated partners at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, of which

1,751,671

were Class A Limited Partnership Units.

Subject to the terms of the Operating Partnership Agreement, the limited partners have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the Operating Partnership Agreement), provided that such OP Units have been outstanding for at least

one

year. UDR, as general partner of the Operating Partnership, may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of common stock of UDR for each OP Unit), as defined in the Operating Partnership Agreement.

The non-affiliated limited partners’ capital is adjusted to redemption value at the end of each reporting period with the corresponding offset against UDR’s limited partner capital account based on the redemption rights noted above. The aggregate value upon redemption of the then-outstanding OP Units held by limited partners was

$330.1 million

and

$340.1 million

as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, based on the value of UDR’s common stock at each period end. A limited partner has no right to receive any distributions from the Operating Partnership on or after the date of redemption of its OP Units.

Class A Limited Partnership Units

Class A Limited Partnership Units have a cumulative, annual, non-compounded preferred return, which is equal to

8%

based on a value of

$16.61

per Class A Limited Partnership Unit.

Holders of the Class A Limited Partnership Units exclusively possess certain voting rights. The Operating Partnership may not do the following without approval of the holders of the Class A Limited Partnership Units: (i) increase the authorized or issued amount of Class A Limited Partnership Units, (ii) reclassify any other partnership interest into Class A Limited Partnership Units, (iii) create, authorize or issue any obligations or security convertible into or the right to purchase Class A Limited Partnership Units, (iv) enter into a merger or acquisition, or (v) amend or modify the Operating Partnership Agreement in a manner that adversely affects the relative rights, preferences or privileges of the Class A Limited Partnership Units.

LTIP Units

UDR grants long-term incentive plan units ("LTIP Units") to certain employees and non-employee directors. The LTIP Units represent an ownership interest in the Operating Partnership and have voting and distribution rights consistent with OP Units. The LTIP Units are subject to the terms of UDR's long-term incentive plan.

Two classes of LTIP Units are granted, Class 1 LTIP Units and Class 2 LTIP Units. Class 1 LTIP Units are granted to non-employee directors and vest after one year. Class 2 LTIP Units are granted to certain employees and vest over a period from one to three years subject to certain performance and market conditions being achieved. Vested LTIP Units may be converted into OP Units provided that such LTIP Units have been outstanding for at least two years from the date of grant.

Allocation of Profits and Losses

Profit of the Operating Partnership is allocated in the following order: (i) to the General Partner and the Limited Partners in proportion to and up to the amount of cash distributions made during the year, and (ii) to the General Partner and Limited Partners in accordance with their percentage interests. Losses and depreciation and amortization expenses, non-recourse liabilities are allocated to the General Partner and Limited Partners in accordance with their percentage interests. Losses allocated to the Limited Partners are capped to the extent that such an allocation would not cause a deficit in the Limited Partners’ capital account. Such losses are, therefore, allocated to the General Partner. If any Partner’s capital balance were to fall into a deficit, any income and gains are allocated to each Partner sufficient to eliminate its negative capital balance.

Contingencies

Litigation and Legal Matters

The Operating Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Operating Partnership cannot determine the ultimate liability with respect to such legal proceedings and claims at this time. The General Partner believes that such liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on the Operating Partnership’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

11. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

GAAP guidance requires that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker to decide how to allocate resources and for purposes of assessing such segments’ performance. The Operating Partnership has the same chief operating decision maker as that of its parent, the General Partner. The chief operating decision maker consists of several members of UDR’s executive management team who use several generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance of the business for our reportable operating segments.

The Operating Partnership owns and operates multifamily apartment communities throughout the United States that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment homes to a diverse base of tenants. The primary financial measures of the Operating Partnership’s apartment communities are rental income and NOI, and are included in the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of the Operating Partnership’s performance on a consolidated basis. Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. NOI is defined as total revenues less direct property operating expenses. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI are property management costs, which are the Operating Partnership’s allocable share of costs incurred by the General Partner for shared services of corporate level property management employees and related support functions and costs. The chief operating decision maker of the General Partner utilizes NOI as the key measure of segment profit or loss.

The Operating Partnership’s

two

reportable segments are

Same-Store Communities

and

Non-Mature Communities/Other

:

•

Same-Store Communities

represent those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to

January 1, 2015

and held as of

December 31, 2016

. A comparison of operating results from the prior year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not held for disposition within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves

90%

occupancy for at least three consecutive months.

•

Non-Mature Communities/Other

represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in

Same-Store Communities

, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties.

Management of the General Partner evaluates the performance of each of the Operating Partnership's apartment communities on a

Same-Store Community

and

Non-Mature Community/Other

basis, as well as individually and geographically. This is consistent with the aggregation criteria under GAAP as each of our apartment communities generally has similar economic characteristics, facilities, services, and tenants. Therefore, the Operating Partnership’s reportable segments have been aggregated by geography in a manner identical to that which is provided to the chief operating decision maker.

All revenues are from external customers and

no

single tenant or related group of tenants contributed

10% or more

of the Operating Partnership’s total revenues during the years ended
