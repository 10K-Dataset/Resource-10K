PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. is a
self-administered equity real estate investment trust, or REIT,
that owns, acquires, renovates, develops and manages
middle-market apartment communities nationwide. At
December 31, 2003, our apartment portfolio included 264
communities located in 55 markets, with a total of 76,244
completed apartment homes. In addition, we had three apartment
communities under development.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. To continue to qualify as a REIT,
we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other
things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of
real estate, our income be derived primarily from real estate,
and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income
(other than our net capital gain) to our stockholders. As a
qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal
income taxes on our REIT taxable income to the extent we
distribute such income to our stockholders. In 2003, we declared
total distributions of $1.14 per share to our stockholders,
which represents our 27th year of consecutive dividend increases
to our stockholders.

We were formed in 1972 as a Virginia corporation.
In June 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from
Virginia to Maryland. Our corporate headquarters is located at
400 East Cary Street, Richmond, Virginia. Our principal
executive offices are located at 1745 Shea Center Drive,
Suite 200, Highlands Ranch, Colorado. As of
February 18, 2004, we had 1,832 full-time employees
and 180 part-time employees.

Our subsidiaries include two operating
partnerships, Heritage Communities L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership, and United Dominion Realty L.P., a limited
partnership that changed its state of organization from Virginia
to Delaware in February 2004. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all references in this Report to “we,”
“us,” “our,” “the company,” or
“United Dominion” refer collectively to United
Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

2003 Accomplishments



Business Objectives and Operating
Strategies

Our principal business objective is to maximize
the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our
stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value.
To achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the
following goals and strategies:

Acquisitions

During 2003, using the proceeds from our
disposition program and our equity offerings, we acquired 21
communities with 5,220 apartment homes at a total cost of
approximately $423.7 million, including the assumption of
debt and the use of tax-free exchange funds. In addition, we
purchased one parcel of land for $3.1 million.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we
consider:

The following table summarizes our apartment
acquisitions and year-end ownership position for the past five
years (

dollars in thousands

):



Dispositions

We regularly monitor and adjust our assets to
increase portfolio profitability. During 2003, we sold over
1,900 of our slower growing, non-core apartment homes while
exiting some markets in an effort to increase the quality and
performance of our portfolio. Proceeds from the disposition
program were used primarily to reduce debt and fund acquisitions.

Factors we consider in deciding whether to
dispose of a property include:

At December 31, 2003, there was one
apartment community and one parcel of land classified as real
estate held for disposition. We are in the market for
replacement properties that will correspond with our expected
sales activity to prevent dilution to earnings.

Upgrading and Development Activities

During 2003, we continued to reposition
properties in targeted markets where there was an opportunity to
add value and achieve greater than inflationary increases in
rents over the long term. In 2003, we spent $12.2 million
to develop 178 apartment homes as an additional phase to an
existing community. In addition, revenue enhancing capital
expenditures, including water sub-metering, the initial
installation of microwaves or washer-dryers and extensive
interior upgrades totaled $15.4 million or $207 per
home for the year ended December 31, 2003.

The following wholly-owned projects were under
development as of December 31, 2003:

In addition, we owned six parcels of land held
for future development aggregating $7.8 million at
December 31, 2003. Five of the six parcels represent
additional phases to existing properties.

In September 2002, we entered into a development
joint venture with AEGON USA Realty Advisors, Inc. in which
we are serving as the managing member. The joint venture is
expected to develop approximately eight to ten garden-style
apartment communities over the next three years, with a total
development cost of up to $210 million. The joint venture
will obtain bank construction financing for 65% to 80% of total
costs and will provide equity contributions for the balance of
the costs with AEGON providing 80% and us providing 20%. We are
serving as the developer, general contractor and property
manager for the joint venture and have guaranteed those project
development costs, excluding financing costs (including fees and
interest), which exceed the defined project cost budgeted
amounts for each respective project, as they come to fruition.
We believe that the likelihood of funding guarantor obligations
is remote and that the impact to us would be immaterial. In June
2003, we contributed land with a carrying value of
$3.8 million to the joint venture.



The following joint venture project was under
development as of December 31, 2003:

We will continue to seek out development and
redevelopment opportunities in our core markets and may seek to
raise equity with other potential joint venture partners to
start new development programs over the next five years.

Financing Activities

As part of our plan to strengthen our capital
structure, we utilized proceeds from dispositions, equity
offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down
existing debt, and acquire apartment communities. The following
is a list of our major financing activities in 2003:



Markets and Competitive Conditions

At December 31, 2003, we owned 264 apartment
communities in 55 markets in 19 states. Of those markets,
22 markets, or 40%, generated positive same community net
operating income growth. We have a geographically diverse
portfolio and we believe that this diversification increases
investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with
cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby
increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings.

We believe changing demographics will have a
significant impact on the apartment industry over the next two
decades. In particular, we believe the annual number of young
people entering the workforce and creating households will be
significantly higher over the next 10 to 15 years as
compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past
10 years. The number of single people and single parent
households continues to grow significantly. The immigrant
population is also expected to grow at an accelerated pace. Each
of these population segments has a high propensity to rent.

Despite a strengthening United States economy,
significant productivity growth has adversely affected
employment growth, which is the primary driver of demand in our
business. In addition, a sustained low mortgage interest rate
environment, combined with government and builder incentives to
first time home buyers, has further siphoned off what would
traditionally be demand for apartment homes. To maintain
occupancy levels during these economic conditions, we have
increased our marketing expenses and provided certain
concessions to our residents.

In most of our markets, competition for new
residents is intense. Some competing communities offer features
that our communities do not have. Competing communities
frequently use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary
competitive advantages. Also, some competing communities are
larger or newer than our communities. The competitive position
of each community is different depending upon many factors
including sub-market supply and demand. In addition, other real
estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties
and to develop new properties. These competitors include
insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer
partnerships, investment companies and other apartment REITs.
This competition could increase prices for properties of the
type that we would likely pursue, and our competitors may have
greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do.



We believe that, in general, we are
well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and
investments. We believe our competitive advantages include:

Moving forward, we will continue to emphasize
aggressive lease management, expense control, increased resident
retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive
plans tied to our bottom line performance. We believe this plan
of operations, coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in
targeting the middle-market of renters across a geographically
diverse platform, should position us for continued operational
improvement.

Communities

At December 31, 2003, our apartment
portfolio included 264 communities having a total of 76,244
completed apartment homes. In addition, we had three apartment
communities under development. The overall quality of our
portfolio has significantly improved since 2001 with the
disposition of non-core apartment homes and the upgrading of
most of our communities. The upgrading of the portfolio provides
several key benefits related to portfolio profitability. It
enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract
residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more
likely to accept the transfer of expenses, such as water and
sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. In addition, it
potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment
home, and therefore increases future cash flow.

Same Communities

For 2003, same community property operating
income decreased 4.2% or $14.9 million compared to 2002.
The overall decrease in property operating income was primarily
attributable to a 1.8% or $9.9 million decrease in revenues
from rental and other income and a 2.5% or $5.0 million
increase in operating expenses. The decrease in revenues from
rental and other income was primarily driven by a 2.2% or
$12.8 million decrease in rental rates. This decrease in
income was partially offset by an 11.7% or $1.7 million
increase in sub-meter, gas, trash and utility reimbursements, a
5.5% or $1.0 million decrease in concession expense and a
1.7% or $0.7 million decrease in vacancy loss. Physical
occupancy remained constant at 93.2% for both 2003 and 2002.

The increase in property operating expenses was
primarily driven by a 17.6% or $1.7 million increase in
insurance costs, a 4.3% or $1.4 million increase in
utilities expense, a 2.4% or $0.9 million increase in
repair and maintenance costs, a 3.9% or $0.8 million
increase in administrative and marketing costs, a 0.7% or
$0.4 million increase in personnel costs, and a 0.8% or
$0.4 million increase in taxes, all of which were partially
offset by a 17.6% or $0.2 million decrease in incentive
compensation.

Customers

We focus on the broad middle-market segment of
the apartment market that generally consists of
renters-by-necessity. This group includes young professionals,
blue-collar families, single parent households, older singles,
immigrants, non-related parties and families renting while
waiting to purchase a home. We believe this segment provides the
highest profit potential in terms of rent growth, stability of
occupancy and investment opportunities.

We believe there will be a significant increase
in the number of younger renters over the next 10 to
15 years, and that the immigrant population will remain a
significant and growing part of the renter base.



Accordingly, we plan to target some of our
incremental investments to communities that will be attractive
to younger households or to the immigrant populations. These
communities will often be located close to where these residents
work, shop and play.

Tax Matters

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must
continue to meet certain tests that, among other things,
generally require that our assets consist primarily of real
estate, our income be derived primarily from real estate and
that we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (other
than our net capital gain) to our stockholders. Provided we
maintain our qualification as a REIT, we will generally not be
subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level on our
net income to the extent net income is distributed to our
stockholders.

Inflation

Substantially all of our leases are for a term of
one year or less, which may enable us to realize increased rents
upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases.
Such short-term leases generally minimize the risk to us of the
adverse effects of inflation, although as a general rule these
leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term
without penalty. Short-term leases and relatively consistent
demand allow rents, and therefore cash flow from the portfolio,
to provide an attractive hedge against inflation.

Environmental Matters

To date, compliance with federal, state and local
environmental protection regulations has not had a material
effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position. However, in the past, the issue has been raised
regarding the presence of asbestos and other hazardous materials
in existing real estate properties, and within the past year
there has been an increase in the number of claims of potential
health-related issues allegedly caused by the presence of mold
in confined spaces. We have a property management plan for
hazardous materials. As part of the plan, Phase I
environmental site investigations and reports have been
completed for each property we own. In addition, all proposed
acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. The inspections
are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we
review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of
any property. Nevertheless, it is possible that our
environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental
liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities
exist of which we are unaware. In some cases, we have abandoned
otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs
of removal or control of hazardous materials have been
prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential
risks involved. We do not believe we will be required to engage
in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. We
believe that through professional environmental inspections and
testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials,
coupled with a conservative posture toward accepting known risk,
we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated
with environmental hazards.

Federal legislation requires owners and landlords
of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to
potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known
lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to
provide such notification. In addition, lead based paint in any
of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children
residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead
based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state
laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based
paint by children living at the communities.

We are unaware of any environmental hazards at
any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may
have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial
position. We have not been notified by any governmental
authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material
non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental
liabilities in connection with any of our properties. We do not
believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable
environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse
effect on us or our financial condition or results of
operations. Future environmental



laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may
require additional remediation of existing conditions that are
not currently actionable. Also, if more stringent requirements
are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could
have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage
on our communities, with limits of liability customary within
the industry to insure against liability claims and related
defense costs. We are also insured, in all material respects,
against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary
to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred
to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental
income during the reconstruction period.

Factors Affecting Our Business and
Prospects

There are many factors that affect our business
and our results of operations, some of which are beyond our
control. The following is a description of some of the important
factors that may cause our actual results of operations in
future periods to differ materially from those currently
expected or desired.

Unfavorable Changes in Apartment Market and
Economic Conditions Could Adversely Affect Occupancy Levels and
Rental Rates.

Market and economic
conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may
significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and,
therefore, our profitability. Factors that may adversely affect
these conditions include the following:

The strength of the United States economy has
become increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of
terrorism. At the same time, productivity enhancements and the
increased exportation of labor have resulted in negligible job
growth despite an improving economy. Continued weakness in job
creation, or any worsening of current economic conditions,
generally and in our principal market areas, could have a
material adverse effect on our occupancy levels, our rental
rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of
apartment communities. This may impair our ability to satisfy
our financial obligations and pay distributions to our
stockholders.

Acquisitions or New Development May Not
Achieve Anticipated Results.

We intend
to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that
meet our investment criteria. Our acquisition activities and
their success are subject to the following risks:

•

an acquired community may fail to perform as we
    expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure
    related to the acquired property may go undetected during our
    due diligence procedures,

•

when we acquire an apartment community, we often
    invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing
    profitability. These additional investments may not produce the
    anticipated improvements in profitability, and

•

new developments may not achieve pro forma rents
    or occupancy levels, or problems with construction or local
    building codes may delay initial occupancy dates for all or a
    portion of a development community.



Possible Difficulty of Selling Apartment
Communities Could Limit Operational and Financial
Flexibility.

We periodically dispose
of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic
objectives, but market conditions could change and purchasers
may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us. A weak market
may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in
response to changing economic conditions. Furthermore, a
significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property
sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to
qualify as like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the
Internal Revenue Code, so that any related capital gain can be
deferred for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may
not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from
our property sales. In addition, federal tax laws limit our
ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned
for fewer than four years, and this limitation may prevent us
from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.

Increased Competition Could Limit Our Ability
to Lease Apartment Homes or Increase or Maintain
Rents.

Our apartment communities
compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting
residents, including other apartment communities and
single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single-and
multi-family homes. Competitive housing in a particular area
could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and
increase or maintain rents.

Insufficient Cash Flow Could Affect Our Debt
Financing and Create Refinancing Risk.

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt
financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash
flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal
and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our
line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. We cannot assure
you that sufficient cash flow will be available to make all
required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution
requirements to maintain our status as a REIT, nor can we assure
you that the full limits of our line of credit will be available
to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints
of our debt covenants. Additionally, we are likely to need to
refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it
matures. We may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the
terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of
the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets
or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose
to do so.

Failure to Generate Sufficient Revenue Could
Impair Debt Service Payments and Distributions to
Stockholders.

If our apartment
communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet
rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of
interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay
distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected.
The following factors, among others, may affect the net rental
income generated by our apartment communities:

Expenses associated with our investment in a
community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance
and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when
circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that
community. If a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt
and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could
sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or
the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder.

Debt Level May Be
Increased.

Our current debt policy
does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we
may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by
covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. We manage our
debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject
to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount
of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our
ability to service the additional debt.



Financing May Not Be Available and Could be
Dilutive.

Our ability to execute our
business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend
of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other
forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing,
including common and preferred equity. Debt or equity financing
may not be available in sufficient amounts, or on favorable
terms or at all. If we issue additional equity securities to
finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt,
the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted.

Development and Construction Risks Could
Impact Our Profitability.

We intend to
continue to develop and construct apartment communities.
Development activities may be conducted through wholly-owned
affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated
parties. Our development and construction activities may be
exposed to the following risks:

Construction costs have been increasing in our
existing markets, and the costs of upgrading acquired
communities have, in some cases, exceeded our original
estimates. We may experience similar cost increases in the
future. Our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to
offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair
our profitability.

Failure to Succeed in New Markets May Limit
Our Growth.

We may from time to time
make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if
appropriate opportunities arise. We may be exposed to a variety
of risks if we choose to enter new markets, and we may not be
able to operate successfully in new markets. These risks
include, among others:

Changing Interest Rates Could Increase
Interest Costs and Could Affect the Market Price of Our
Securities.

We currently have, and
expect to incur in the future, debt bearing interest at rates
that vary with market interest rates. Therefore, if interest
rates increase, our interest costs will rise to the extent our
variable rate debt is not hedged effectively. In addition, an
increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders
to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect
the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt
securities.

Limited Investment Opportunities Could
Adversely Affect Our Growth.

We expect
that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire
existing properties and to develop new properties. These
competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment
funds, developer partnerships, investment



companies and other apartment REITs. This
competition could increase prices for properties of the type
that we would likely pursue, and our competitors may have
greater resources than we do. As a result, we may not be able to
make attractive investments on favorable terms, which could
adversely affect our growth.

Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities and
New Personnel Could Create
Inefficiencies.

To grow successfully,
we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing
portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of
properties. In addition, we must be able to integrate new
management and operations personnel as our organization grows in
size and complexity. Failures in either area will result in
inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return
on our investments and our overall profitability.

Interest Rate Hedging Contracts May Be
Ineffective and May Result in Material
Charges.

From time to time when we
anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period
prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest
rate hedging contracts. We may do this to increase the
predictability of our financing costs. Also, from time to time
we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our
exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in
market interest rates. If the pricing of new debt securities is
not within the parameters of, or market interest rates produce a
lower interest cost than that which we incur under a particular
interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective.
Furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts
has involved and may in the future involve material charges.

Potential Liability for Environmental
Contamination Could Result in Substantial
Costs.

Under various federal, state
and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or
operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and
remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly
owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often
regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the
contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former
ownership or operation of the real estate. In addition, we could
be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties
for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs
incurred in connection with the contamination. These costs could
be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create
liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their
payment. The presence of such substances or a failure to
properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially
and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent
an affected property.

We are Subject to Certain Tax
Risks.

We have elected to be taxed as
a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, we
must satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and
quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex
Internal Revenue Code provisions. Only limited judicial or
administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and
involves the determination of various factual matters and
circumstances not entirely within our control. In addition,
U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs and other
corporations and the administrative interpretations of those
laws may be amended at any time. Future legislation, new
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions
may apply to us, potentially with retroactive effect, and could
adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or adversely
affect our stockholders. We may receive significant
non-qualifying income or acquire non-qualifying assets, which as
a result, may cause us to approach the income and assets test
limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. There is a risk
that we may not satisfy these tests. If we fail to qualify as a
REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income
tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. We may also be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year in which we failed to qualify. This would
reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution
to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. Even if
we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject
to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and
property.

Recent Tax Legislation Could Negatively Impact
Our Stock Price.

In 2003, legislation
was enacted that generally reduces the maximum capital gains
rate for non-corporate taxpayers from 20% to 15% after
May 5, 2003. Under the legislation, the 15% rate is also
applicable to “qualified dividend income” from



certain corporations. In general, dividends
payable by REITs are not eligible for the 15% tax rate, except
to the extent such dividends are attributable to dividends we
received from taxable corporations (such as our taxable REIT
subsidiaries) or to REIT “capital gain dividends” as
defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The recent
legislation also reduces the maximum tax rate of non-corporate
taxpayers on ordinary income from 38.6% to 35%.

Although this legislation does not adversely
affect the taxation of REITs or dividends paid by REITs, the
more favorable treatment of regular corporate dividends could
cause investors who are individuals to consider stock of other
corporations that pay dividends as more attractive relative to
stock of REITs. It is not possible to predict whether this
change in perceived relative value will occur, or what the
effect will be on the market price of our stock.

We may conduct a portion of our business
through taxable REIT subsidiaries, which could have adverse tax
consequences.

We have established
several taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite our qualification as
a REIT, our taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay federal income
tax on their taxable income. In addition, we must comply with
various tests to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our
taxable REIT subsidiaries generally do not constitute
permissible income and investments for these tests. While we
will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable REIT
subsidiaries will not adversely affect our REIT qualification,
we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve
that result. Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty
tax, or our taxable REIT subsidiaries may be denied deductions,
to the extent our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries
are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature.

Maryland Law May Limit the Ability of a Third
Party to Acquire Control of Us, Which May Not be in Our
Stockholders’ Best Interests.

Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third
party to acquire control of us. As a Maryland corporation, we
are subject to various Maryland laws which may have the effect
of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing
the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our
acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests.
The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other
business combination transactions between us and any person who
acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock
representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board
of directors’ prior approval. Any such business combination
transaction could not be completed until five years after the
person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the
approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled
to be cast and 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast,
excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair
price. Maryland law also provides generally that a person who
acquires shares of our equity stock that represent 10% (and
certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors
will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of
two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote.

Limitations on Share Ownership and Limitations
on the Ability of Our Stockholders to Effect a Change in Control
of Our Company May Prevent Takeovers That are Beneficial to Our
Stockholders.

One of the requirements
for maintenance of our qualification as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our
outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer
individuals, including entities specified in the Internal
Revenue Code, during the last half of any taxable year. Our
amended and restated articles of incorporation contain ownership
and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to
assist us in complying with this requirement. These restrictions
include a provision that generally limits a person from
beneficially owning or constructively owning shares of our
outstanding equity stock in excess of a 9.9% ownership interest,
unless our board of directors exempts the person from such
ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not
allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding
equity stock. These provisions may have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even
though a change of control might involve a premium price for our
stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’
best interests.

Under the terms of our shareholder rights plan,
our board of directors can, in effect, prevent a person or group
from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our
common stock. Unless our board of directors approves the
person’s purchase, after that person acquires more than 15%
of our outstanding



common stock, all other stockholders will have
the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less
than their then fair market value. Purchases by other
stockholders would substantially reduce the value and influence
of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person.
Our board of directors, however, can prevent the shareholder
rights plan from operating in this manner. This gives our board
of directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a
person’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to various legal proceedings and
claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We cannot
determine the ultimate liability with respect to such legal
proceedings and claims at this time. We believe that such
liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or
otherwise, will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

PART II

Item 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY,
    RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY
    SECURITIES

Common Stock

Our common stock is traded on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol “UDR.” The following
tables set forth the quarterly high and low sale prices per
common share reported on the NYSE



for each quarter of the last two years.
Distribution information for common stock reflects distributions
declared per share for each calendar quarter and paid at the end
of the following month.

On February 18, 2004, the closing sale price
of our common stock was $18.58 per share on the NYSE and
there were 7,287 holders of record of the 127,422,160
outstanding shares of our common stock.

We have determined that, for federal income tax
purposes, approximately 71% of the distributions for each of the
four quarters of 2003 represented ordinary income, 9%
represented long-term capital gain, 2% represented unrecaptured
section 1250 gain and 18% represented return of capital to
our stockholders.

We pay regular quarterly distributions to holders
of shares of our common stock. Future distributions will be at
the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our
actual funds from operations, financial condition and capital
requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the
REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and other factors.
The annual distribution payment for calendar year 2003 necessary
for us to maintain our status as a REIT was approximately
$0.73 per share. We declared total distributions of
$1.14 per share for 2003.

Series B Preferred Stock

The Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock has no stated par value and a liquidation preference of
$25 per share. The Series B has no voting rights
except as required by law. The Series B has no stated
maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory
redemption and is not convertible into any of our other
securities. The Series B is not redeemable prior to
May 29, 2007. On or after this date, the Series B may
be redeemed for cash at our option, in whole or in part, at a
redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid
dividends. The redemption price is payable solely out of the
sale proceeds of our other capital stock. All dividends due and
payable on the Series B have been accrued or paid as of the
end of each fiscal year.

Distributions declared on the Series B in
2003 were $2.15 per share or $.5375 per quarter. The
Series B is listed on the NYSE under the symbol
“UDRpfb.”

Series D Preferred Stock

The Series D Cumulative Convertible
Redeemable Preferred Stock has no stated par value and a
liquidation preference of $25 per share. The Series D
has no voting rights except as required by law. In addition, if
Series D dividends are in arrears for any dividend period,
the holders of the Series D have rights to notices and
voting entitlements of holders of common stock until all
accumulated dividends for all past dividend periods and the then
current dividend period have been paid or set aside for payment.
The Series D has no stated maturity, is not subject to any
sinking fund or mandatory redemption, and is convertible into
1.5385 shares of common stock, subject to certain
adjustments, at the option of the holder of the Series D at
any time. We may, at our option, redeem at any time all or part
of the Series D at a



price per share of $25, payable in cash, plus all
accrued and unpaid dividends, provided that the current market
price of our common stock at least equals the conversion price,
initially set at $16.25 per share. The redemption is
payable solely out of the sale proceeds of other capital stock;
provided, however, that we may not redeem, in any consecutive
twelve-month period, a number of shares of Series D having
an aggregate liquidation preference of more than
$100 million, subject to certain exceptions.

In 2003, we exercised our right to redeem
6.0 million shares of our Series D. Upon receipt of
our redemption notice, the shares to be redeemed were converted
by the holder into 9,230,923 shares of common stock at a
price of $16.25 per share. Because the shares of common
stock were sold in a transaction not involving a public
offering, the transaction is exempt from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933 in accordance with Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act.

Distributions declared on the Series D in
2003 were $2.04 per share or $.5089 per quarter. The
Series D is not listed on any exchange.

Series E Preferred Stock

The Series E Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock has no stated par value and a liquidation
preference of $16.61 per share. Subject to certain
adjustments and conditions, each share of the Series E is
convertible at any time and from time to time at the
holder’s option into one share of our common stock. The
holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on an
as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the
holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for
the election of directors or for any other purpose on which the
holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E
has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or
any mandatory redemption.

Distributions declared on the Series E in
2003 were $0.84 per share, $0.18 per share in the
second quarter and $0.33 per share in each of the third and
fourth quarters. The Series E is not listed on any exchange.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan

We have a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan under which holders of our common and preferred
stock may elect to automatically reinvest their distributions
and make additional cash payments to acquire additional shares
of our common stock. Stockholders who do not participate in the
plan continue to receive dividends as declared. As of
February 18, 2004, there were 4,000 participants in the
plan.

Operating Partnership Units

From time to time we issue shares of our common
stock in exchange for operating partnership units, or
OP Units, tendered to our operating partnerships, United
Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage Communities L.P., for
redemption in accordance with the provisions of their respective
partnership agreements. At December 31, 2003, there were
10,129,492 OP Units and 269,973 OP Units in United
Dominion Realty, L.P. and Heritage Communities L.P.,
respectively, that were owned by limited partners. The holder of
the OP Units has the right to require United Dominion
Realty, L.P. to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units
held by the holder in exchange for a cash payment based on the
market value of our common stock at the time of redemption.
However, United Dominion Realty, L.P.’s obligation to pay
the cash amount is subject to the prior right of the company to
acquire such OP Units in exchange for either the cash
amount or shares of our common stock. Heritage Communities L.P.
OP Units are convertible into common stock in lieu of cash,
at our option, once the holder elects to convert, at an exchange
ratio of 1.575 shares for each OP Unit. During 2003,
we issued a total of 216,983 shares of common stock in
exchange for OP Units.



Item 6.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table sets forth selected
consolidated financial and other information as of and for each
of the years in the five-year period ended December 31,
2003. The table should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included
elsewhere in this Report.



UNITED DOMINION REALTY
TRUST, INC.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

(In thousands, except per share data and
apartment homes owned)



(a)

Funds from operations (“FFO”) is
    defined as net income (computed in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses)
    from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and
    amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated
    partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with
    the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s
    definition issued in April 2002. We consider FFO in evaluating
    property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe
    that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an
    alternative to, net income and cash flows as a measure of our
    activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available
    to fund cash needs. For 2001, FFO includes a non-recurring
    charge of $8.6 million related to workforce reductions,
    other severance costs, executive office relocation costs and the
    write down of seven undeveloped land sites along with our
    investment in an online apartment leasing company. For 2000, FFO
    includes a non-recurring charge of $3.7 million related to
    the settlement of litigation and an organizational charge.

(b)

Gains on the disposition of real estate
    investments developed for sale is defined as net sales proceeds
    less a tax provision (such development by REITs must be
    conducted in a taxable REIT subsidiary) and the gross investment
    basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation. We consider
    FFO with gains (or losses) on real estate development for sale
    to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because
    of the short-term use of funds to produce a profit which differs
    from the traditional long-term investment in real estate for
    REITs.

(c)

Reclassified to conform to current year
    presentation as described in Note 3 to the consolidated
    financial statements.



Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

results or conditions described in such statements or our
objectives and plans will be achieved.

Business Overview

We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT,
that owns, acquires, renovates, develops and manages
middle-market apartment communities nationwide. We were formed
in 1972 as a Virginia corporation, and we changed our state of
incorporation from Virginia to Maryland in June 2003. Our
subsidiaries include two operating partnerships, Heritage
Communities L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and United
Dominion Realty, L.P., a limited partnership which changed its
state of organization from Virginia to Delaware in February
2004. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in
this Report to “we,” “us,” “our,”
“the company,” or “United Dominion” refer
collectively to United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. and its
subsidiaries.



At December 31, 2003, our portfolio included
264 communities with 76,244 apartment homes nationwide. The
following table summarizes our market information by major
geographic markets (includes real estate held for disposition,
real estate under development and land, but excludes commercial
properties):

Liquidity and Capital
    Resources

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and
future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity
of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds
through capital management. Both the coordination of asset and
liability maturities and effective capital management are
important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of
liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by
rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to
our portfolio of apartment homes. We



routinely use our unsecured bank credit facility
to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities
prior to arranging for longer-term financing. During the past
several years, proceeds from the sale of real estate have been
used for both investing and financing activities.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity
requirements generally through net cash provided by operations
and borrowings under credit arrangements. We expect to meet
certain long-term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt
maturities, the repayment of financing on development activities
and potential property acquisitions, through long-term secured
and unsecured borrowings, the disposition of properties and the
issuance of additional debt or equity securities. We believe
that our net cash provided by operations will continue to be
adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of
dividends by the company in accordance with REIT requirements in
both the short- and long-term. Likewise, the budgeted
expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain
properties are expected to be funded from property operations.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission that provides for the
issuance of up to an aggregate of $1 billion in common
shares, preferred shares and debt securities to facilitate
future financing activities in the public capital markets.
Throughout 2003, we completed various financing activities under
our $1 billion shelf registration statement. These
activities are summarized in the section titled “Financing
Activities” that follows. As of December 31, 2003,
approximately $506.3 million of equity and debt securities
remained available for use under the shelf registration
statement. Access to capital markets is dependent on market
conditions at the time of issuance. In January 2004, we sold
$75 million of 5.13% senior unsecured notes due
January 2014 under our $1 billion shelf registration
statement. The net proceeds of $73.9 million from the
issuance were used to repay secured and unsecured debt
obligations maturing in the first quarter of 2004.

In July 2003, we entered into a sales agreement
pursuant to which we may issue and sell through an agent up to a
total of five million shares of common stock from time to time
in “at the market offerings,” as defined in
Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933. These sales will be
made under our $1 billion shelf registration statement. The
sales price of the common stock will be no lower than the
minimum price designated by us prior to the sale. As of
December 31, 2003, we had not sold any shares of common
stock pursuant to the sales agreement.

In June 2003, Moody’s Investors Service
upgraded our rating outlook to Positive from Stable with senior
unsecured debt rated at Baa3 and preferred stock rated at Ba1.
In September 2003, Standard & Poor’s Rating
Services upgraded the rating on our senior unsecured debt to
BBB, our preferred stock to BBB-, and our corporate credit
rating to BBB/ Stable outlook.

In November 2003, we increased our medium-term
note program from $300 million to $500 million.

Future Capital Needs

Future development expenditures are expected to
be funded primarily through joint ventures, with proceeds from
the sale of property, with construction loans and, to a lesser
extent, with cash flows provided by operating activities.
Acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be
largely financed through the issuance of equity and debt
securities, the issuance of operating partnership units, the
assumption or placement of secured and/or unsecured debt and by
the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of property in
non-strategic markets.

During 2004, we have approximately
$46.8 million of secured debt and $101.1 million of
unsecured debt maturing, and we anticipate repaying that debt
with proceeds from borrowings under our secured or unsecured
credit facilities or the issuance of new unsecured debt
securities or equity.

Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates

Our critical accounting policies are those having
the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and
results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates.
These policies include those related to (1) capital
expenditures, (2) impairment of long-lived assets,
(3) derivatives and hedging



activities and (4) real estate investment
properties. With respect to these critical accounting policies,
we believe that the application of judgments and assessments is
consistently applied and produces financial information that
fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods
presented.

Capital Expenditures

In conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, we capitalize those
expenditures related to acquiring new assets, materially
enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially
extending the useful life of an existing asset. Expenditures
necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating
condition are expensed as incurred.

During 2003, $53.1 million or $714 per
home was spent on capital expenditures for all of our
communities, excluding development and commercial properties.
These capital improvements included turnover related
expenditures for floor coverings and appliances, other recurring
capital expenditures such as HVAC equipment, roofs, siding,
parking lots and other non-revenue enhancing capital
expenditures, which aggregated $34.5 million or
$464 per home. In addition, revenue enhancing capital
expenditures, including water sub-metering, the initial
installation of microwaves or washer-dryers and extensive
interior upgrades totaled $15.4 million or $207 per
home and major renovations totaled $3.2 million or
$43 per home for the year ended December 31, 2003.

The following table outlines capital expenditures
and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities,
excluding real estate under development and commercial
properties for the periods presented:

Total capital improvements increased
$10.3 million or $151 per home in 2003 compared to
2002. We will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing
improvements which we believe will provide a return on
investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital.
Recurring capital expenditures during 2004 are currently
expected to be approximately $470 per home.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets
used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that
the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by the future operation and
disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of
those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical
results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market
and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. The
net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market
value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our best
estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market
rates and transactions.

We review the carrying value of our portfolio of
assets on a regular basis. During 2002, we pursued our strategy
of exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited.
As a result, 25 apartment communities were placed under contract
and two of these assets were ultimately sold at net selling
prices



below their net book values. Accordingly, we
recorded an aggregate $2.3 million impairment loss for the
write down of a portfolio of apartment communities in Memphis,
Tennessee. In 2001, in connection with our analysis of the
carrying value of all undeveloped land parcels, we recognized an
aggregate $2.8 million impairment loss on seven undeveloped
sites in selected markets. An impairment loss was indicated as a
result of the net book value of the assets being greater than
the estimated fair market value less the cost of disposal.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

We use derivative financial instruments in the
normal course of business to reduce our exposure to fluctuations
in interest rates. As of December 31, 2003, we had five
interest rate swap agreements with a notional value aggregating
$68.5 million that are used to fix the interest rate on a
portion of our variable rate debt. These derivatives qualify for
hedge accounting as discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated
financial statements. While we intend to continue to meet the
conditions for hedge accounting, if a particular interest rate
swap does not qualify as highly effective, any change in the
fair value of the derivative used as a hedge would be reflected
in current earnings. Furthermore, should any change in
management strategy, or any other circumstance, cause an
existing highly effective hedge to become ineffective, the
accumulated loss or gain in the value of the derivative
instrument since its inception may be required to be immediately
reclassified from the stockholders’ equity section of the
balance sheet to the income statement.

Interest rate swaps, where we effectively make
fixed rate payments and receive variable rate payments to
eliminate our variable rate exposure, are entered into to manage
the interest rate risk in our existing balance sheet mix. These
instruments are valued using the market standard methodology of
netting the discounted future variable cash receipts and the
discounted expected fixed cash payments. The variable cash flow
streams are based on an expectation of future interest rates
derived from observed market interest rate curves. We have not
changed our methods of calculating these fair values or
developing the underlying assumptions. The values of these
derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments
are made and as market conditions change. Any event that impacts
the level of actual and expected future interest rates will
impact our swap valuations. The fair value of our existing swap
portfolio is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on
changing levels of interest rates and shortening swap terms to
maturity. Information about the fair values, notional amounts
and contractual terms of our interest rate swaps can be found in
Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements and the
section titled “Interest Rate Risk” that follows.

Potential losses are limited to counterparty risk
in situations where we are owed money; that is, when we hold
contracts with positive fair values. We do not expect any losses
from counterparties failing to meet their obligations as the
counterparties are highly rated credit quality
U.S. financial institutions and we believe that the
likelihood of realizing material losses from counterparty
non-performance is remote. At December 31, 2003, we had
unrealized losses totaling $1.6 million on derivative
transactions, which if terminated, would require a cash outlay.
We presently have no intention to terminate these contracts.
There are no credit concerns related to our obligations and we
expect to meet those obligations without default.

Real Estate Investment Properties

We purchase real estate investment properties
from time to time and allocate the purchase price to various
components, such as land, buildings and intangibles related to
in-place leases and customer relationships in accordance with
FASB Statement No. 141,

“Business
Combinations.

” The purchase price is allocated based on
the relative fair value of each component. The fair value of
buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon
acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates. As
such, the determination of fair value considers the present
value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the
property including an initial lease up period. We determine the
fair value of in-place leases by assessing the net effective
rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms
for similar leases at acquisition. The fair value of in-place
leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the



remaining contractual lease period. We determine
the fair value of in-place leases by considering the cost of
acquiring similar leases, the foregoing rents associated with
the lease-up period and the carrying costs associated with the
lease-up period.

The following discussion explains the changes in
net cash provided by operating and financing activities and net
cash used in investing activities that are presented in our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2003, our
cash flow provided by operating activities was
$234.9 million compared to $229.0 million for 2002.
During 2003, the increase in cash flow from operating activities
resulted primarily from a $15.8 million decrease in
interest expense and an overall increase in operating
liabilities primarily due to increased trade payables and an
increase in unsecured interest payables as a result of different
payment terms on new financings. These increases in cash flow
were partially offset by a $15.5 million decrease in
property operating income resulting from the overall decrease in
our apartment community portfolio (see discussion under
“Apartment Community Operations”) and a reduced level
of collections on escrows due to lower refinancing activities.

Investing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2003, net
cash used in investing activities was $304.2 million
compared to $67.4 million for 2002. Changes in the level of
investing activities from period to period reflects our strategy
as it relates to our acquisition, capital expenditure,
development and disposition programs, as well as the impact of
the capital market environment on these activities, all of which
are discussed in further detail below.

Acquisitions

For the year ended December 31, 2003, we
acquired 3,514 apartment homes in 11 communities for an
aggregate consideration of $347.7 million and one parcel of
land for $3.1 million. In addition, we purchased the
remaining 47% joint venture partners’ ownership interest in
nine communities with 1,706 apartment homes in Salinas and
Pacific Grove, California, for $76.0 million in June 2003.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we
acquired nine communities with 3,041 apartment homes and one
parcel of land for approximately $267 million. In addition,
in June 2002, we purchased, for approximately $52 million,
the remaining two apartment communities with 644 apartment homes
that were part of an unconsolidated development joint venture in
which we owned a 25% interest and served as the managing
partner. In August 2002, we purchased the outside partnership
interest in two properties in California containing 926
apartment homes for approximately $17 million.

Consistent with our long-term strategic plan to
achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer,
more concentrated markets, over the last two years, we have been
expanding our interests in the fast growing Southern California
market. During 2004, we plan to continue to channel new
investments into those markets we believe will provide the best
investment returns for us over the next ten years. Markets will
be targeted based upon defined criteria including past
performance, expected job growth, current and anticipated
housing supply and demand and the ability to attract and support
household formation.

Real Estate Under Development

Development activity is focused in core markets
in which we have operations. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, we invested approximately
$13.6 million in development projects, down
$9.2 million from our 2002 level of $22.8 million.



The following projects were under development as
of December 31, 2003:

In addition, we own six parcels of land that we
continue to hold for future development that had a carrying
value as of December 31, 2003 of $7.8 million. Five of
the six parcels represent additional phases to existing
communities as we plan to add apartment homes adjacent to
currently owned communities that are in improving markets.

In December 2003, The Mandolin II, a
178-apartment home community located in Dallas, Texas, was
completed. Total development costs for the project as of
December 31, 2003, were $12.2 million or
$68,500 per home. The community was 65.2% leased at
December 31, 2003.

Development Joint Venture

In September 2002, we entered into a development
joint venture with AEGON USA Realty Advisors, Inc. in which
we serve as the managing member. The joint venture is expected
to develop approximately eight to ten garden-style apartment
communities over the next three to five years, with a total
development cost of up to $210 million. The joint venture
will obtain bank construction financing for 65% to 80% of total
costs and will provide equity contributions for the balance of
the costs with AEGON providing 80% and us providing 20%. We are
serving as the developer, general contractor and property
manager for the joint venture, and have guaranteed those project
development costs, excluding financing costs (including fees and
interest), which exceed the defined project cost budgeted
amounts for each respective project, as they come to fruition.
We believe that the likelihood of funding guarantor obligations
is remote and that the impact to us would be immaterial. In June
2003, we contributed land with a carrying value of
$3.8 million to the joint venture.

As of December 31, 2003, Villa Toscana, a
504-apartment home community located in Houston, Texas, was
under development and total costs incurred as of
December 31, 2003, were $10.8 million. Budgeted costs
for the project are estimated to be approximately
$28.4 million or $56,300 per apartment home. The
project is anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of
2005.

Disposition of Investments

For the year ended December 31, 2003, we
sold seven communities with 1,927 apartment homes for an
aggregate consideration of $88.9 million, one parcel of
land for $1.3 million and two commercial properties for an
aggregate consideration of $7.3 million. We recognized
gains for financial reporting purposes of $15.9 million on
these sales. Proceeds from the sales were used primarily to
reduce debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, we
sold 25 communities with a total of 6,990 apartment homes, one
commercial property and one parcel of land for an aggregate
sales price of approximately $319 million and recognized
gains for financial reporting purposes of $31.5 million.
Proceeds from the sales were applied primarily to acquire
communities and reduce debt. In addition, during the first
quarter of 2002, $3.1 million in proceeds were received on
the condemnation of 96 units of a community in Fresno,
California that resulted in a gain of $1.2 million.

During 2004, we plan to continue to pursue our
strategy of exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are
limited and redeploying capital into markets that would enhance
future growth rates and economies of scale. We intend to use
proceeds from 2004 dispositions to acquire communities, fund
development activity and reduce debt.



Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities during
2003 was $70.9 million compared to net cash used in
financing activities in 2002 of $163.1 million. As part of
the plan to improve our balance sheet, we utilized proceeds from
dispositions, equity and debt offerings and refinancings to
extend maturities, pay down existing debt and purchase new
properties.

The following is a summary of our financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2003:



•

Sold $75 million aggregate principal amount
    of 5.13% senior unsecured notes due January 2014 in October
    2003 under our medium-term note program. The net proceeds of
    $74.5 million were used to repay amounts outstanding on our
    $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility.

•

Sold $50 million aggregate principal amount
    of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due January 2009 in
    November 2003 under our medium-term note program. The net
    proceeds of $49.8 million were used to fund acquisitions of
    apartment communities.

•

Exercised our right to redeem 4.0 million
    shares of our Series D Cumulative Convertible Redeemable
    Preferred Stock in December 2003. Upon receipt of our redemption
    notice, the shares to be redeemed were converted by the holder
    into 6,154,000 shares of common stock at a price of
    $16.25 per share.

Credit Facilities

We have four secured revolving credit facilities
with Fannie Mae with an aggregate commitment of
$860 million and one with Freddie Mac for $72 million.
As of December 31, 2003, $676.3 million was
outstanding under the Fannie Mae credit facilities leaving
$183.7 million of unused capacity. The Fannie Mae credit
facilities are for an initial term of ten years, bear interest
at floating and fixed rates and can be extended for an
additional five years at our discretion. As of December 31,
2003, $70.7 million had been funded under the Freddie Mac
credit facility leaving $1.3 million of unused capacity.
The Freddie Mac credit facility is for an initial term of five
years with an option for us to extend for an additional
four-year term at the then market rate. As of December 31,
2003, aggregate borrowings under both the Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac credit facilities were $747 million. We have
$305.9 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted
average interest rate of 6.4%. The remaining balance on these
facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of
1.7%.

We have a $500 million three-year unsecured
revolving credit facility that matures in March 2006. The credit
facility replaces our $375 million unsecured revolver and
$100 million unsecured term loan. If we receive commitments
from additional lenders or if the initial lenders increase their
commitments, we will be able to increase the credit facility to
$650 million. At our option, the credit facility can be
extended one year to March 2007. Based on our current credit
ratings, the credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to
LIBOR plus 90 basis points. As of December 31, 2003,
$137.9 million was outstanding under the credit facility,
leaving $362.1 million of unused capacity.

The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit facilities
and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary
financial covenants and limitations.

Derivative Instruments

As part of our overall interest rate risk
management strategy, we use derivatives as a means to fix the
interest rates of variable rate debt obligations or to hedge
anticipated financing transactions. Our derivative transactions
used for interest rate risk management include various interest
rate swaps with indices that relate to the pricing of specific
financial instruments of the company. We believe that we have
appropriately controlled our interest rate risk through the use
of derivative instruments. During 2003, the fair value of our
derivative instruments has improved from an unfavorable
$9.6 million at December 31, 2002, to an unfavorable
$1.6 million at December 31, 2003. This decrease is
primarily due to the maturity and settlement of eight swaps in
2003 and the normal progression of the fair market value of
derivative instruments towards zero as they approach expiration.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated
with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to
be refinanced. We do not hold financial instruments for trading
or other speculative purposes, but rather, issue these financial
instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets.
Interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in
market interest rates and the fair value of market rate



sensitive assets and liabilities. Our earnings
are affected as changes in short-term interest rates impact our
cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt. A large
portion of our market risk is exposure to short-term interest
rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under the
unhedged portion of our Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit
facilities and our bank revolving credit facility, which totaled
$441.2 million and $86.4 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2003. The impact on our financial statements
of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2003 was
immaterial.

At December 31, 2003, the notional value of
our derivative products for the purpose of managing interest
rate risk was $68.5 million, representing interest rate
swaps under which we pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a
variable rate. These agreements effectively fix
$68.5 million of our variable rate notes payable to a
weighted average fixed rate of 8.1%. At December 31, 2003,
the fair market value of the interest rate swaps was an
unfavorable $1.6 million. If interest rates were
100 basis points more or less at December 31, 2003,
the fair market value of the interest rate swaps would have
increased or decreased approximately $0.3 million.

If market interest rates for variable rate debt
average 100 basis points more in 2004 than they did
during 2003, our interest expense, after considering the effects
of our interest rate swap agreements, would increase, and income
before taxes would decrease by $5.8 million. Comparatively,
if market interest rates for variable rate debt had averaged
100 basis points more in 2003 than in 2002, our interest
expense, after considering the effects of our interest rate swap
agreements, would have increased, and income before taxes would
have decreased by $5.3 million. If market rates for fixed
rate debt were 100 basis points higher at December 31,
2003, the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased
from $1.57 billion to $1.46 billion. If market
interest rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points
lower at December 31, 2003, the fair value of fixed rate
debt would have increased from $1.57 billion to
$1.58 billion.

These amounts are determined by considering the
impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and
interest rate swap agreements. These analyses do not consider
the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity
that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event
of a change of such magnitude, we would likely take actions to
further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the
uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and
their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no
change in our financial structure.

Funds from Operations

Funds from operations (“FFO”) is
defined as net income (computed in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses)
from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate
depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute FFO
for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations
set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trust’s (“NAREIT”) April 1, 2002 White
Paper. Adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) is
defined as FFO less recurring capital expenditures for our
stabilized portfolio of $464 per home in 2003 and
$425 per home in 2002. We consider FFO and AFFO in
evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance,
and believe that FFO and AFFO should be considered along with,
but not as an alternative to, net income as a measure of our
operating performance and liquidity. FFO does not represent cash
generated from operating activities in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative
of cash available to fund cash needs.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets
diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values
instead have historically risen or fallen with market
conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered
the presentation of operating results for real estate companies
that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by
themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure
of REIT operating performance that excludes historical costs
depreciation, among other items, from net income based on
generally accepted accounting principles. The use of FFO,
combined with the required presentations, has been fundamentally
beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results



of REITs among the investing public and making
comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. We
generally consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our
comparative operating and financial performance (although FFO
should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains
the primary measure of performance) because by excluding gains
or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating
real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation
and amortization, FFO can help one compare the operating
performance of a company’s real estate between periods or
as compared to different companies. We believe that FFO and AFFO
are the best measures of economic profitability for real estate
investment trusts.

The following table outlines our FFO calculation
and reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles
for the three years ended December 31, 2003

(dollars in
thousands)

:

In the computation of diluted FFO, OP Units,
out-performance partnership shares and the shares of
Series D Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock
and Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are
dilutive; therefore, they are included in the diluted share
count. In 2003, distributions to preferred stockholders exclude
$19.3 million related to a premium on preferred shares
repurchased.

Gains on the disposition of real estate
investments developed for sale is defined as net sales proceeds
less a tax provision (such development by REITs must be
conducted in a taxable REIT subsidiary) and the gross investment
basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation. We consider
FFO with gains (or losses) on real estate developed for sale to
be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because of
the short-term use of funds to produce a profit that differs
from the traditional long-term investment in real estate for
REITs.

on the disposition of real estate developed for sale to gross

:

FFO also does not represent cash generated from
operating activities in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and therefore should not be considered an
alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as
determined by generally accepted accounting principles, as a
measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily
indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs. A
presentation of cash flow metrics based on generally accepted
accounting principles is as follows (

Results of Operations

The following discussion includes the results of
both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods
presented.

Net Income Available to Common
    Stockholders

2003-vs-2002

Net income available to common stockholders was
$24.8 million ($0.21 per diluted share) for the year
ended December 31, 2003, compared to $25.8 million
($0.24 per diluted share) for the year ended
December 31, 2002, representing a decrease of
$1.0 million ($0.03 per diluted share). The decrease
in net income available to common stockholders for the year
ended December 31, 2003, when compared to the same period
in the prior year resulted primarily from the following items,
all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within
this Report:

These decreases in income were offset by a
$15.8 million decrease in interest expense in 2003,
$37.0 million less in prepayment penalties and premiums
paid in 2003 for the refinancing of mortgage debt and the
repurchase of unsecured debt, and a $2.3 million impairment
charge taken in 2002 related to a portfolio of properties in
Memphis, Tennessee.

2002-vs-2001

Net income available to common stockholders was
$25.8 million ($0.24 per diluted share) for the year
ended December 31, 2002, compared to $27.1 million
($0.27 per diluted share) for the prior year. The decrease
in net income available to common stockholders resulted
primarily from charges for prepayment penalties and premiums
paid in 2002 in connection with the refinancing of mortgage debt
and



the repurchase of unsecured debt, aggregating
$37.0 million before minority interests. These charges were
partially offset by the following items, all of which are
discussed in further detail elsewhere within this Report:

Apartment Community
    Operations

Our net income is primarily generated from the
operation of our apartment communities. The following table
summarizes the operating performance of our total apartment
portfolio for each of the periods presented (

dollars in
thousands

):

*

Excludes depreciation, amortization, and property
    management expenses.

**

Based upon weighted average stabilized units.

The decrease in total property operating income
since December 31, 2002 is primarily due to an overall
decrease in same community property operating income.

2003-vs-2002

Same Communities

Our same communities (those communities acquired,
developed and stabilized prior to January 1, 2002 and held
on December 31, 2003, which consisted of 67,814 apartment
homes) provided 89% of our property operating income for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

For 2003, same community property operating
income decreased 4.2% or $14.9 million compared to 2002.
The overall decrease in property operating income was primarily
attributable to a 1.8% or $9.9 million decrease in revenues
from rental and other income and a 2.5% or $5.0 million
increase in operating expenses. The decrease in revenues from
rental and other income was primarily driven by a 2.2% or
$12.8 million decrease in rental rates. This decrease in
income was partially offset by an 11.7% or $1.7 million
increase in sub-meter, gas, trash and utility reimbursements, a
5.5% or $1.0 million decrease in concession expense and a
1.7% or $0.7 million decrease in vacancy loss. Physical
occupancy remained constant at 93.2% for both 2003 and 2002.

The increase in property operating expenses was
primarily driven by a 17.6% or $1.7 million increase in
insurance costs, a 4.3% or $1.4 million increase in
utilities expense, a 2.4% or $0.9 million increase in
repair and maintenance costs, a 3.9% or $0.8 million
increase in administrative and marketing costs, a 0.7% or
$0.4 million increase in personnel costs, and a 0.8% or
$0.4 million increase in taxes, all of which were partially
offset by a 17.6% or $0.2 million decrease in incentive
compensation.



As a result of the percentage changes in property
rental income and property operating expenses, the operating
margin (property operating income divided by property rental
income) decreased 1.6% to 61.7%.

Non-Mature Communities

The remaining 11% of our property operating
income during 2003 was generated from communities that we
classify as “non-mature communities” (primarily those
communities acquired or developed during 2002 and 2003, sold
properties, and those properties classified as real estate held
for disposition). The 21 communities with
6,935 apartment homes that we acquired during 2002 and 2003
provided $30.6 million of property operating income. The
seven communities with 1,927 apartment homes sold during
2003 provided $4.6 million of property operating income. In
addition, our development communities, which included
972 apartment homes constructed since January 1, 2002,
provided $4.8 million of property operating income during
2003, the one community with 100 apartment homes classified
as real estate held for disposition provided $0.7 million
of property operating income and other non-mature communities
provided $1.7 million of property operating income for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

2002-vs-2001

Same Communities

Our same communities (those communities acquired,
developed, and stabilized prior to January 1, 2001 and held
on December 31, 2002, which consisted of
66,416 apartment homes) provided 87% of our property
operating income for the year ended December 31, 2002.

In 2002, same community property operating income
decreased 0.8% or $2.8 million compared to the prior year.
The overall decrease in property operating income was primarily
driven by a 17.1% or $5.6 million increase in vacancy loss
and a 37.1% or $4.5 million increase in concessions. These
decreases in income were partially offset by a 32.8% or
$3.4 million increase in sub-meter, trash and vacant
utility reimbursements, a 0.3% or $1.7 million increase in
rental rates and a 13.0% or $2.6 million increase in other
income. Physical occupancy declined 0.8% to 93.3% in 2002
compared to 2001.

For 2002, property operating expenses at these
same communities increased 0.9% or $1.7 million compared to
2001. This increase in property operating expenses was primarily
driven by a 10.6% or $3.3 million increase in repair and
maintenance costs and a 3.4% or $1.6 million increase in
real estate taxes, both of which were partially offset by a 5.1%
or $1.7 million decrease in utilities expense, a 40.2% or
$0.9 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and
a 9.5% or $1.0 million decrease in insurance costs.

As a result of the percentage changes in property
rental income and property operating expenses, the operating
margin decreased 0.4% to 63.3%.

Non-Mature Communities

The remaining 13% of our property operating
income during 2002 was generated from our non-mature communities
(primarily those communities acquired or developed during 2001
and 2002, sold properties, and those properties classified as
real estate held for disposition). The 16 communities with
4,989 apartment homes that we acquired during 2001 and 2002
provided $19.6 million of property operating income. In
addition, our development communities, which included 1,238
apartment homes constructed since January 1, 2001, provided
$6.7 million of property operating income during 2002. The
25 communities with 6,990 apartment homes sold during
2002 provided $18.1 million of property operating income,
the two communities with 363 apartment homes classified as
real estate held for disposition provided $1.9 million of
property operating income, and other non-mature communities
provided $4.6 million of property operating income for the
year ended December 31, 2002.



Real Estate Depreciation and
    Amortization

For the year ended December 31, 2003, real
estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and
discontinued operations increased $4.2 million or 2.7%
compared to the same period in 2002, regardless of the decrease
in the weighted average number of apartment homes experienced
from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The
increase was primarily due to the newly acquired properties
having a significantly higher per home cost compared to those
properties that have been disposed of, and other capital
expenditures.

During the year ended December 31, 2002,
real estate depreciation on both continuing and discontinued
operations increased $7.3 million or 4.8% compared to 2001.
The increase in depreciation expense was attributable to the
overall increase in the weighted average number of apartment
homes as well as the impact of completed development
communities, acquisitions and capital expenditures.

Interest Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2003,
interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations
decreased $15.8 million or 11.9% from 2002 primarily due to
debt refinancings, decreasing interest rates and an overall
decrease in the weighted average level of debt outstanding. For
the year ended December 31, 2003, the weighted average
amount of debt outstanding decreased 1.1% or $23.9 million
compared to the prior year and the weighted average interest
rate decreased from 6.1% to 5.4% during 2003. The weighted
average amount of debt outstanding during 2003 is lower than
2002 primarily due to the high acquisition volume at the
beginning of 2002 that was subsequently mitigated by high
disposition activity in the second half of 2002. Furthermore,
acquisition costs in 2003 that exceeded disposition proceeds
were funded, in most part, by equity and OP Unit issuances.
The decrease in the average interest rate during 2003 reflects
our ability to take advantage of declining interest rates
through refinancing and the utilization of variable rate debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations
decreased $11.4 million or 7.9% from 2001 primarily due to
debt refinancings and decreasing interest rates that were
partially offset by the overall increase in the weighted average
level of debt outstanding. For the year ended December 31,
2002, the weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased
2.0% or $40.4 million from 2001 levels and the weighted
average interest rate decreased from 7.1% to 6.1% for 2002. The
weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2002 is
higher than 2001 as we borrowed additional funds to acquire
apartment communities. The decrease in the average interest rate
during 2002 reflects our ability to take advantage of declining
interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of
variable rate debt.

General and Administrative

For the year ended December 31, 2003,
general and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million
or 6.6% over 2002 primarily due to an increase in incentive
compensation expense. Over the past two years, we have shifted
our long-term incentive reward system from stock options to
restricted stock, the cost of which is expensed quarterly during
the vesting period.

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
general and administrative expenses decreased $2.4 million
or 11.0% compared to 2001. The decrease was primarily due to
reduced personnel costs and state and local taxes that were
partially offset by increased third-party consulting expenses.

Impairment Loss on Real Estate and
    Investments

In 2003, we recognized a $1.4 million charge
for the write-off of our investment in Realeum, Inc., an
unconsolidated development joint venture created to develop
web-based solutions for multifamily property and portfolio
management.

In 2002, we pursued our strategy of exiting
markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and the
redeployment of capital would enhance future growth rates and
economies of scale. During 2002, we



sold 25 apartment communities with a total of
6,990 apartment homes, one commercial property and one parcel of
land with an aggregate net book value of approximately
$285 million. Although these sales resulted in an aggregate
net gain of $32.7 million, certain of these assets were
sold at net selling prices below their net book values. As a
result, we recorded an aggregate $2.3 million impairment
loss during 2002 for the write down of a portfolio of apartment
communities in Memphis, Tennessee.

Gains on Sales of Land and Depreciable
    Property

For the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of
$15.9 million and $32.7 million, respectively. Changes
in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect
the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to
period as well as the extent of gains related to specific
properties sold.

Premium on Preferred Share
    Repurchases

In the second quarter of 2003, we exercised our
right to redeem 2.0 million shares of our Series D
Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. Upon receipt
of our redemption notice, the shares to be redeemed were
converted by the holder into 3,076,923 shares of common
stock at a price of $16.25 per share. In December 2003, we
redeemed an additional 4.0 million shares of our
Series D. Upon receipt of our redemption notice, the shares
to be redeemed were converted by the holder into
6,154,000 shares of common stock at a price of
$16.25 per share. As a result, we recognized a
$19.3 million premium on preferred share repurchases during
2003. The premium amount recognized to convert these shares
represents the cumulative accretion to date between the
conversion value of the preferred stock and the value at which
it was recorded at the time of issuance.

Inflation

We believe that the direct effects of inflation
on our operations have been immaterial. Substantially all of our
leases are for a term of one year or less which generally
minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation.

Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual
obligations as of December 31, 2003 (

dollars in
thousands

):

During 2003, we incurred interest costs of
$119.0 million, of which $1.8 million was capitalized.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of December 31, 2003, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures
are designed with the objective of ensuring that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting them to material information required to be included in
our periodic SEC reports. In addition, our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that during
the year ended



December 31, 2003, there has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our
internal control over financial reporting is designed with the
objective of providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of our financial reporting and preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.

It should be noted that the design of any system
of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG
LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and
the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of United Dominion Realty
Trust, Inc. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 1, 3 and 8 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for gains and losses on the extinguishment
of debt in 2003, changed its method of accounting for the
disposal of long-lived assets in 2002, and changed its method of
accounting for derivative instruments in 2001.

DECEMBER 31, 2003

1.     SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and formation

United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland
corporation, was formed in 1972. United Dominion operates within
one defined business segment with activities related to the
ownership, management, development, acquisition, renovation and
disposition of multifamily apartment communities nationwide. At
December 31, 2003, United Dominion owned 264 communities
with 76,244 completed apartment homes and had three communities
with 807 apartment homes under development.

Basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of United Dominion and its
subsidiaries, including United Dominion Realty, L.P., (the
“Operating Partnership”), and Heritage Communities
L.P. (the “Heritage OP”), (collectively, “United
Dominion”). As of December 31, 2003, there were
130,386,163 units in the Operating Partnership outstanding, of
which 120,256,671 units or 92.2% were owned by United Dominion
and 10,129,492 units or 7.8% were owned by limited partners (of
which 1,853,204 are owned by the holders of the Series A
OPPS, See Note 11). As of December 31, 2003, there
were 3,518,857 units in the Heritage OP outstanding, of which
3,248,884 units or 92.3% were owned by United Dominion and
269,973 units or 7.7% were owned by limited partners. The
consolidated financial statements of United Dominion include the
minority interests of the unitholders in the Operating
Partnership and the Heritage OP. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Income taxes

United Dominion is operated as, and elects to be
taxed as, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”). Generally, a REIT complies with the
provisions of the Code if it meets certain requirements
concerning its income and assets, as well as if it distributes
at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and
will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes if it
distributes at least 100% of its income. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal income taxes. However,
United Dominion is subject to certain state and local excise or
franchise taxes, for which provision has been made.

The differences between net income available to
common stockholders for financial reporting purposes and taxable
income before dividend deductions relate primarily to temporary
differences, principally real estate depreciation and the tax
deferral of certain gains on property sales. The differences in
depreciation result from differences in the book and tax basis
of certain real estate assets and the differences in the methods
of depreciation and lives of the real estate assets. The
aggregate cost of our real estate assets for federal income tax
purposes was approximately $3.6 billion at
December 31, 2003.



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table reconciles United
Dominion’s net income to REIT taxable income for the three
years ended December 31, 2003

(dollars in thousands)

:

For income tax purposes, distributions paid to
common stockholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains
and return of capital, or a combination thereof. For the three
years ended December 31, 2003, distributions declared per
common share were taxable as follows:

Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to
amounts in prior years’ financial statements to conform
with current year presentation.

Real estate

Real estate assets held for investment are
carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any
recorded impairment losses.

Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance
costs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for
improvements, renovations and replacements related to the
acquisition and improvement of real estate assets are
capitalized at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful
lives if the value of the existing asset will be materially
enhanced or the life of the related asset will be substantially
extended beyond the original life expectancy.



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

United Dominion recognizes impairment losses on
long-lived assets used in operations when there is an event or
change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value
of an asset and the undiscounted future cash flows are not
sufficient to recover the asset’s carrying value. Our cash
flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to
reflect our best estimate of future market and operating
conditions and our estimated holding periods. If such indicators
of impairment are present, an impairment loss is recognized
based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its
fair value. Our estimates of fair market value represent our
best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market
rates and transactions.

For long-lived assets to be disposed of,
impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the
asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying
value of the asset. Properties classified as real estate held
for disposition generally represent properties that are under
contract for sale. Real estate held for disposition is carried
at the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair
value, less the cost to dispose, determined on an asset by asset
basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on
held for disposition properties are charged to expense as
incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations and
replacements related to held for disposition properties are
capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate
held for disposition.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which is
35 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major
improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures,
equipment and other assets. The value of acquired in-place
leases is amortized over the remaining term of each acquired
in-place lease.

All development projects and related carrying
costs are capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as “Real estate under development.” As each
building in a project is completed and becomes available for
lease-up, the total cost of the building is transferred to real
estate held for investment and the assets are depreciated over
their estimated useful lives. The cost of development projects
includes interest, real estate taxes, insurance and allocated
development overhead during the construction period.

Interest, real estate taxes and incremental labor
and support costs for personnel working directly on the
development site are capitalized as part of the real estate
under development to the extent that such charges do not cause
the carrying value of the asset to exceed its net realizable
value. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, total interest capitalized
was $1.8 million, $0.9 million and $2.9 million,
respectively.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash and
liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when
purchased.

Restricted cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held
by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance and replacement
reserves and security deposits.

Deferred financing costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and other
external costs incurred to obtain debt financings and are
generally amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates
the effective interest method, over a period not to exceed the
term of the related debt. Unamortized financing costs are
written-off when debt is retired before its maturity date.
During 2003, 2002 and 2001, amortization expense was
$4.7 million, $4.5 million and $3.6 million,
respectively.



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Investments in unconsolidated development
joint ventures

Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are
accounted for using the equity method when major business
decisions require approval by the other partners and United
Dominion does not have control of the assets. Investments are
recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in net
income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions. United
Dominion eliminates intercompany profits on sales of services
that are provided to joint ventures. Differences between the
carrying value of investments and the underlying equity in net
assets of the investee are due to capitalized interest on the
investment balance and capitalized development and leasing costs
that are recovered by United Dominion through fees during
construction.

Revenue recognition

United Dominion’s apartment homes are leased
under operating leases with terms generally of one year or less.
Rental income is recognized after it is earned and
collectability is reasonably assured.

Advertising costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred
and reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within
the line item “Administrative and marketing.” During
2003, 2002 and 2001, total advertising expense was $10.6
million, $11.0 million and $9.6 million, respectively.

Interest rate swap agreements

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133 and No. 138,

“Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

became
effective on January 1, 2001. The accounting standards
require companies to carry all derivative instruments, including
certain embedded derivatives, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated
and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type
of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that
are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company
must designate the hedging instrument, based on the exposure
being hedged, as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or
a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. For the
three years ended December 31, 2003, all of United
Dominion’s derivative financial instruments are interest
rate swap agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges of
debt with variable interest rate features and are qualifying
hedges for financial reporting purposes. For derivative
instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective
portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is
reported as a component of other comprehensive income and
reclassified into earnings during the same period or periods
during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The
remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of
the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows
of the hedged item, if any, is recognized in current earnings
during the period of change. The adoption of Statements
No. 133 and No. 138 on January 1, 2001 resulted
in a cumulative effect of an accounting change of a
$3.8 million loss, all of which was recorded directly to
other comprehensive income.

As part of United Dominion’s overall
interest rate risk management strategy, we use derivative
financial instruments as a means to artificially fix variable
rate debt or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. United
Dominion’s derivative transactions used for interest rate
risk management include various interest rate swaps with indices
that relate to the pricing of specific financial instruments of
United Dominion. Because of the close correlation between the
hedging instrument and the underlying cash flow exposure being
hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments
are generally offset by changes in the cash flow of the
underlying exposures. As a result, United Dominion believes that
it has appropriately controlled the risk so that derivatives
used for interest rate risk management will not have a



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

material unintended effect on consolidated
earnings. United Dominion does not enter into derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes.

The fair value of United Dominion’s
derivative instruments is reported on the balance sheet at their
current fair value. Estimated fair values for interest rate
swaps rely on prevailing market interest rates. These fair value
amounts should not be viewed in isolation, but rather in
relation to the values of the underlying hedged transactions and
investments and to the overall reduction in exposure to adverse
fluctuations in interest rates. Each interest rate swap
agreement is designated with all or a portion of the principal
balance and term of a specific debt obligation. The interest
rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments over the
life of the related agreements. Amounts received or paid on the
interest rate swaps are recorded on an accrual basis as an
adjustment to the related interest expense of the outstanding
debt based on the accrual method of accounting. The related
amounts payable to and receivable from counterparties are
included in other liabilities and other assets, respectively.

When the terms of an underlying transaction are
modified, or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist,
all changes in the fair value of the instrument are
marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income
each period until the instrument matures, unless the instrument
is redesignated as a hedge of another transaction. If a
derivative instrument is terminated or the hedging transaction
is no longer determined to be effective, amounts held in
accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into
earnings over the term of the future cash outflows on the
related debt.

Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all
changes in equity during each period except for those resulting
from investments by or distributions to stockholders, is
displayed in the accompanying Statements of Stockholders’
Equity. Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains
or losses from derivative financial instruments.

Stock-based compensation

United Dominion has elected to follow the
intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”

(“APB 25”) in accounting for its
employee stock options because the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under Statement No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”

requires the use of option valuation models that were not
developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB
25, because the exercise price of United Dominion’s
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant, no compensation cost has been
recognized.

Minority interests in operating
partnerships

Interests in operating partnerships held by
limited partners are represented by operating partnership units
(“OP Units”). The operating partnerships’ income
is allocated to holders of OP Units based upon net income
available to common stockholders and the weighted average number
of OP Units outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units
outstanding during the period. Capital contributions,
distributions and profits and losses are allocated to minority
interests in accordance with the terms of the individual
partnership agreements. OP Units can be exchanged for cash or
shares of United Dominion’s common stock on a one-for-one
basis, at the option of United Dominion. OP Units, as a
percentage of total OP Units and shares outstanding, was 6.4% at
December 31, 2003, 6.2% at December 31, 2002 and 6.8%
at December 31, 2001.

During 2003, we issued 1,617,815 Preferred
Operating Partnership Units (“Preferred OP Units”)
totaling $26.9 million as partial consideration for the
purchase of four communities. The Preferred OP

Units carry a fixed coupon of 8.0% until such
time as the common share dividend is equal to or exceeds this
amount for four consecutive quarters, at which time the
Preferred OP Units will be entitled to receive dividends
equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock.

Minority interests in other
partnerships

United Dominion has limited partners in certain
real estate partnerships acquired in certain merger
transactions. Net income for these partnerships is allocated
based upon the percentage interest owned by these limited
partners in each respective real estate partnership.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per common share is computed based
upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed
based upon common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive
stock options and other potentially dilutive common stock
equivalents. The dilutive effect of stock options and other
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents is determined
using the treasury stock method based on United Dominion’s
average stock price.

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted earning per share

(dollars in thousands,
except per share amounts):

The effect of the conversion of the operating
partnership units and convertible preferred stock is not
dilutive and is therefore not included as a dilutive security in
the earnings per share computation. The weighted average effect
of the conversion of the operating partnership units for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 9,690,883
shares, 8,577,918 shares and 7,281,835 shares, respectively. The
weighted average effect of the conversion of the convertible
preferred stock for the year ended December 31, 2003 was
11,636,293 shares and for the years ended December 31, 2002
and 2001, the weighted average effect was 12,307,692 shares.

Impact of recently issued accounting
standards

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement
No. 150,

“Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity”

(FAS 150). The statement establishes standards
for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial
instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This statement
is effective for all financial instruments created or modified
after May 31, 2003, and otherwise effective at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB decided to
indefinitely defer the



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

effective date of certain provisions of FAS 150
related to finite life entities and also indicated it may modify
other guidance in FAS 150. United Dominion believes that its
equity and its partner’s equity reported on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Minority interests,”
are properly classified.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities”

(FIN 46). This statement refines the
identification process of variable interest entities and how an
entity assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to
decide whether to consolidate that entity. United Dominion, from
time to time, enters into partnership and joint venture
arrangements, which may be required to be consolidated under
this statement. The provisions of Interpretation 46 were
deferred and are now applicable to joint ventures created before
February 1, 2003 for the first reporting period that ends
after December 15, 2003. United Dominion adopted FIN 46 as
of December 31, 2003, with no effect on its consolidated
financial statements.

On January 1, 2003, United Dominion adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145,

“Rescission of FASB Statement No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Correction”

(FAS 145). The provisions of FAS 145
related to the rescission of FAS No. 4 require United
Dominion to reclassify prior period items that do not meet the
extraordinary classification into continuing operations. During
the three years ended December 31, 2003, United Dominion
has incurred such expenses, and in compliance with FAS 145, has
reported those expenses as a component of continuing operations
for each period presented.

2.     REAL ESTATE
OWNED

United Dominion operates in 55 markets dispersed
throughout 19 states. At December 31, 2003, our largest
apartment market was Southern California, where we owned 7.0% of
our apartment homes, based upon carrying value. Excluding
Southern California, United Dominion did not own more than 6.5%
of its apartment homes in any one market, based upon carrying
value.

The following is a summary of real estate under
development by major category at December 31, 2003

(dollars in thousands):

United Dominion is pursuing its strategy of
exiting markets where long-term growth prospects are limited and
the redeployment of capital would enhance future growth rates
and economies of scale. During the first quarter of 2002, United
Dominion placed nine assets, with an aggregate net book value of
$89.3 million, under contract for sale and reclassified
them as real estate held for disposition. These sales closed in
the second quarter of 2002 and resulted in our withdrawal from
Naples, Florida; Tucson, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; and
substantially all of Memphis, Tennessee. Although these sales
resulted in an aggregate net gain of $11.5 million, certain
of these assets were sold at net selling prices below their net
book values at March 31, 2002. As a result, United Dominion
recorded an aggregate $2.3 million impairment loss in 2002
for the write down of a portfolio of five apartment communities
in Memphis, Tennessee.

During the first quarter of 2001, we performed an
analysis of the carrying value of all undeveloped land parcels
in connection with United Dominion’s plans to accelerate
the disposition of these sites. As a result, an aggregate
$2.8 million impairment loss was recognized on seven
undeveloped sites in selected markets. An impairment loss was
indicated as a result of the net book value of the assets being
greater than the estimated fair market value less the cost of
disposal.

3.     INCOME FROM
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

United Dominion adopted FASB Statement
No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets,”

(FAS 144) as of January 1,
2002. FAS 144 requires, among other things, that the primary
assets and liabilities and the results of operations of United
Dominion’s real properties which have been sold subsequent
to January 1, 2002, or are held for disposition subsequent
to January 1, 2002, be classified as discontinued
operations and segregated in United Dominion’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets. Properties
classified as real estate held for disposition generally
represent properties that are under contract for sale and are
expected to close within the next twelve months. For purposes of
these financial statements, FAS 144 results in the presentation
of the primary assets and liabilities and the net operating
results of those properties sold or classified as held for
disposition through December 31, 2003, as discontinued
operations for all periods presented. The adoption of FAS 144
does not have an impact on net income available to common
stockholders. FAS 144 only results in the reclassification of
the operating results of all properties sold or classified as
held for disposition through December 31, 2003 within the
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the reclassification
of the assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Balance
Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, United
Dominion sold seven communities with a total of 1,927 apartment
homes and two commercial properties. At December 31, 2003,
United Dominion had one community with 100 apartment homes and a
net book value of $10.9 million and one parcel of land with
a net book value of $3.8 million included in real estate
held for disposition. During 2002, United Dominion sold 25
communities with a total of 6,990 apartment homes, one parcel of
land and one commercial

properties and the interest expense associated with the secured

4.     INVESTMENT IN
UNCONSOLIDATED DEVELOPMENT JOINT VENTURES

AEGON Joint Venture

On September 10, 2002, United Dominion
entered into a development joint venture with AEGON USA Realty
Advisors, Inc. in which United Dominion is serving as the
managing member. The joint venture is expected to develop
approximately eight to ten garden-style apartment communities
over the next three years, with a total development cost of up
to $210 million. The joint venture will obtain bank
construction financing for 65% to 80% of total costs and will
provide equity contributions for the balance of the costs with
AEGON providing 80% and United Dominion providing 20%. United
Dominion is serving as the developer, general contractor and
property manager for the joint venture and has guaranteed those
project development costs, excluding financing costs (including
fees and interest), which exceed the defined project cost
budgeted amounts for each respective project, as they come to
fruition. We estimate that the likelihood of funding guarantor
obligations is remote and that the impact to United Dominion
would be immaterial. In June 2003, United Dominion contributed
land with a carrying value of $3.8 million to the joint
venture.

Realeum Joint Venture

During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recognized
a $2.2 million charge for the write down of United
Dominion’s investment in Realeum, Inc., an unconsolidated
joint venture created to develop web-based solutions for
multifamily property and portfolio management, after our
ownership in the joint venture was diluted. In the third quarter
of 2003, United Dominion recognized a $1.4 million charge
to write-off the remaining balance of this investment once it
was determined that we would not pursue this investment as a
replacement to our existing property management software.

5.     SECURED

Fixed Rate Debt

Mortgage notes
payable

Fixed rate mortgage notes
payable are generally due in monthly installments of principal
and interest and mature at various dates from January 2004
through June 2034 and carry interest rates ranging from 6.12% to
8.50%.

Tax-exempt secured notes
payable

Fixed rate mortgage notes
payable that secure tax-exempt housing bond issues mature at
various dates through November 2025 and carry interest rates
ranging from 6.09% to 6.75%. Interest on these notes is
generally payable in semi-annual installments.

Secured credit
facilities

At December 31, 2003,
United Dominion’s fixed rate secured credit facilities
consisted of $305.9 million of the $676.3 million
outstanding on an $860 million aggregate commitment under
four revolving secured credit facilities with Fannie Mae. The
Fannie Mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten
years, bear interest at floating and fixed rates and can be
extended for an additional five years at United Dominion’s
discretion. In order to limit a portion of its interest rate
exposure, United Dominion has two interest rate swap agreements
associated with the Fannie Mae credit facilities. These
agreements have an aggregate notional value of
$17.0 million under which United Dominion pays a fixed rate
of interest and receives a variable rate on the notional amount.
The interest rate swap agreements effectively change United
Dominion’s interest rate exposure on $17.0 million of
secured debt from a variable rate to a weighted average fixed
rate of 6.74%.

Variable Rate Debt

Mortgage notes
payable

Variable rate mortgage notes
payable are generally due in monthly installments of principal
and interest and mature at various dates from January 2005
through July 2013. As of December 31, 2003, these notes had
interest rates ranging from 2.01% to 3.99%.

Tax-exempt secured note
payable

The variable rate mortgage
note payable which secures tax-exempt housing bond issues
matures in July 2028. As of December 31, 2003, this note
had an interest rate of 1.08%. Interest on this note is payable
in semi-annual installments.

Secured credit
facilities

As of December 31,
2003, United Dominion’s variable rate secured credit
facilities consisted of $370.5 million outstanding on the
Fannie Mae credit facilities and $70.7 million outstanding
on the Freddie Mac credit facility. As of December 31,
2003, the variable rate Fannie Mae credit facilities had a
weighted average floating rate of interest of 1.73% and the
Freddie Mac credit facility had a weighted average floating rate
of interest of 1.55%.

of expenses as a result of prepayment penalties incurred from
the refinancing of certain secured loans, using proceeds from
the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit facilities and the early
payoff of loans on the sale of properties. These prepayment
penalties were funded by proceeds of the new credit facilities,
proceeds from the related asset sales and from the release of
cash escrows retained by former lenders of $14.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002.

During the first quarter of 2003, United Dominion
    closed on a new three-year $500 million unsecured revolving
    credit facility. The credit facility replaced United
    Dominion’s $375 million unsecured revolving credit
    facility and $100 million unsecured term loan. If United
    Dominion receives commitments from additional lenders or if the
    initial lenders increase their commitments, United Dominion will
    be able to increase the credit facility to $650 million. At
    United Dominion’s option, the credit facility can be
    extended for one year to March 2007.

    three interest rate swap agreements associated with commercial
    bank borrowings under the revolver with an aggregate notional
    value of $51.5 million under which United Dominion pays a
    fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate of interest
    on the notional amounts. The interest rate swaps, which mature
    from May 2004 through July 2004, effectively change United
    Dominion’s interest rate exposure on the $51.5 million
    of borrowings from a variable rate to a weighted average fixed
    rate of approximately 8.5%. As of December 31, 2003, 2002

    borrowings, after giving effect to swap agreements, was 4.2%,
    6.8% and 6.5%, respectively.

into any of our other securities. The
Series B is not redeemable prior to May 29, 2007. On
or after this date, the Series B may be redeemed for cash
at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of $25
per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The redemption
price is payable solely out of the sale proceeds of our other
capital stock. All dividends due and payable on the
Series B have been accrued or paid as of the end of each
fiscal year.

Distributions declared on the Series B in
2003 were $2.15 per share or $.5375 per quarter. The
Series B is listed on the NYSE under the symbol
“UDRpfb.”

The Series D Cumulative Convertible
Redeemable Preferred Stock has no stated par value and a
liquidation preference of $25 per share. The Series D has
no voting rights except as required by law. In addition, if
Series D dividends are in arrears for any dividend period,
the holders of the Series D have rights to notices and
voting entitlements of holders of common stock until all
accumulated dividends for all past dividend periods and the then
current dividend period have been paid or set aside for payment.
The Series D has no stated maturity, is not subject to any
sinking fund or mandatory redemption, and is convertible into
1.5385 shares of common stock, subject to certain adjustments,
at the option of the holder of the Series D at any time. We
may, at our option, redeem at any time all or part of the
Series D at a price per share of $25, payable in cash, plus
all accrued and unpaid dividends, provided that the current
market price of our common stock at least equals the conversion
price, initially set at $16.25 per share. The redemption is
payable solely out of the sale proceeds of other capital stock;
provided, however, that we may not redeem, in any consecutive
twelve-month period, a number of shares of Series D having
an aggregate liquidation preference of more than
$100 million, subject to certain exceptions.

In 2003, we exercised our right to redeem
6.0 million shares of our Series D. Upon receipt of
our redemption notice, the shares to be redeemed were converted
by the holder into 9,230,923 shares of common stock at a price
of $16.25 per share. As a result, we recognized
$19.3 million in premium on preferred shares repurchased
throughout 2003. The premium amount recognized to convert these
shares represents the cumulative accretion to date between the
conversion value of the preferred stock and the value at which
it was recorded at the time of issuance.

Distributions declared on the Series D in
2003 were $2.04 per share or $.5089 per quarter. The
Series D is not listed on any exchange.

The Series E Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock has no stated par value and a liquidation
preference of $16.61 per share. Subject to certain adjustments
and conditions, each share of the Series E is convertible
at any time and from time to time at the holder’s option
into one share of our common stock. The holders of the
Series E are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis as a
single class in combination with the holders of common stock at
any meeting of our stockholders for the election of directors or
for any other purpose on which the holders of common stock are
entitled to vote. The Series E has no stated maturity and
is not subject to any sinking fund or any mandatory redemption.

Distributions declared on the Series E in
2003 were $0.84 per share, $0.18 per share in the second quarter
and $0.33 per share in each of the third and fourth quarters.
The Series E is not listed on any exchange.

On June 15, 2001, United Dominion completed
the redemption of all of its outstanding 9.25% Series A
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25 per share plus
accrued dividends.

Officers’ Stock Purchase and Loan
Plan

As of December 31, 2003, United Dominion has
$0.5 million of notes receivable from certain officers and
directors of United Dominion at an interest rate of 7.0%. The
notes mature in June 2004. The purpose of the loans was for the
borrowers to purchase shares of United Dominion’s common
stock pursuant to



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

United Dominion’s 1991 Stock Purchase and
Loan Plan. The loans are evidenced by promissory notes between
the borrowers and United Dominion and are secured by a pledge of
the shares of common stock (33,000 shares with a market value of
$0.6 million at December 31, 2003). The notes require
that dividends received on the shares be applied towards payment
of the notes.

In addition, United Dominion entered into a
Servicing and Purchase Agreement (the “Servicing
Agreement”) with SunTrust Bank (the “Bank”)
whereby United Dominion has agreed to act as servicing agent for
and to purchase certain loans made by the Bank to officers and
directors of United Dominion (the “Borrowers”) to
finance the purchase of shares of United Dominion’s common
stock. The loans are evidenced by promissory notes
(“Notes”) between each Borrower and the Bank. The
Servicing Agreement provides that the Bank can require United
Dominion to purchase the Notes upon an event of default by the
Borrower or United Dominion under the Servicing Agreement and at
certain other times during the term of the Servicing Agreement.
The aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Notes as of
December 31, 2003 was $6.3 million (original principal
balance was $8.0 million), and all of the Notes mature
during 2004. Because certain of the Borrowers elected floating
rate loans and others elected fixed rate loans, the interest
rates on these loans as of December 31, 2003 range from
2.08% to 7.68%. Each Borrower entered into a Participation
Agreement with United Dominion that requires that all cash
dividends received on the shares (664,898 shares at
December 31, 2003 with a closing market value of
$12.8 million) be applied towards payment of the Notes.
Based upon the fact that 100% of all cash dividend payments are
paid to amortize the Notes and that the Notes are recourse to
the Borrowers, United Dominion believes that its exposure to
liability under the Servicing Agreement is remote.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan

United Dominion’s Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows
common and preferred stockholders the opportunity to purchase,
through the reinvestment of cash dividends, additional shares of
United Dominion’s common stock. As of December 31,
2003, 9,681,250 shares of common stock had been issued under the
Stock Purchase Plan. Shares in the amount of 4,318,750 were
reserved for further issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan as
of December 31, 2003. During 2003, 91,190 shares were
issued under the Stock Purchase Plan for a total consideration
of approximately $1.6 million.

Restricted Stock Awards

United Dominion’s 1999 Long-Term Incentive
Plan (“LTIP”) authorizes the grant of restricted stock
awards to employees, officers, consultants and directors of
United Dominion. Deferred compensation expense is recorded over
the vesting period and is based upon the value of the common
stock on the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2003,
540,659 shares of restricted stock have been issued under the
LTIP.

Shareholder Rights Plan

United Dominion’s 1998 Shareholder Rights
Plan is intended to protect long-term interests of stockholders
in the event of an unsolicited, coercive or unfair attempt to
take over United Dominion. The plan authorized a dividend of one
Preferred Share Purchase Right (the “Rights”) on each
share of common stock outstanding. Each Right, which is not
currently exercisable, will entitle the holder to purchase
1/1000 of a share of a new series of United Dominion’s
preferred stock, to be designated as Series C Junior
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, at a price to be
determined upon the occurrence of the event, and for which the
holder must be paid $45 should the takeover occur. Under the
Plan, the rights will be exercisable if a person or group
acquires more than 15% of United Dominion’s common

result in the ownership of 15% of United Dominion’s common

8.     FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The following estimated fair values of financial
instruments were determined by United Dominion using available
market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and
develop estimated fair value. Accordingly, the estimates
presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts
United Dominion would realize on the disposition of the
financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions
or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts. The carrying amounts and estimated
fair value of United Dominion’s financial instruments as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, are summarized as follows

(dollars in thousands)

:

The following methods and assumptions were used
by United Dominion in estimating the fair values set forth above.

Cash and cash equivalents

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents
approximates fair value.

Notes receivable

In August 2003, United Dominion received a
promissory note in the principal amount of $8 million which
is due September 2006. The note is secured by a second lien on a
property that United Dominion manages and has an option to
purchase. The note bears interest of 10.0% that is payable in
monthly installments. In June 2003, United Dominion received a
promissory note in the principal amount of $5 million which
is due October 2011. The note was received in connection with
one of our acquisitions and bears interest of 9.0% that is
payable in annual installments.

Secured and unsecured debt

Estimated fair value is based on mortgage rates,
tax-exempt bond rates and corporate unsecured debt rates
believed to be available to United Dominion for the issuance of
debt with similar terms and remaining lives. The carrying amount
of United Dominion’s variable rate secured debt
approximates fair value as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.
The carrying amounts of United Dominion’s borrowings under
variable rate unsecured debt arrangements, short-term revolving
credit agreements and lines of credit approximate their fair
values as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, United
Dominion recognized $8.1 million of unrealized gains in
comprehensive income and a $0.3 million realized gain in
net income related to the ineffective portion of United
Dominion’s hedging instruments. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, United Dominion recognized
$4.9 million of unrealized gains in comprehensive income
and a $0.05 million realized gain in net income related to
the ineffective portion of United Dominion’s hedging

Dominion recognized $11.0 million of unrealized losses in
comprehensive income, a $0.06 million realized loss in net
income related to the ineffective portion of United
Dominion’s hedging instruments, and a $3.8 million
loss as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

In addition, United Dominion has recognized
$1.6 million and $9.6 million, respectively, of
derivative financial instrument liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets within the line item “Accounts payable,
accrued expenses and other liabilities” for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002.

As of December 31, 2003, United Dominion
expects to reclassify $1.9 million of net losses on
derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive loss
to earnings (interest expense which, combined with the interest
paid on the underlying debt, results in interest expense at the
fixed rates shown above) during the next twelve months on the
related hedged transactions.

Risk of counterparty non-performance

United Dominion has not obtained collateral or
other security to support financial instruments. In the event of
non-performance by the counterparty, United Dominion’s
credit loss on its derivative instruments is limited to the
value of the derivative instruments that are favorable to United
Dominion at December 31, 2003, of which we have none.
However, such non-performance is not anticipated as the
counterparties are highly rated credit quality
U.S. financial institutions and we believe that the
likelihood of realizing material losses from counterparty
non-performance is remote.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Profit Sharing Plan

The United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.
Profit Sharing Plan (the “Plan”) is a defined
contribution plan covering all eligible full-time employees.
Under the Plan, United Dominion makes discretionary profit
sharing and matching contributions to the Plan as determined by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Aggregate
provisions for contributions, both matching and discretionary,
which are included in United Dominion’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the three years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $0.3 million,
$0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

Stock Option Plan

In May 2001, the stockholders of United Dominion
approved the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
“LTIP”), which supersedes the 1985 Stock Option Plan.
With the approval of the LTIP, no additional grants will be made
under the 1985 Stock Option Plan. The LTIP authorizes the
granting of awards which may take the form of options to
purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, dividend equivalents, other stock-based
awards, and any other right or interest relating to common stock
or cash. The Board of Directors reserved 4 million shares
for issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards under the
LTIP. The LTIP generally provides, among other things, that
options are granted at exercise prices not lower than the market
value of the shares on the date of grant and that options
granted must be exercised within ten years. The maximum number
of shares of stock that may be issued subject to incentive stock
options is 4 million shares. Shares under options that
expire or are cancelable are available for subsequent grant.

Pro forma information regarding net income and
earnings per share is required by FASB Statement No. 123

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”

(FAS 123), and has been determined as if United Dominion
had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair
value method of accounting as defined in FAS 123. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using
a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions for 2003, 2002 and 2001:

There were no options granted during 2003. The
weighted average fair value of options granted during 2002 and
2001 was $0.84 and $0.46 per option, respectively.

For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over
the options’ vesting period. United Dominion’s pro
forma information is as follows (

A summary of United Dominion’s stock option
activity during the three years ended December 31, 2003 is
provided in the following table:

The weighted average remaining contractual life
on all options outstanding is 5.5 years. A total of 628,150
of share options had exercise prices between $13.13 and $15.38,
909,296 of share options had exercise prices between $11.15 and
$12.23 and 998,741 of share options had exercise prices between
$9.63 and $10.88.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
stock-based awards for 3,028,920 and 3,149,350 shares of
common stock, respectively, were available for future grants
under the 1999 LTIP’s existing authorization.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

In 2001, we undertook a comprehensive review of
the organizational structure of United Dominion and its
operations subsequent to the appointment of a new senior
management team and CEO. As a result, we recorded
$4.5 million of expense related to the termination of
approximately 10% of United Dominion’s workforce in
operations and at the corporate headquarters. In addition,
United Dominion recognized expense in the aggregate of
$0.9 million related to relocation costs associated with
the new executive offices in Colorado and other miscellaneous
costs. These charges are included in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations within the line item “Severance costs and
other organizational charges.”

In addition, in 2001, we performed an analysis of
the carrying value of all undeveloped land parcels in connection
with United Dominion’s plans to accelerate the disposition
of these sites. As a result, an aggregate $2.8 million
impairment loss was recognized on seven undeveloped sites in
selected markets. An impairment loss was indicated as a result
of the net book value of the assets being greater than the
estimated fair market value less the cost of disposal. United
Dominion also recognized a $0.4 million charge for the
write down of its investment in an online apartment leasing
company.

Contingencies

Series A Out-Performance
    Program

In May 2001, the stockholders of United Dominion
approved the Series A Out-Performance Program (the
“Series A Program”) pursuant to which executives
and other key officers of United Dominion (the
“Participants”) were given the opportunity to invest
indirectly in United Dominion by purchasing interests in a
limited liability company (the “Series A LLC”),
the only asset of which is a special class of partnership units
of United Dominion Realty, L.P. (“Series A
Out-Performance Partnership Shares” or “Series A
OPPSs”), for an initial investment of $1.27 million
(the full market value of the Series A OPPSs, at inception,
as determined by an independent investment banking firm). The
Series A Program measured United Dominion’s
performance over a 28-month period beginning February 2001 and
ending on May 31, 2003.

The Series A Program was designed to provide
Participants with the possibility of substantial returns on
their investment if United Dominion’s total return on its
common stock, measured by the cumulative amount of dividends
paid plus share price appreciation during the measurement
period, exceeded the greater of (a) the cumulative total
return of the Morgan Stanley REIT Index over the same period;
and (b) is at least the equivalent of a 30% total return,
or 12% annualized.

At the conclusion of the measurement period on
May 31, 2003, United Dominion’s total return satisfied
these criteria. As a result, the Series A LLC as holder of
the Series A OPPSs will receive distributions and
allocations of income and loss from the Operating Partnership
equal to the distributions and allocations that would be
received on 1,853,204 interests in the Operating Partnership
(“OP Units”), which distributions and allocations
will be distributed to the participants on a pro rata basis
based on ownership of the Series A LLC.

Series B Out-Performance
    Program

In May 2003, the stockholders of United Dominion
approved the Series B Out-Performance Program (the
“Series B Program”) pursuant to which certain
executive officers of United Dominion (the
“participants”) were given the opportunity to invest
indirectly in United Dominion by purchasing interests in a
limited liability company (the “Series B LLC”),
the only asset of which is a special class of partnership units
of United Dominion Realty, L.P. (“Series B
Out-Performance Partnership Shares” or “Series B
OPPSs”) . The purchase price for the Series B OPPSs
was determined by United Dominion’s board of directors to
be $1 million, assuming 100% participation, and was based
upon the advice of an independent valuation expert. The
Series B Program will measure the cumulative total return
on our common stock over the 24-month period from June 1,
2003 to May 31, 2005.

The Series B Program is designed to provide
participants with the possibility of substantial returns on
their investment if the cumulative total return on United
Dominion’s common stock, as measured by the cumulative
amount of dividends paid plus share price appreciation during
the measurement period (a) exceeds the cumulative total
return of the Morgan Stanley REIT Index peer group index over
the same period; and (b) is at least the equivalent of a
22% total return or 11% annualized.

At the conclusion of the measurement period, if
United Dominion’s cumulative total return satisfies these
criteria, the Series B LLC as holder of the Series B
OPPSs will receive (for the indirect benefit of the participants
as holders of interests in the Series B LLC) distributions
and allocations of income and loss from the Operating
Partnership equal to the distributions and allocations that
would be received on the number of OP Units obtained by:

i. determining the amount by which the
    cumulative total return of United Dominion’s common stock
    over the measurement period exceeds the greater of the
    cumulative total return of the Morgan



UNITED DOMINION REALTY TRUST, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stanley REIT Index, which is the peer group
    index, or the minimum return (such excess being the “excess
    return”);

ii. multiplying 5% of the excess return by
    United Dominion’s market capitalization (defined as the
    average number of shares outstanding over the 24-month period,
    including common stock, OP Units, outstanding options and
    convertible securities) multiplied by the daily closing price of
    United Dominion’s common stock, up to a maximum of 2% of
    market capitalization; and

iii. dividing the number obtained in
    (ii) by the market value of one share of United
    Dominion’s common stock on the valuation date, determined
    by the weighted average price per day of common stock for the 20
    trading days immediately preceding the valuation date.

If, on the valuation date, the cumulative total
return of United Dominion’s common stock does not meet the
minimum return, then the participants will forfeit their entire
initial investment.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

United Dominion owns and operates multifamily
apartment communities throughout the United States that generate
rental and other property related income through the leasing of
apartment units to a diverse base of tenants. United Dominion
separately evaluates the performance of each of its apartment
communities. However, because each of the apartment communities
has similar economic characteristics, facilities, services and
tenants, the apartment communities have been aggregated into a
single apartment communities segment. All segment disclosure is
included in or can be derived from United Dominion’s
consolidated financial statements.

There are no tenants that contributed 10% or more
of United Dominion’s total revenues during 2003, 2002, or
2001.

EVENTS

On January 15, 2004, United Dominion
completed the sale of $75 million of 5.13% senior
unsecured notes due January 2014 under its $1 billion shelf
registration statement. These notes represent a re-opening of
the 5.13% senior notes due January 2014 issued by United
Dominion in October 2003, and these notes will constitute a
single series of notes, bringing the aggregate principal amount
outstanding of the 5.13% senior notes to $150 million.
The net proceeds of approximately $73.9 million from this
issuance were used to repay secured and unsecured debt
obligations maturing in the first quarter of 2004.
