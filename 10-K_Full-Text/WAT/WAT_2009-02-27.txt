INDEX



PART I

Item 1:

Business

General

Waters Corporation (“Waters” or the
    “Company”), an analytical instrument manufacturer,
    designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters
    Division, high performance liquid chromatography
    (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid
    chromatography

®

(“UPLC” and together with HPLC, herein referred to as
    “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”)
    instrument systems and support products, including
    chromatography columns, other consumable products and
    comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are
    complementary products that can be integrated together and used
    along with other analytical instruments. Through its TA Division
    (“TA”), the Company designs, manufactures, sells and
    services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry
    instruments. The Company is also a developer and supplier of
    software-based products that interface with the Company’s
    instruments as well as other manufacturers’ instruments.

The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, life
    science, biochemical, industrial, academic and government
    customers working in research and development, quality assurance
    and other laboratory applications. The Company’s (LC and
    MS) instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries
    to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical
    and biological composition of materials, as well as to purify a
    full range of compounds. These instruments are used in drug
    discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the
    analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as
    “proteomics”), food safety analysis and environmental
    testing. The Company’s thermal analysis, rheometry and
    calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability
    of fine chemicals and polymers for uses in various industrial,
    consumer goods and healthcare products.

Waters is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding
    common stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating
    subsidiary. Waters became a publicly traded company with its
    initial public offering (“IPO”) in November 1995.
    Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and
    complementary technologies to its range of products with the
    acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited
    (“Micromass”) in September 1997.

Business
    Segments

The Company’s business activities, for which discrete
    financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and
    evaluated by the chief operating decision makers. As a result of
    this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two
    operating segments: Waters Division and TA Division. As
    indicated above, the Company operates in the analytical
    instruments industry, designing, manufacturing, distributing and
    servicing products in three technologies: LC and MS instruments;
    columns and other consumables; and thermal analysis, rheometry
    and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating
    segments, Waters Division and TA Division, have similar economic
    characteristics; product processes; products and services; types
    and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory
    environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments
    have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial
    statement purposes.

Information concerning revenues and long-lived assets
    attributable to each of the Company’s products, services
    and geographic areas is set forth in Note 18 in the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated
    herein by reference.

WATERS
    DIVISION

High
    Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid
    Chromatography

Developed in the 1950’s, HPLC is the standard technique
    used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a
    variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes
    that HPLC’s performance capabilities enable it to separate
    and identify approximately 80% of all known chemicals and
    materials. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a
    wide variety of industries for research and development
    purposes, quality control and process engineering applications.



The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served
    by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these
    markets, HPLC is used extensively to identify new drugs, develop
    manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new
    pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other
    applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for
    nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations, the
    testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing
    industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as
    chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by
    universities, research institutions and government agencies,
    such as the United States Food and Drug Administration
    (“FDA”) and the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency (“EPA”) and their international counterparts
    that mandate testing that requires HPLC instrumentation.

Traditionally, a typical HPLC system has consisted of five basic
    components: solvent delivery system, sample injector, separation
    column, detector and data acquisition unit. The solvent delivery
    system pumps the solvent through the HPLC system, while the
    sample injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow. The
    chromatography column then separates the sample into its
    components for analysis by the detector, which measures the
    presence and amount of the constituents. The data acquisition
    unit, usually referred to as the instrument’s software or
    data system, then records and stores the information from the
    detector.

In 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company
    describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that
    utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter
    particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY
    UPLC

®

,

    to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic
    bands that are generated by these small particles. By using the
    ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more
    comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in
    comparison with many analyses performed by HPLC. In addition, in
    using ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the
    range of application beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to
    uncover new levels of scientific information. Though it offers
    significant performance advantages, ACQUITY UPLC is compatible
    with the Company’s software products and the general
    operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the
    Company’s customers and field sales and support
    organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology
    and instrument. The Company began shipping the ACQUITY UPLC in
    the third quarter of 2004. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company experienced growth in the LC instrument systems product
    line primarily from the sales of the ACQUITY UPLC.

Waters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in
    configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation,
    from component configured systems for academic research
    applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing,
    and that have a variety of detection technologies, from
    ultra-violet (“UV”) absorbance to MS, optimized for
    certain analyses. The Company also manufactures tailored LC
    systems for the analysis of biologics, as well as an LC detector
    utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the
    usage of LC to compounds that are not amenable to UV absorbance
    detection.

The primary consumable products for LC are chromatography
    columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in
    the LC testing process and are replaced at regular intervals.
    The chromatography column contains one of several types of
    packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from
    silica. As the sample flows through the column, it is separated
    into its constituent components.

Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and
    competitors’ LC systems. The Company believes that it is
    one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica,
    packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the
    Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key
    attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and
    react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company believes
    that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used nearly
    exclusively on its ACQUITY UPLC instrument and, furthermore,
    that its ACQUITY UPLC instrument will primarily use ACQUITY UPLC
    columns. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, excluding the small impact from
    acquisitions mentioned below, the Company experienced growth in
    its LC chromatography column and sample preparation businesses,
    especially in ACQUITY UPLC columns.

In December 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of
    Analytical Products Group, Inc. (“APG”), a provider of
    environmental testing products for quality control and
    proficiency testing used in environmental laboratories, for
    $5 million in cash. The APG business has been integrated
    into the Company’s Environmental Resources Associates, Inc.
    (“ERA”) business, which was acquired in December 2006.
    The Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
    ERA, a provider of environmental testing products for quality
    control, proficiency testing and specialty calibration chemicals
    used in environmental laboratories, for $62 million in
    cash, including the



assumption of $4 million of debt. ERA also provides product
    support services required to help laboratories with their
    federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with
    quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis. In
    February 2006, the Company acquired the net assets of the food
    safety business of VICAM Limited Partnership (“VICAM”)
    for $14 million in cash. VICAM is a leading provider of
    tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins in various
    agricultural commodities. The Company’s test kits provide
    reliable, quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins
    through the choice of flurometer, LC-MS or HPLC. The APG, ERA
    and VICAM acquisitions have all been integrated into the
    chromatography column product line.

In June 2007, the Company made an equity investment in Thar
    Instruments, Inc. (“Thar”), a privately held global
    leader in the design, development and manufacture of analytical
    and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and
    supercritical fluid extraction systems, for $4 million in
    cash. This investment is accounted for under the cost method of
    accounting. On February 2, 2009, the Company acquired all
    of the remaining outstanding capital stock of Thar for
    $36 million, including the assumption of $4 million of
    debt.

Based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and
    publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company
    believes that it is one of the world’s largest
    manufacturers and distributors of LC instruments, chromatography
    columns and other consumables and related services. The Company
    also believes that it has the leading LC market share in the
    United States, Europe and Asia and believes it has a leading
    market share position in Japan.

Mass
    Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is
    used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials
    and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of
    molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that
    have been converted into ions.

The Company believes it is a market leader in the development,
    manufacture, sale and distribution of MS instruments. These
    instruments can be integrated and used along with other
    complementary analytical instruments and systems, such as LC,
    chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis
    chromatography and gas chromatography. A wide variety of
    instrumental designs fall within the overall category of MS
    instrumentation, including devices that incorporate quadrupole,
    ion trap, time of flight (“Tof”) and classical
    magnetic sector technologies. Furthermore, these technologies
    are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain
    experiments.

Currently, the Company offers a wide range of MS instruments
    utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof, ion mobility
    and magnetic sector designs. These instruments are used in drug
    discovery and development, as well as for environmental testing.
    The majority of mass spectrometers sold by the Company are
    designed to utilize an LC system as the sample introduction
    device. These products supply a diverse market with a strong
    emphasis on the life science, pharmaceutical, biomedical,
    clinical and environmental market segments worldwide.

The mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection
    device for LC. The Company’s smaller-sized mass
    spectrometers (such as the SQD and the TQD) are often referred
    to as LC “detectors” and are either sold as part of an
    LC system or as an LC upgrade. Large quadrupole systems, such as
    the
    Xevo

tm

TQ and Quattro
    Premier

tm

XE instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for
    late-stage drug development, including clinical trial testing,
    and
    Q-Tof

tm

instruments, such as the Company’s
    Synapt

tm

MS, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease
    processes, an application sometimes referred to as
    “proteomics”. In late 2006, the Company introduced a
    new tandem quadrupole device, the TQD, and a new hybrid
    quadrupole-time of flight technology system, the
    Synapt

tm

HDMS

tm

.

    The Synapt HDMS system integrates ion mobility technology within
    a Q-Tof geometry instrument configuration and uniquely allows
    researchers to glean molecular shape information, a novel
    capability for a mass spectrometry instrument. In 2008, the
    Company introduced a new Q-Tof instrument called the Synapt MS.
    This instrument is an improved version of the Q-Tof
    Premier

tm

that customers may opt to upgrade to Synapt HDMS capability. In
    late 2008, the Xevo quadrupole time-of-flight (QTof) mass
    spectrometer (MS), an exact mass MS/MS bench-top instrument was
    introduced. The introduction of these new products has augmented
    the growth of the MS instrument systems.



LC-MS

LC and MS are instrumental technologies often embodied within an
    analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of
    analyses or as a general purpose analytical device. An
    increasing percentage of the Company’s customers are
    purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it is
    becoming common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within
    the same laboratory and be operated by the same user. The
    descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical
    segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical
    categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly
    in today’s instrument market, this segmentation and
    categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of
    instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS
    technologies as part of a single device. In response to this
    development and to further promote the high utilization of these
    hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters
    Division to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated
    LC-MS systems.

Service

The servicing and support of LC and MS instruments and
    accessories is an important source of revenue for the Waters
    Division. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale
    of support plans, demand service, customer training and
    performance validation services. Support plans most typically
    involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to
    promptly repair a non-functioning instrument in return for a fee
    described in a contract that is priced according to the
    configuration of the instrument.

TA
    DIVISION

Thermal
    Analysis, Rheometry and Calorimetry

Thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of
    materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature
    affect several characteristics of materials, such as their
    physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical
    properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal
    analysis techniques, including calorimetry. Consequently,
    thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development,
    production and characterization of materials in various
    industries, such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles,
    pharmaceuticals and electronics.

Rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in
    characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow
    properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity
    and deformation under different types of “loading” or
    conditions. The information obtained under such conditions
    provides insight into a material’s behavior during
    manufacturing, transport, usage and storage.

Thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are heavily used in
    material testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide
    information useful in predicting the suitability of polymers and
    viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
    healthcare products. As with systems offered through the Waters
    Division, a range of instrumental configurations are available
    with increasing levels of sample handling and information
    processing automation. In addition, systems and accompanying
    software packages can be tailored for specific applications. For
    example, the
    Q-Series

tm

family of differential scanning calorimeters includes a range of
    instruments, from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive
    systems, that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a
    variety of sample cells and temperature control features for
    analyzing a broad range of materials. In 2006, TA introduced
    four new differential scanning calorimeters. During 2005, TA
    introduced a new thermogravimetric analyzer (“TGA”),
    the Q5000IR TGA, and a new AR-G2 rheometer. The introduction of
    these new products significantly helped grow the TA business in
    2008, 2007 and 2006.

In July 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of VTI
    Corporation (“VTI”), a manufacturer of sorption
    analysis and thermogravimetric analysis instruments, for
    $3 million in cash. VTI’s products are widely used in
    the evaluation of pharmaceuticals, catalysts and energy-related
    materials. This acquisition adds two technologies which
    complement TA’s existing gravimetric analysis product line.
    VTI sorption analysis products are designed for water and
    organic vapor sorption studies of pharmaceuticals and related
    materials. VTI’s high pressure, high vacuum TGA projects
    are designed for high pressure sorption studies which are
    commonly used in the analysis of energy-related materials.



In August 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Calorimetry Sciences Corporation
    (“CSC”), a privately held company that designs,
    develops and manufactures highly sensitive calorimeters, for
    $7 million in cash, including the assumption of
    $1 million of liabilities. CSC products and services are
    primarily used in the life sciences industry. This acquisition
    adds two systems which complement TA’s existing TAM
    micro-calorimeter product line. The Nano-ITC is an isothermal
    titration calorimeter designed to measure protein-ligand binding
    and the interaction of biological materials. The Nano-DSC is an
    ultra-sensitive scanning calorimeter used to measure the
    stability of proteins and other macromolecules in dilute
    solutions and is commonly used in pharmaceutical development
    processes.

In August 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Thermometric AB (“Thermometric”), a
    manufacturer of high performance micro-calorimeters, for
    $3 million in cash, including the assumption of
    $1 million of debt. Thermometric’s flagship product,
    the TAM III, is a modular calorimeter that employs proprietary
    technology to deliver calorimetric sensitivity and temperature
    stability. It is used to characterize materials and their
    interactions in the fields of pharmaceuticals, life and
    materials sciences. The TAM III systems complement TA’s
    industry leading Q-Series differential scanning calorimeter
    product line and the CSC product lines acquired in 2007.
    Thermometric’s manufacturing and research and development
    were moved and consolidated with CSC late in 2008.

Service

The Company sells, supports and services these product offerings
    through TA, headquartered in New Castle, Delaware. TA operates
    independently from the Waters Division, though several of its
    overseas offices are situated in Waters facilities. TA has
    dedicated field sales and service operations. Service sales are
    primarily derived from the sale of replacement parts and from
    billed labor fees associated with the repair, maintenance and
    upgrade of installed systems.

Customers

The Company has a broad and diversified customer base that
    includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts,
    universities and government agencies. The pharmaceutical segment
    represents the Company’s largest sector and includes
    multi-national pharmaceutical companies, generic drug
    manufacturers, contract research organizations (CROs) and
    biotechnology companies. The Company’s other industrial
    customers include chemical manufacturers, polymer manufacturers,
    food and beverage companies and environmental testing
    laboratories. The Company also sells to various universities and
    government agencies worldwide. The Company’s technical
    support staff works closely with its customers in developing and
    implementing applications that meet their full range of
    analytical requirements.

The Company does not rely on any single customer or one group of
    customers for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal
    years 2008, 2007 and 2006, no single customer accounted for more
    than 3% of the Company’s net sales.

Sales and
    Service

The Company has one of the largest sales and service
    organizations in the industry, focused exclusively on the
    various instrument systems installed base. Across these product
    technologies, using respective specialized sales and service
    forces, the Company serves its customer base with approximately
    2,600 field representatives in 88 sales offices throughout the
    world as of December 31, 2008, compared to approximately
    2,500 field representatives in 86 sales offices as of
    December 31, 2007. The Company’s sales representatives
    have direct responsibility for account relationships, while
    service representatives work in the field to install instruments
    and minimize instrument downtime for customers. Technical
    support representatives work directly with customers, helping
    them to develop applications and procedures. The Company
    provides customers with comprehensive information through
    various corporate and regional internet web sites and product
    literature, and also makes consumable products available through
    electronic ordering facilities and a dedicated catalog.



Manufacturing

The Company provides high quality LC products by controlling
    each stage of the production of its instruments, columns and
    chemical reagents. The Company currently assembles a portion of
    its LC instruments at its facility in Milford, Massachusetts,
    where it performs machining, assembly and testing. The Milford
    facility maintains a quality management system in accordance
    with the requirements of ISO 9001:2000, ISO 13485:2003 and
    applicable regulatory requirements (including FDA Quality System
    Regulations and the European In-Vitro Diagnostics Directives).
    The Company outsources manufacturing of certain electronic
    components, such as computers, monitors and circuit boards, to
    outside vendors that can meet the Company’s quality
    requirements. In 2006, the Company transitioned the
    manufacturing of the Alliance HPLC instrument system to a
    company in Singapore. The Company expects to continue pursuing
    outsourcing opportunities.

The Company manufactures its LC columns at its facilities in
    Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland, where it processes,
    sizes and treats silica and polymeric media that are packed into
    columns, solid phase extraction cartridges and bulk shipping
    containers. The Wexford facility also manufactures and
    distributes certain data, instruments and software components
    for the Company’s LC, MS and TA Division product lines.
    These facilities meet the same ISO and FDA standards met by the
    Milford, Massachusetts facility and are registered with the FDA.
    VICAM manufactures antibody resin and magnetic beads that are
    packed into columns and kits in Watertown, Massachusetts and
    Nixa, Missouri. ERA manufactures environmental proficiency kits
    in Arvada, Colorado.

The Company manufactures most of its MS products at its
    facilities in Manchester, England; Cheshire, England and
    Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the
    Company’s MS instruments are manufactured by long-standing
    outside contractors. Each stage of this supply chain is closely
    monitored by the Company to maintain high quality and
    performance standards. The instruments, components or modules
    are then returned to the Company’s facilities where its
    engineers perform final assembly, calibrations to customer
    specifications and quality control procedures. The
    Company’s MS facilities meet similar ISO and FDA standards
    met by the Milford, Massachusetts facility and are registered
    with the FDA.

Thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry products are
    manufactured by TA. Thermal analysis products are manufactured
    at the Company’s New Castle, Delaware facility. Rheometry
    products are manufactured at the Company’s New Castle,
    Delaware and Crawley, England facilities. CSC and Thermometric
    manufacture high performance calorimeters in Lindon, Utah. VTI
    manufactures sorption analysis and thermogravimetric analysis
    instruments in Hialeah, FL. Similar to MS, elements of TA’s
    products are manufactured by outside contractors and are then
    returned to the Company’s facilities for final assembly,
    calibration and quality control. The Company’s thermal
    analysis facilities are certified to ISO 9001:2000 standards.

Research
    and Development

The Company maintains an active research and development program
    focused on the development and commercialization of products
    that both complement and update the existing product offering.
    The Company’s research and development expenditures for
    2008, 2007 and 2006 were $82 million, $81 million and
    $77 million, respectively. Nearly all of the current LC
    products of the Company have been developed at the
    Company’s main research and development center located in
    Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the
    Company’s extensive field organizations. The majority of
    the MS products have been developed at facilities in England and
    nearly all of the current thermal analysis products have been
    developed at the Company’s research and development center
    in New Castle, Delaware. At December 31, 2008, there were
    646 employees involved in the Company’s research and
    development efforts, compared to 628 employees in 2007. The
    Company has increased research and development expenses relating
    to acquisitions and the Company’s continued commitment to
    invest significantly in new product development and existing
    product enhancements. Despite the Company’s active research
    and development programs, there can be no assurances that the
    Company’s product development and commercialization efforts
    will be successful or that the products developed by the Company
    will be accepted by the marketplace.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 5,000 employees at both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. Approximately 44% and 47% of
    the Company’s employees were located in the United States
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007,



respectively. The Company believes its employee relations are
    generally good. The Company’s employees are not unionized
    or affiliated with any internal or external labor organizations.
    The Company believes that its future success largely depends
    upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled
    employees.

Competition

The analytical instrument and systems market is highly
    competitive. The Company encounters competition from several
    worldwide instrument manufacturers and other companies in both
    domestic and foreign markets for each of its three technologies.
    The Company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of
    instrument performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser
    extent, price. Some competitors have instrument businesses that
    are generally more diversified than the Company’s business
    but are typically less focused on the Company’s chosen
    markets. Some competitors have greater financial and other
    resources than the Company.

In the markets served by the Waters Division, the Company’s
    principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., Life
    Technologies, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Varian, Inc.,
    Shimadzu Corporation, Dionex Corporation and Bruker BioSciences
    Corporation. In the markets served by the TA Division, the
    Company’s principal competitors include: PerkinElmer Inc.,
    Mettler-Toledo International Inc., NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH,
    Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern Instruments Ltd.,
    Anton-Paar and General Electric Corporation. The Company is not
    currently aware of a competitor that it believes offers an
    instrument system comparable to its ACQUITY UPLC.

The market for consumable LC products, including separation
    columns, is highly competitive and more fragmented than the
    analytical instruments market. The Company encounters
    competition in the consumable columns market from chemical
    companies that produce column chemicals and small specialized
    companies that pack and distribute columns. The Company believes
    that it is one of the few suppliers that process silica, packs
    columns and distributes its own product. The Company competes in
    this market on the basis of reproducibility, reputation,
    performance and, to a lesser extent, price. The Company’s
    principal competitors for consumable products include:
    Phenomenex, Supelco Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., General
    Electric Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Merck
    and Co., Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to offer a
    predictable level of performance when used with ACQUITY UPLC
    columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the
    ACQUITY UPLC instrument base will enhance its chromatographic
    column business because of the high level of synergy between
    ACQUITY UPLC columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instrument.

Patents,
    Trademarks and Licenses

The Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents
    and has patent applications pending in the United States and
    abroad. Certain technology and software is licensed from third
    parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The
    Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as
    valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes
    that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is,
    in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss
    would materially affect the Company’s business as a whole.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws,
    regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or
    operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as
    discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal
    practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose
    liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages
    resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases
    of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently
    conducts its operations and has operated its business in the
    past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental
    laws. From time to time, operations of the Company have resulted
    or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or
    liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The
    Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse
    effect on its operations, financial condition or competitive
    position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental
    laws.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

Global
    Economic Conditions

Global economic conditions have recently deteriorated
    significantly, which has and will continue to have an
    unpredictable impact on demand for the Company’s products.
    These conditions resulted in a decline in demand for the
    Company’s products and services in the fourth quarter of
    2008. There can be no assurance that there will not be a further
    deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major
    economies. Any further deterioration or prolonged disruption in
    the financial markets or market conditions generally may result
    in reduced demand for the Company’s products and services.
    The Company’s global business may also be adversely
    affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity
    as a result of the economic and financial market situations.



Financial
    Market Conditions

Financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have been
    experiencing extreme disruption in recent months, including,
    among other things, a sharp increase in the cost of new capital,
    severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced
    liquidity in money markets. Financial and banking institutions
    have also experienced disruptions, resulting in large asset
    write-downs, higher cost of capital, rating downgrades and
    reduced desire to lend money. While currently these conditions
    have not impacted the Company’s ability to access its
    existing cash or borrow on its existing revolving credit
    facility, there can be no assurance that there will not be
    further deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial
    markets or financial institutions. Any further deterioration or
    prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial
    institutions may impair the Company’s ability to access its
    existing cash and revolving credit facility, and impair its
    ability to access sources of new capital and increase the cost
    of any new capital raised.

Reliance
    on Customer Demand

The demand for the Company’s products is dependent upon the
    size of the markets for its LC, MS, thermal analysis and
    rheometry products; the timing and level of capital expenditures
    of the Company’s customers; changes in government
    regulations; funding available to academic and government
    institutions; general economic conditions and the rate of
    economic growth in the Company’s major markets and
    competitive considerations. The Company typically experiences an
    increase in sales in its fourth quarter, as a result of
    purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to
    exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. There can
    be no assurances that the Company’s results of operations
    or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a
    change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of
    weakness in global economic conditions.

Additionally, the analytical instrument market may, from time to
    time, experience low sales growth. Approximately 50% and 52% of
    the Company’s net sales in 2008 and 2007, respectively,
    were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    industries, which may be periodically subject to unfavorable
    market conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable industry
    conditions could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

Competition
    and the Analytical Instrument Market

The analytical instrument market and, in particular, the portion
    related to the Company’s HPLC, UPLC, MS, LC-MS, thermal
    analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines, is highly
    competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. The
    Company encounters competition from several international
    instrument manufacturers and other companies in both domestic
    and foreign markets. Some competitors have instrument businesses
    that are generally more diversified than the Company’s
    business but are typically less focused on the Company’s
    chosen markets. There can be no assurances that the
    Company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and
    less costly products than those of the Company or that the
    Company will be able to increase its sales and profitability
    from new product introductions. There can be no assurances that
    the Company’s sales and marketing forces will compete
    successfully against its competitors in the future.

Risk of
    Disruption of Operations

The Company manufactures LC instruments at facilities in
    Milford, Massachusetts and Singapore; chemistry separation
    columns at its facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford,
    Ireland; MS products at its facilities in Manchester, England,
    Cheshire, England and Wexford, Ireland; thermal analysis
    products at its facility in New Castle, Delaware; rheometry
    products at its facilities in New Castle, Delaware and Crawley,
    England and other instruments and consumables at various other
    locations as a result of the Company’s 2008, 2007 and 2006
    acquisitions. Any prolonged disruption to the operations at any
    of these facilities, whether due to labor difficulties,
    destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons, could
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations or financial condition.

Foreign
    Operations and Exchange Rates

Approximately 70% and 68% of the Company’s net sales in
    2008 and 2007, respectively, were outside of the
    United States and were primarily denominated in foreign
    currencies. In addition, the Company has considerable
    manufacturing operations in Ireland, the United Kingdom and
    Singapore. As a result, a significant portion of the



Company’s sales and operations are subject to certain
    risks, including adverse developments in the foreign political
    and economic environment; tariffs and other trade barriers;
    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and
    potentially adverse tax consequences.

Additionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s
    net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses, interest, taxes
    and net income varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
    Significant increases or decreases in the value of the
    U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could
    have a material adverse effect or benefit on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial condition.

Reliance
    on Key Management

The operation of the Company requires managerial and operational
    expertise. None of the key management employees have an
    employment contract with the Company and there can be no
    assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company.
    If, for any reason, such key personnel do not continue to be
    active in management, the Company’s results of operations
    or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Protection
    of Intellectual Property

The Company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights
    and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as
    material and patentable. However, there can be no assurances
    that any patents held by the Company will not be challenged,
    invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted
    thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company.
    Conversely, there could be successful claims against the Company
    by third-party patent holders with respect to certain Company
    products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of
    such third parties. The Company’s patents, including those
    licensed from others, expire on various dates. If the Company is
    unable to protect its intellectual property rights, it could
    have an adverse and material effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial condition.

Reliance
    on Suppliers

Most of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by
    the Company are available from a number of different suppliers;
    however, a number of items are purchased from limited or single
    sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have a
    temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results
    of the Company. The Company believes alternative sources could
    ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials, but a
    prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components
    could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition or results of operations and could result in damage to
    its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely
    affect the Company’s business.

Reliance
    on Outside Manufacturers

Certain components or modules of the Company’s LC and MS
    instruments are manufactured by long-standing outside
    contractors. In April 2006, the Company transitioned the
    manufacturing of the Alliance HPLC instrument system to a
    company in Singapore. Disruptions of service by these outside
    contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and
    the financial results of the Company. The Company believes that
    it could obtain alternative sources for these components or
    modules, but a prolonged inability to obtain these components or
    modules could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition or results of operations.

Risk in
    Unexpected Shifts in Taxable Income between Tax
    Jurisdictions

The Company is subject to a range of income tax rates, from 0%
    to in excess of 35%, depending on specific tax jurisdictions
    around the world. The Company typically generates a substantial
    portion of its taxable income in the fourth quarter of each
    fiscal year. Shifts in actual taxable income from previous
    quarters’ projections due to factors, including, but not
    limited to, changes in volume and foreign currency translation
    rates, could have a notable favorable or unfavorable effect on
    the Company’s income tax expense and results of operations.

Levels of
    Debt and Debt Service Requirements

The Company had approximately $536 million in debt and
    $429 million in cash and cash equivalents as of
    December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company also has the ability to borrow an additional
    $599 million from its existing credit facilities. Most of
    the Company’s debt is in the U.S. There is a
    substantial cash



requirement in the U.S. to fund operations and capital
    expenditures, service debt interest obligations, finance
    potential acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase
    programs. A majority of the Company’s cash is maintained
    and generated from foreign operations. The Company’s
    financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
    impacted if the Company is unable to maintain a sufficient level
    of cash flow in the U.S. to address these requirements
    through cash from U.S. operations, efficient and timely
    repatriation of cash from overseas and other sources obtained at
    an acceptable cost.

Item 3:

Legal
    Proceedings

Agilent
    Technologies, Inc.

The Company filed suit in the United States against
    Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH (collectively,
    “HP”), seeking a declaration that certain products
    sold under the mark “Alliance” did not constitute an
    infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or its foreign
    subsidiaries (the “HP patents”). The action in the
    United States was dismissed for lack of controversy. Actions
    seeking revocation or nullification of foreign HP patents were
    filed by the Company in Germany, France and England. A German
    patent tribunal found the HP German patent to be valid. In
    Germany, France and England, HP and its successor, Agilent
    Technologies Deutschland GmbH (“Agilent”), brought
    actions alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump may
    infringe the HP patents. In England, the Court of Appeal found
    the HP patent valid and infringed. The Company’s petitions
    for leave to appeal to the House of Lords were denied. A trial
    on damages was scheduled for November 2004.

In March 2004, Agilent brought a new action against the Company
    alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump continued to
    infringe the HP patents. In December 2004, following a trial in
    the new action, the UK court ruled that the Company did not
    infringe the HP patents. Agilent filed an appeal in that action,
    which was heard in July 2005, and the UK Appellate Court upheld
    the lower court’s ruling of non-infringement. In December
    2005, a trial on damages commenced in the first action and
    continued for six days prior to a holiday recess. In February
    2006, the Company, HP and Agilent entered into a settlement
    agreement (the “Agilent Settlement Agreement”) with
    respect to the first action and a consent order dismissing the
    case was entered. The Agilent Settlement Agreement provides for
    the release of the Company and its UK affiliate from each and
    every claim under Agilent’s European patent (UK) number
    309,596 arising out of the prior sale by either of them of
    Alliance Separations Modules incorporating the patented
    technology. In consideration of entering into the Agilent
    Settlement Agreement and the consent order, the Company made a
    payment to Agilent of 3.5 million British Pounds, in full
    and final settlement of Agilent’s claim for damages and in
    relation to all claims for costs and interest in the case.

In France, the Paris District Court found the HP patent valid
    and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company appealed the
    French decision and, in April 2004, the French appeals court
    affirmed the Paris District Court’s finding of
    infringement. The Company filed a further appeal in the case and
    the appeal was dismissed in March 2007. The Company sought a
    declaration from the French court that, as was found in both the
    UK and Germany, certain modified features of the Alliance pump
    do not infringe the HP patents. A hearing on this matter was
    held in September 2007 and, in December 2007, the French court
    held that the modified features of the Alliance pump are
    non-infringing. Agilent has appealed this ruling and no decision
    has yet been rendered. In January 2009, the French appeals court
    affirmed that the Company had infringed the Agilent patent and a
    judgment was issued against the Company. The Company has
    appealed this judgment. In the meantime, however, the Company
    has recorded a



$7 million provision in 2008 for damages and fees estimated
    to be incurred in connection with this case. The accrued patent
    litigation expense is in other current liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2008.

In the German case, a German court found the patent infringed.
    The Company appealed the German decision and, in December 2004,
    the German appeals court reversed the trial court and issued a
    finding of non-infringement in favor of the Company. Agilent
    sought an appeal in that action and the appeal was heard in
    April 2007. Following the hearing, the German Federal Court of
    Justice set aside the judgment of the appeals court and remanded
    the case back to the appeals court for further proceedings. In
    2008, the appeals court found the patent infringed. The Company
    has appealed this finding to the German Federal Court of
    Justice. In July 2005, Agilent brought a new action against the
    Company alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump
    continued to infringe the HP patents. In August 2006, following
    a trial in this new action the German court ruled that the
    Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent filed an appeal
    in this action. A hearing on this appeal was held in January
    2008. The appeals court affirmed the finding of the trial court
    that the Company did not infringe. Agilent has appealed this
    finding to the German Federal Court of Justice.

The Company recorded provisions in 2004, 2005 and 2008 for
    estimated damages, legal fees and court costs to be incurred
    with respect to this ongoing litigation. The provisions
    represent management’s best estimate of the probable and
    reasonably estimable loss related to the litigations.

Other

In November 2008, the City of Dearborn Heights Act 345
    Police & Fire Retirement System commenced a class
    action lawsuit against the Company in the United States District
    Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint alleges
    that the Company misrepresented its projected revenues and
    earnings, its effective tax rates and the level of business
    activity in Japan between January 24, 2007 and
    January 22, 2008, when the Company released earnings for
    the fourth quarter of 2007. The complaint asserts that the
    Company and Messrs. Berthiaume and Ornell violated the
    federal securities laws by misrepresenting or failing to fully
    disclose the above referenced information. The plaintiff class
    is allegedly comprised of purchasers of common stock that were
    injured during the time period stated above. In January 2009,
    Inter-Local Pension Fund ABC/IBT filed a motion to be
    appointed as lead plaintiff. The Company intends to mount a
    vigorous defense.

EXECUTIVE
    OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

Officers of the Company are elected annually by the Board of
    Directors and hold office at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors. The following persons serve as executive officers of

Selected
    Financial Data

Reference is made to information contained in the section
    entitled “Selected Financial Data” and is incorporated
    by reference from page 73 of this

Form 10-K,

included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data, and should be considered an integral part of this
    Item 6.

Item 7:

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Business
    and Financial Overview

The Company’s sales were $1,575 million,
    $1,473 million and $1,280 million in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Sales grew 7% in 2008 over 2007 and 15% in
    2007 over 2006. Overall, the sales growth achieved in these
    years can be primarily attributed to the Company’s
    introduction of new products, the increase in chemistry
    consumable and service sales, the benefits from acquisitions and
    the effects of foreign currency translation. In the fourth
    quarter of 2008, the Company experienced the effects of reduced
    capital spending by the Company’s customers as a result of
    the global economic conditions and the sudden strengthening of
    the U.S. dollar. Company sales growth in the fourth



quarter of 2008 decreased from the fourth quarter of 2007 by 4%
    from the effects of foreign currency translation. The Company
    expects this effect of foreign currency trend to continue into
    2009.

During 2008 and 2007, U.S. sales increased 1% and 17%;
    European sales increased 7% and 17%; Asian sales (including
    Japan) increased 16% and 12%; and sales in the rest of the world
    increased 3% and 11%, respectively. The effect of currency
    translation benefited the 2008 and 2007 sales growth rate by 2%
    and by 3%, respectively, both increases principally resulting
    from European sales.

In 2008 and 2007, global sales to pharmaceutical customers grew
    3% and 13%, respectively. Global sales to government and
    academic customers were 10% higher in 2008 and 24% higher in
    2007 over the prior year, respectively, and can be primarily
    attributed to demand for the Company’s new products in the
    U.S. and Asia. Global sales to industrial and food safety
    customers grew 13% in 2008 and 16% in 2007 primarily as a result
    of new governmental regulatory testing requirements, higher
    awareness of food safety issues, higher chemistry consumable and
    service sales, the benefit from acquisitions and demand for the
    Company’s new products.

The Waters Division sales grew by 7% in 2008 and 14% in 2007.
    The Waters Division’s products and services consist of high
    performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra
    performance liquid
    chromatography

®

(“UPLC” and together with HPLC, herein referred to as
    “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and
    chemistry consumable products and related services. The Waters
    Division sales growth was strongly influenced by ACQUITY
    UPLC

®

sales, shipments of new
    Synapt

tm

HDMS

,

    Xevo

TQ and Synapt MS systems and recurring sales growth from the
    service and chemistry consumables business.

In December 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of
    Analytical Products Group, Inc. (“APG”), a provider of
    environmental testing products for quality control and
    proficiency testing used in environmental laboratories, for
    $5 million in cash. APG’s product sales in 2009 are
    expected to be approximately $4 million. In June 2007, the
    Company made an equity investment in Thar Instruments, Inc.
    (“Thar”), a privately held global leader in the
    design, development and manufacture of analytical and
    preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical
    fluid extraction systems, for $4 million in cash. On
    February 2, 2009, the Company acquired all of the remaining
    outstanding capital stock of Thar for $36 million,
    including the assumption of $4 million of debt. The Company
    expects that Thar will add approximately $20 million of
    product sales and be about neutral to earnings in 2009 after
    debt service costs.

Sales growth for the TA Division (“TA”) grew 10% and
    25% for 2008 and 2007, respectively. TA’s products and
    services consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry
    instrument systems and service sales. TA’s sales growth can
    be primarily attributed to new product introductions, the effect
    of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions.
    The effect of foreign currency translation benefited sales by 2%
    in 2008 and 3% in 2007. The July 2008 acquisition of VTI
    Corporation (“VTI”) and the August 2007 acquisition of
    Calorimetry Sciences Corporation (“CSC”) added 3% to
    TA’s sales growth in 2008. TA sales growth for 2007 also
    benefited from a larger than normal backlog of orders in 2006
    which were shipped in the first quarter of 2007, as well as the
    benefit of the CSC acquisition and the 2006 acquisition of
    Thermometric AB, which added 4% to TA’s sales growth.

Operating income was $390 million, $349 million and
    $295 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    $41 million net increase in operating income in 2008 over
    2007 is primarily a result of the benefits from an increase in
    sales volume, the favorable effect of foreign currency
    translation and the impact of a one-time $12 million
    expense recorded in 2007 related to the contribution into the
    Waters Employee Investment Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution
    plan for U.S. employees. This 2008 increase was partially
    offset by a patent litigation provision of $7 million and
    the $9 million impact of an out-of-period capitalized
    software amortization adjustment recorded during the three
    months ended June 28, 2008. The $54 million net
    increase in operating income in 2007 over 2006 is primarily a
    result of the benefits from an increase in sales volume and the
    impact of $8 million of restructuring costs recorded in
    2006 relating to the February 2006 cost reduction initiative
    being offset by the $12 million expense recorded in 2007
    related to the transitional contribution into the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan.

Net income per diluted share was $3.21, $2.62 and $2.13 in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Net income per diluted share grew
    at a rate of 23% in both 2008 over 2007 and 2007 over 2006,
    respectively.

During the second quarter of 2008, the Company identified errors
    originating in periods prior to the three months ended
    June 28, 2008. The errors primarily related to (i) an
    overstatement of the Company’s income tax



expense of $16 million as a result of errors in recording
    its income tax provision during the period from 2000 to
    March 29, 2008 and (ii) an understatement of
    amortization expense of $9 million for certain capitalized
    software. The Company incorrectly calculated its provision for
    income taxes by tax-effecting its tax liability utilizing a
    U.S. tax rate of 35% instead of an Irish tax rate of 10%.
    In addition, the Company incorrectly accounted for

Irish-based

capitalized software and the related amortization expense as
    U.S. Dollar-denominated instead of

Euro-denominated,

resulting in an understatement of amortization expense and
    cumulative translation adjustment. The out-of-period adjustment
    increased the 2008 net income per diluted share by $0.08.

In addition, the Company recorded a one-time $5 million tax
    provision in the third quarter of 2008 associated with the
    reorganization of certain foreign legal entities in October
    2008. This $5 million tax provision decreased net income
    per diluted share by $0.05 in 2008. These entities were
    effectively liquidated into the U.S. to better align the
    Company’s legal entity structure with its current business
    objectives. The majority of this legal entity reorganization
    qualifies as a tax-free liquidation and it resulted in the
    Company being able to utilize $572 million of cash and
    short-term investments domestically. In February 2009, the
    U.S. Treasury promulgated changes in income tax regulations
    that eliminate concerns with respect to the $5 million
    unrecognized tax benefit that was originally recorded in the
    third quarter of 2008 through the Company’s tax provision.
    Because these changes in income tax regulations were promulgated
    during the first quarter of 2009, the Company will record this
    $5 million item as a recognized tax benefit and, therefore,
    as a reduction of its income tax provision for the first quarter
    of 2009.

In October 2008, the Company utilized the cash from the
    reorganization described above to voluntarily prepay the
    $150 million term loan under the credit agreement entered
    into in March 2008 (the “2008 Credit Agreement”).
    There was no penalty for prepaying the term loan and the
    repayment of the term loan effectively terminated all lending
    arrangements under the 2008 Credit Agreement. In addition, the
    Company utilized these cash balances to voluntarily repay
    $340 million of revolving outstanding debt under the credit
    agreement entered into in January 2007 (the “2007 Credit
    Agreement”). The Company prepaid debt in order to reduce
    the Company’s exposure to leverage and interest rate risk
    in the currently volatile capital and investment markets.

The Company also recorded a $7 million provision in 2008
    for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with
    a judgment issued against the Company relating to an ongoing
    patent infringement lawsuit with Agilent Technologies, Inc. This
    litigation provision decreased net income per diluted share by
    $0.04 in 2008.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million,
    $371 million and $264 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The $47 million increase in operating cash
    flow in 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily the result of
    higher net income and improved cash collections from customers,
    partially offset by a $13 million one-time transition
    benefit payment into the Waters Employee Investment Plan that
    was expensed in 2007, increases in inventory and the timing of
    payments to vendors. The $107 million increase in operating
    cash flow in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily the result of
    higher net income, the leveling off of an inventory

ramp-up

in
    2006 for new product introductions and an increase in safety
    stock related to the outsourcing to Singapore and the timing of
    payments to vendors. In addition, the 2006 operating cash flow
    included a $9 million tax payment associated with the
    American Jobs Creation Act (“AJCA”), $7 million
    of severance and other facility-related payments made in
    connection with the cost reduction initiative and a
    $4 million litigation payment.

Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital
    expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software
    capitalization were $69 million, $60 million and
    $51 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In
    December 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of APG for
    $5 million in cash. In July 2008, the Company paid
    $3 million in cash to acquire the net assets of VTI. In
    August 2007, the Company paid $7 million in cash, including
    the assumption of $1 million of liabilities, for CSC. In
    June 2007, the Company made an equity investment in Thar for
    $4 million in cash. The Company continues to evaluate the
    acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to
    augment the Waters and TA operating divisions.

Within cash flows used in financing activities, the Company
    received $29 million, $91 million and $40 million
    of proceeds from stock plans in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts are primarily
    attributed to the change in the Company stock price and the
    expiration of stock option grants. In February 2007, the
    Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
    repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common
    stock over a two-year period. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company repurchased 4.1 million, 3.4 million and
    5.8 million shares at a cost of $235 million,
    $201 million and $249 million under the February 2007
    authorization



and previously announced stock repurchase programs. In February
    2009, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
    Company to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of
    its outstanding common stock over a

two-year

period. The Company believes that it has the financial
    flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash
    and debt levels and invest in research, technology and business
    acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and
    profits.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Net Sales

Net sales for 2008 and 2007 were $1,575 million and
    $1,473 million, respectively, an increase of 7%. Foreign
    currency translation benefited sales growth for 2008 by 2%.
    Product sales were $1,140 million and $1,088 million
    for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of 5%. The increase
    in product sales was primarily due to the overall positive
    growth in Waters and TA instrument systems, chemistry
    consumables and foreign currency translation benefits. Service
    sales were $435 million and $385 million in 2008 and
    2007, respectively, an increase of 13%. The increase in service
    sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of service
    plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers and
    foreign currency translation benefits.

Waters
    Division Net Sales

The Waters Division net sales grew 7% in 2008. The effect of
    foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division
    across all product lines, resulting in a benefit to total sales
    growth of 2%. Chemistry consumables sales grew 9% in 2008. This
    growth was driven by increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC
    proprietary column technology and sales of HPLC columns. Waters
    Division service sales grew 12% in 2008 due primarily to
    increased sales of service plans and billings to the higher
    installed base of customers. Waters instrument systems sales (LC
    and MS) grew 3% in 2008. The increase in instrument systems
    sales during 2008 is primarily attributable to higher sales of
    ACQUITY UPLC, Synapt HDMS, Synapt MS and the Xevo TQ. Sales were
    negatively impacted by the slowdown in industrial customer
    spending which occurred during fourth quarter of 2008 due to the
    economic recession. Waters Division sales by product line were
    essentially unchanged in 2008 and 2007 with instrument systems,
    chemistry consumables and service representing approximately
    55%, 17% and 28% of sales, respectively. Geographically, Waters
    Division sales in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world grew
    approximately 6%, 17% and 4% in 2008, respectively. Sales to the
    U.S. were flat in 2008. The sales growth in 2008 was
    primarily due to higher demand from the Company’s
    government, academic and industrial customers. Asia’s sales
    growth was primarily driven by increased sales in India and
    China. The effects of foreign currency translation increased
    sales growth in Europe and Asia by 4% and 5% in 2008,
    respectively.

TA
    Division Net Sales

TA’s sales grew 10% in 2008 primarily as a result of new
    product introductions, acquisitions and the effect of foreign
    currency translation. The effect of foreign currency translation
    benefited the TA sales growth by 2% in 2008. Instrument system
    sales grew 6% and represented approximately 78% and 81% of sales
    in 2008 and 2007, respectively. TA service sales grew 27% in
    2008 and can be primarily attributed to the higher installed
    base of customers and new service sales to the customers of
    recently acquired companies. Geographically, sales growth for TA
    in 2008 was predominantly in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The July
    2008 VTI acquisition and the August 2007 acquisition of CSC
    added 3% to TA’s sales growth for 2008.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit for 2008 was $914 million compared to
    $842 million for 2007, an increase of $72 million, or
    9%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.0% in
    2008 from 57.2% in 2007. This increase is primarily due to
    higher sales volume, increased comparative benefits of foreign
    currency translation and, to a lesser extent, lower
    manufacturing costs. Also, the overall gross profit increase was
    negatively impacted by a $9 million out-of-period
    capitalized software amortization adjustment recorded during
    2008. The gross profit increase can also be attributed to the
    $3 million expense recorded in 2007 relating to the
    contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan.



Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses for 2008 and 2007 were
    $427 million and $404 million, respectively, an
    increase of 6%. Included in selling and administrative expenses
    for 2007 is the impact of a one-time $7 million expense
    related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment
    Plan. The remaining $16 million increase in total selling
    and administrative expenses for 2008 is primarily due to annual
    merit increases, modest headcount additions to support increased
    sales volume and the comparative unfavorable impact of foreign
    currency translation. As a percentage of net sales, selling and
    administrative expenses were 27.1% for 2008 compared to 27.4%
    for 2007.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $82 million and
    $81 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of
    $1 million, or 1%. Included in research and development
    expenses for 2007 is $2 million of expense related to the
    contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The
    remaining increase in research and development expenses for 2008
    is primarily due to the timing of new product introduction
    costs, annual merit increases and modest headcount additions.

Litigation
    Provision

The Company has recorded a $7 million provision in 2008 for
    damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with a
    judgment issued against the Company relating to an ongoing
    patent infringement lawsuit with Agilent Technologies Inc.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $39 million and $57 million for
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is
    primarily attributable to a decrease in average borrowing costs
    and lower average borrowings during 2008 as compared to 2007.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $21 million and $31 million for
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest income is
    primarily due to lower yields and lower cash and short-term
    investment balances.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were
    13.4% and 17.1%, respectively. The 2008 effective tax rate
    includes a $5 million tax provision associated with the
    reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. This one-time
    provision increased the Company’s effective tax rate by
    1.4 percentage points for 2008. In February 2009, the
    U.S. Treasury promulgated changes in income tax regulations
    that eliminate concerns with respect to the $5 million
    unrecognized tax benefit that was originally recorded in the
    third quarter of 2008 through the Company’s tax provision.
    Because these changes in income tax regulations were promulgated
    during the first quarter of 2009, the Company will record this
    $5 million item as a recognized tax benefit and, therefore,
    as a reduction of its income tax provision for the first quarter
    of 2009.

The 2008 tax provision also contains out-of-period adjustments
    to correct errors relating to capitalized software amortization
    and the income tax provision. The $16 million tax benefit
    from the out-of-period adjustments reduced the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points for 2008. The
    2007 tax provision includes a $4 million tax benefit
    associated with a one-time contribution into the Waters Employee
    Investment Plan. The remaining decrease in the effective tax
    rate for 2008 is primarily attributable to proportionately
    greater growth in income in jurisdictions with comparatively
    lower effective tax rates.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2006

Net
    Sales

Net sales for 2007 and 2006 were $1,473 million and
    $1,280 million, respectively, an increase of 15%. Foreign
    currency translation benefited sales growth for 2007 by 3%.
    Product sales were $1,088 million and $936 million for
    2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of 16%. The increase in
    product sales was primarily due to the overall positive growth
    in Waters and TA instrument systems, chemistry consumables and
    the effect of acquisitions. The impact of 2006 acquisitions
    accounted for 2% of the product sales growth in 2007. Service
    sales were $385 million



and $344 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, an
    increase of 12%. The increase in service sales was primarily
    attributable to growth in the Company’s installed base of
    instruments and higher sales of service contracts.

Waters
    Division Net Sales

The Waters Division net sales grew 14% in 2007. The effect of
    foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division sales
    growth by 3%. Chemistry consumables sales grew 24% in 2007. This
    growth was driven by increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC
    proprietary column technology products, new
    XBridge

tm

columns,
    Oasis

®

sample preparation products and sales associated with the 2006
    acquisitions (Environmental Resources Associates
    (“ERA”) and VICAM Limited Partnership
    (“VICAM”) product lines). These acquisitions benefited
    the chemistry consumable sales growth rate by 9%. Waters
    Division service sales grew 11% in 2007 due to increased sales
    of service plans to the higher installed base of customers.
    Waters instrument systems sales grew 13% in 2007. The increase
    in instrument systems sales during 2007 is primarily
    attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC and Synapt HDMS
    system sales. Waters Division sales by product mix were
    essentially unchanged in 2007 and 2006 with instrument systems,
    chemistry and service representing approximately 56%, 17% and
    27% of sales, respectively. Geographically, Waters Division
    sales in the U.S., Europe and Asia strengthened approximately
    15%, 16% and 10% in 2007, respectively. Sales to the rest of the
    world increased 10% in 2007. The effects of foreign currency
    translation increased sales growth by 9% in Europe and increased
    sales growth in Asia by 1% in 2007. U.S., Europe and Asia sales
    growth in 2007 was primarily due to higher demand from the
    Company’s pharmaceutical and industrial customers. The
    growth in Europe was broad-based across most major countries,
    particularly in Eastern Europe. Asia’s growth was primarily
    driven by increased sales in India and China which was offset by
    a 1% sales decrease in Japan. Japan’s 2007 instrument
    systems and consumable sales were impacted by strong 2006 sales
    attributed to drinking water and food safety regulation changes.

TA
    Division Net Sales

TA’s sales grew 25% in 2007 primarily as a result of
    TA’s new product introductions, strong sales growth in the
    U.S. and Europe and expansion of its Asian businesses, as
    well as a larger than normal backlog of orders in 2006 which
    were shipped in the first quarter of 2007. The sales growth rate
    in 2007 also benefited from the CSC and Thermometric
    acquisitions which added 4% to the TA sales growth rate. The
    effect of foreign currency translation benefited the TA sales
    growth by 3% in 2007. Instrument system sales grew 25% and
    represented approximately 81% of sales in both 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. TA service sales grew 25% in 2007 and can be
    primarily attributed to the higher installed base of customers.
    Geographically, sales growth for 2007 was strongest in the U.S.,
    Europe and Asia.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit for 2007 was $842 million compared to
    $744 million for 2006, an increase of $98 million, or
    13%, and is generally consistent with the increase in net sales.
    Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 57.2% in 2007
    from 58.1% in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to increased
    sales of new products which have higher manufacturing costs and
    the unfavorable foreign currency impact related to the cost of
    products manufactured in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In
    addition, gross profit was negatively impacted by the
    $3 million expense recorded in 2007 related to the
    contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan.

Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses for 2007 and 2006 were
    $404 million and $358 million, respectively, an
    increase of 13%. Included in selling and administrative expenses
    for 2007 is a $7 million expense related to the
    contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The
    remaining $39 million increase in total selling and
    administrative expenses for 2007 is primarily due to annual
    merit increases across most divisions, headcount additions to
    support increased sales volume, costs from new acquisitions and
    the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. As a
    percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses
    were 27.4% for 2007 compared to 27.9% for 2006.



Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $81 million and
    $77 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of
    $4 million, or 4%. The increase in research and development
    expenses is primarily due to the $2 million expense related
    to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan.

    Restructuring

In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan,
    primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe, that
    resulted in the employment of 74 employees being
    terminated, all of which had left the Company as of
    December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company closed a sales
    and demonstration office in the Netherlands in the second
    quarter of 2006. The Company implemented this cost reduction
    plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business
    opportunities around the world. The Company does not expect to
    incur any additional charges in connection with the February
    2006 cost reduction initiative.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s
    restructuring liability included in other current liabilities on
    the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands):

    Expense, Net

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
    $6 million charge for an other-than-temporary impairment to
    an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
    (“Caprion”). The charge was recorded in 2006 when the
    Company learned that Caprion’s financial condition had
    deteriorated and a merger was in process that, in the
    Company’s assessment, would result in the Company’s
    investment being substantially diminished. In March 2007,
    Caprion merged with Ecopia BioSciences Inc. and is now named
    Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Thallion”). Thallion
    is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the
    Company’s investment is accounted for under Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 115,
    “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities”. The market value of the Thallion investment
    was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2007 and
    was $2 million as of December 31 2006.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $57 million and $52 million for
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest expense is
    primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings in
    the U.S. to fund stock repurchase programs and, to a lesser
    extent, an increase in interest rates on the Company’s
    outstanding debt during 2007.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $31 million and $25 million for
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest income is
    primarily due to higher invested cash balances.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were
    17.1% and 15.5%, respectively. This net increase is primarily
    attributable to increased net income in jurisdictions with
    comparatively higher tax rates. Included in the 2007 tax
    provision is a tax benefit of $4 million associated with
    the charge related to the contribution into the Waters Employee
    Investment Plan.

Cash Flow
    from Operating Activities

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million
    and $371 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    $47 million increase in net cash provided from operating
    activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is attributed primarily to
    the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net
    cash provided from operating activities, aside from the increase
    in net income:

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2008 compared to 2007 is
    primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by
    customers and the higher sales volume in 2008 as compared to
    2007. Days-sales-outstanding (“DSO”) decreased to
    63 days at December 31, 2008 from 66 days at
    December 31, 2007.

•

The change in inventories in 2008 and 2007 is attributable to
    the increase in sales volume and an increase in ACQUITY UPLC and
    new mass spectrometry and TA products.

•

The 2008 change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities includes a $13 million one-time transition
    pension benefit payment into the Waters Employee Investment
    Plan. The 2007 change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities includes the accrual related to the one-time
    transition benefit. In addition, accounts payable and other
    current liabilities changed as a result of the timing of
    payments to vendors.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in
    both 2008 and 2007 was a result of the installed base of
    customers renewing annual service contracts.

•

Other changes are comprised of the timing of various provisions,
    expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets
    and other liabilities.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2006

Net cash provided by operating activities was $371 million
    and $264 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    $107 million increase in net cash provided from operating
    activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is attributed



primarily to the following significant changes in the sources
    and uses of net cash provided from operating activities, aside
    from the increase in net income:

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2007 compared to 2006 is
    primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by
    customers and the higher sales volume in 2007 as compared to
    2006. DSO increased to 66 days at December 31, 2007
    from 64 days at December 31, 2006.

•

Inventory growth was much lower in 2007 compared to 2006
    primarily due to 2006 having a higher

ramp-up

of
    new products launched later in that year and the increased
    levels of Alliance inventory during the 2006 outsourcing
    transition to Singapore.

•

The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities
    and other changes in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily
    attributable to the reclassification within these line items of
    certain income tax liabilities from current to long-term
    liabilities required by the adoption of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”). See Note 10, “Income
    Taxes”, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information. The overall net change in these
    items can be attributed to an increase in accounts payable and
    accrued expenses resulting from the timing of payments to
    vendors, an increase in income tax liabilities and an increase
    in accrued compensation resulting from a $13 million
    contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan partially
    offset by the reduction in the pension liability relating to the
    freezing of the U.S. Pension Plans. The one-time
    contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan was made
    in the first quarter of 2008.

•

The 2006 change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities was also impacted by a $9 million tax payment
    related to the distribution and repatriation of cash under the
    AJCA, $7 million of severance and other facility-related
    payments made in connection with the cost reduction initiative
    and a $4 million litigation payment to settle the Agilent
    litigation.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in
    both 2007 and 2006 was a result of the installed base of
    customers renewing annual service contracts.

Cash Used
    in Investing Activities

Net cash provided by investing activities totaled
    $19 million in 2008 compared to net cash used in investing
    activities which totaled $168 million in 2007 and
    $130 million in 2006. Additions to fixed assets and
    software capitalization were $69 million in 2008,
    $60 million in 2007 and $51 million in 2006. Capital
    spending and software capitalization additions were consistent
    with historical capital spending trends. During 2008 and 2007,
    the Company purchased $20 million and $391 million of
    short-term investments while $115 million and
    $295 million of short-term investments matured,
    respectively. Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were
    $8 million, $9 million and $79 million in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, in 2007, the Company
    received $1 million from the former shareholders of ERA in
    connection with the finalization of the purchase price in
    accordance with the purchase and sales agreement. In June 2007,
    the Company made an equity investment in Thar for
    $4 million in cash.

In October 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to
    purchase land adjacent to its TA facility in Delaware for
    approximately $7 million. The Company plans to construct a
    new 150,000 square foot facility in 2009 that will
    consolidate TA’s existing Delaware operations and
    accommodate future expansion at a cost of approximately
    $26 million. In addition, the Company entered into a lease
    termination agreement with its existing Delaware landlord that
    requires the Company to pay a lease termination fee of
    approximately $5 million when the Company vacates the
    existing leased property. The Company expects to vacate the
    leased property in the middle of 2009 once the construction of
    the new facility is complete.

Cash Used
    in Financing Activities

During 2008 and 2007, the Company’s net debt borrowings
    decreased by $348 million and $19 million,
    respectively, compared to an increase of $72 million in
    2006.



In March 2008, the Company entered into the 2008 Credit
    Agreement that provides for a $150 million term loan
    facility. In January 2007, the Company entered into the 2007
    Credit Agreement that provides for a $500 million term loan
    facility and $600 million in revolving facilities, which
    include both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility.
    Both credit agreements mature on January 11, 2012 and
    require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The Company
    uses the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital
    needs.

The interest rates applicable to the 2008 and 2007 Credit
    Agreements are, at the Company’s option, equal to either
    the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the
    federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or
    12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate
    margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can
    range between 33 basis points and 137.5 basis points
    for LIBOR rate loans and range between zero basis points and
    37.5 basis points for base rate loans. The 2008 and 2007
    Credit Agreements require that the Company comply with an
    interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a
    leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of
    four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the
    2008 and 2007 Credit Agreements include negative covenants that
    are customary for investment grade credit facilities. The 2008
    and 2007 Credit Agreements also contain certain customary
    representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events
    of default.

In October 2008, the Company utilized cash balances associated
    with the effective liquidation of certain foreign legal entities
    into the U.S. to voluntarily prepay the $150 million
    term loan under the 2008 Credit Agreement. The Company prepaid
    the term loan in order to reduce interest expense and there was
    no penalty for prepaying the term loan. The repayment of the
    term loan effectively terminated all lending arrangements under
    the 2008 Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company utilized
    these cash balances to voluntarily repay $340 million of
    revolving outstanding debt under the 2007 Credit Agreement. The
    Company prepaid debt in order to reduce future interest expense
    since the yield on the Company’s existing cash and
    short-term investments had recently declined significantly.
    There were no penalties for prepaying this debt.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $500 million
    borrowed under the 2007 Credit Agreement that matures in 2012.
    As of December 31, 2008, the total amount available to
    borrow under the 2007 Credit Agreement was $599 million
    after outstanding letters of credit.

In February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of
    its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During 2008
    and 2007, the Company repurchased a total of 6.9 million
    shares at a cost of $402 million under this program,
    leaving $98 million authorized for future repurchases. The
    Company repurchased 4.1 million, 3.4 million and
    5.8 million shares at a cost of $235 million,
    $201 million and $249 million during 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively, under the February 2007 authorization and
    previously announced programs. In February 2009, the
    Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
    repurchase up to an additional $500 million of its
    outstanding common stock over a two-year period.

The Company received $29 million, $91 million and
    $40 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options
    and the purchase of shares pursuant to employee stock purchase
    plan in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Proceeds from stock
    option exercises were higher in 2007 compared to 2008 and 2006
    and are believed to be attributable to the change in the
    Company’s stock price and the expiration of stock option
    grants.

The Company believes that the cash and cash equivalent balance
    of $429 million as of December 31, 2008 and expected
    cash flow from operating activities, together with borrowing
    capacity from committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to
    fund working capital, capital spending requirements, authorized
    share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse
    final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next
    twelve months. Management believes, as of the date of this
    report, that its financial position, along with expected future
    cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the
    ability to raise funds from external sources, will be sufficient
    to meet future operating and investing needs for the foreseeable
    future.

The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days
    or less, in commercial paper rated A1 or A1+ by
    Standard & Poors and P1 by Moody’s Investors
    Service, bank deposits, repurchase agreements,
    U.S. Government Treasury Bills and AAA rated
    U.S. Treasury Bill and European government bond money
    market funds. Similar investments with longer maturities are
    classified as short-term investments. Cash equivalents and
    short-term investments are convertible to a known amount of cash
    and carry



an insignificant risk of change in market value. The Company
    maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of
    federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in
    currencies other than U.S. dollars.

The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are,
    at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate
    (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate
    plus


/


%)
    or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in
    each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the
    Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between
    33 basis points and 72.5 basis points. At current and
    long-term debt levels and interest rates consistent with those
    at December 31, 2008, the Company’s interest expense
    would be approximately $13 million annually, which is not
    disclosed in the above table.

(2)

Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of
    business.

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third
    parties which expire at various dates through 2009. Fees paid
    for licenses were less than $1 million each in 2008, 2007
    and 2006. Future minimum license fees payable under existing
    license agreements as of December 31, 2008 are immaterial.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
    in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
    business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
    its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
    individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.
    Current litigation is described in Item 3, Legal
    Proceedings, of Part I of this

Form 10-K.

The Company has long-term liabilities for deferred employee
    compensation, including pension and supplemental executive
    retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental
    retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent
    upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether
    the employee elects lump-sum or annuity payments. During fiscal
    year 2009, the Company expects to contribute approximately
    $7 million to $11 million to the Company’s
    defined benefit plans. Capital expenditures in 2009 are expected
    to be higher than in 2008 due to the construction of the new TA
    facility which is estimated to cost approximately
    $33 million in total. Capital expenditures excluding the TA
    facility are expected to be about the same in 2009 as in 2008.

FIN 48, which became effective on January 1, 2007,
    requires financial statement reporting of the expected future
    tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on
    the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full
    knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of
    the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any
    discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value
    of money. If all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits
    accrued as of December 31, 2008 were to become recognizable
    in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of
    approximately $76 million in the income tax provision. As
    of December 31, 2008, however, the Company is not able to
    estimate the portion of that total potential reduction that may
    occur within the next twelve months. As a result, this
    information is not disclosed in the above table.

The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay
    any dividends in the foreseeable future.



Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Company has not created, and is not party to, any
    special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of
    raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its
    business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the
    Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated
    financial statements. The Company has not entered into any
    transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has
    subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other
    contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material
    continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation
    under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that
    provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk
    support to the Company.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Summary

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires
    the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
    and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical
    accounting policies are those that are central to the
    presentation of the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations that require management to make estimates
    about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a
    material impact on the Company’s results of operations
    given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to
    occur from period to period or use of different estimates that
    reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an
    ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates.
    The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
    various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements that require
    estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes
    in estimates used in these and other items could potentially
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
    product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
    Partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or
    performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the
    consolidated balance sheets. Shipping and handling costs are
    included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the
    customer per the order. The Company’s products generally
    carry one year of warranty. These costs are accrued at the point
    of shipment. Once the warranty period has expired, the customer
    may purchase a service contract. Service contract billings are
    generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the
    contract term and revenue is amortized on a straight-line basis
    over the contract term. At December 31, 2008, the Company
    had current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities of
    approximately $87 million and $14 million,
    respectively.

Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
    evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
    until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
    specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted
    accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility
    is not reasonably assured. The Company’s method of revenue
    recognition for certain products requiring installation is in
    accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”)
    104, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”.
    Accordingly, revenue is recognized when all of the following
    criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
    delivery has occurred; the vendor’s fee is fixed or
    determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if
    applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with
    contractual cash holdback are specified. With respect to
    installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash
    holdback or the fair value of the installation service is
    deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized
    as a multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete.
    The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon
    a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates,
    estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged
    by third parties. The Company believes that this amount
    approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the
    installation effort.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with Statement
    of Position (“SOP”)

97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition”, as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition,



With Respect to Certain Transactions”. Software revenue is
    recognized upon shipment as typically no significant
    post-delivery obligations remain. Software upgrades are
    typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue
    recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.

Loss
    Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
    to make required payments. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
    impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
    allowances may be required. The Company does not request
    collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced
    through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit.
    The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors
    including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the
    customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends
    and the macro-economic environment. Historically, the Company
    has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns
    and allowances are estimates of future product returns related
    to current period revenue. Material differences may result in
    the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management
    made different judgments or utilized different estimates for
    sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The
    Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31,
    2008 was $292 million, net of allowances for doubtful
    accounts and sales returns of $8 million.

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
    or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis (“FIFO”). The Company estimates
    revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical
    obsolescence; historical demand; projections of future demand,
    including that in the Company’s current backlog of orders;
    and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or
    market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional write-downs may be required. The
    Company’s inventory balance at December 31, 2008 was
    $173 million, net of write-downs to net realizable value of
    $12 million.

Long-Lived
    Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles,
    long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could
    trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to,
    the following:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
    projected future operating results;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends; and,

•

significant changes or developments in strategic technological
    collaborations or legal matters which affect the Company’s
    capitalized patents, trademarks and intellectual properties,
    such as licenses.

When the Company determines that the carrying value of
    intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill may not be
    recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above
    indicators, it measures any impairment based on a projected
    discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by
    management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the
    Company’s current business model. Net intangible assets,
    long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $150 million,
    $172 million and $268 million, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2008. The Company performs annual impairment
    reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual review
    during the fourth quarter of 2008 and currently does not expect
    to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future.
    However, there can be no assurance that, at the time future
    reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be
    recorded.

Warranty

Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
    engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
    including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its
    component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is
    affected by product failure rates, material usage and service
    delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should
    actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery
    costs differ from the Company’s previous estimates,
    revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
    At December 31, 2008, the Company’s warranty liability
    was $10 million.



Income
    Taxes

As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes
    in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process
    involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure
    together with assessing changes in temporary differences
    resulting from differing treatment of items, such as
    depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and
    accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
    assets and liabilities, which are included within the
    consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results
    differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these
    estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish
    an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact
    its financial position and results of operations.

SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”,
    requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of
    establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax
    assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that
    actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future
    periods. In addition, the Company adopted FIN 48 as of
    January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires financial statement
    reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain
    tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all
    relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax
    reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the
    related tax effects for the time value of money. The
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
    2008 were $77 million.

Litigation

As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I
    of this

Form 10-K,

the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters.
    With respect to each pending claim, management determines
    whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable
    and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when
    management has determined, with respect to a particular claim,
    both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate
    the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to
    either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in
    that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose
    additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to
    considerable interpretation.

With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management
    of the Company to date has been able to make this determination
    and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims
    described in Item 3. As developments occur in these matters
    and additional information becomes available, management of the
    Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their
    range, which may result in its recording charges or additional
    charges which could materially impact the Company’s results
    of operation or financial position.

Pension
    and Other Retirement Benefits

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
    and the fair values of plan assets for the Company’s
    pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated
    periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on
    relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the
    discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated
    and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.00% for its
    Waters Retirement Plan, which is the majority of the
    Company’s benefit obligation and expense.

At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount
    rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined
    the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and
    Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments
    and the Moody’s Aa interest rate as of December 31,
    2008 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash
    flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once
    the interest rates were determined, the plan’s cash flow
    was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement
    date. At December 31, 2008, the Company determined this
    rate to be 6.38% for the Waters Retirement Plan, which is the
    majority of the Company’s 2008 benefit obligation and 2009
    expense. Retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as
    those used by the Company’s defined benefit pension plan in
    accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
    other than Pensions.”

A one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate
    would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for
    the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A
    one-quarter percentage point increase in the



assumed long-term rate of return would decrease the
    Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters
    Retirement Plan by less than $1 million.

Stock-based
    Compensation

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1,
    2006. This standard requires that all share-based payments to
    employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on
    their fair values. The Company has used the Black-Scholes model
    to determine the fair value of its stock option awards. Under
    the fair-value recognition provisions of this statement,
    share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
    over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of
    share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment,
    including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock
    option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ
    significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation
    expense and the Company’s results of operations could be
    materially impacted. As stock-based compensation expense
    recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based
    on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of
    expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
    Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If
    factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in
    the application of SFAS No. 123(R), the compensation
    expense that the Company records in the future periods may
    differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the
    current period.

The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method
    permitted under SFAS No. 123(R) and, consequently, has
    not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified
    transition method, compensation costs now include expense
    relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to
    December 31, 2005 and the expense related to any awards
    issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The Company
    recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution
    method.

As of December 31, 2008, unrecognized compensation costs
    and related weighted-average lives over which the costs will be
    amortized were as follows (in millions):

Recent
    Accounting Standards Changes

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115”, which is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. This standard permits an
    entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value at specified election dates.
    Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
    fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings.
    The Company did not elect to re-measure any of its existing
    financial assets or liabilities under the provisions of this
    standard.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations”, which replaces
    SFAS No. 141. This revised standard requires assets,
    liabilities and non-controlling interests acquired to be
    measured at fair value and requires that costs incurred to
    effect the acquisition be recognized separately from the
    business combination. In addition, this statement expands the
    scope to include all transactions and other events in which one
    entity obtains control over one or more businesses. This
    statement is effective for all business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008.

SFAS No. 141(R) will be applied prospectively to
    business combinations with acquisition dates on or after
    January 1, 2009. Adoption is not expected to materially
    impact the Company’s consolidated financial position or



results of operations directly when it becomes effective, as the
    only impact that the standard will have on recorded amounts at
    that time relates to disposition of uncertain tax positions
    related to prior acquisitions. Following adoption, the
    resolution of such items at values that differ from recorded
    amounts will be adjusted through earnings rather than through
    goodwill. Adoption of this statement is, however, expected to
    have a significant effect on how acquisition transactions
    subsequent to January 1, 2009 are reflected in the
    financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51”. This
    statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement is effective for
    fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
    Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows when it becomes effective,
    but may affect the accounting for non-controlling (or minority)
    interests from that date forward.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities”. This statement is intended to help investors
    better understand how derivative instruments and hedging
    activities affect an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance and cash flows through enhanced disclosure
    requirements. This statement is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
    after November 15, 2008. The Company is in the process of
    evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a
    material effect on its financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets”. This FSP amends the factors that should be
    considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used
    to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset
    under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”. The objective of this FSP is to improve
    the consistency between the useful life of a recognized
    intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of
    expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset
    under SFAS No. 141(R) and other U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). This FSP
    applies to all intangible assets, whether acquired in a business
    combination or otherwise, and shall be effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal
    years and shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets
    acquired after the effective date. Early adoption is prohibited.
    The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption
    of this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”.
    This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles
    and the framework for selecting the principles used in the
    preparation of financial statements of non-governmental entities
    that are presented in accordance with GAAP. With the issuance of
    this statement, the FASB concluded that the GAAP hierarchy
    should be directed toward the entity and not its auditor, and
    reside in the accounting literature established by the FASB as
    opposed to the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants Statement on Auditing Standards No. 69,
    “The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles”. This statement is
    effective 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to
    U.S. Auditing Standards Section 411, “The Meaning
    of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles”. The Company is in the process of
    evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a
    material effect on its financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 132(R)-1,
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit
    Plan Assets”. This FSP amends the standard to provide
    guidance on employers’ disclosures about plan assets of a
    defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    ending after December 15, 2009. The provisions of this FSP
    are not required for earlier periods presented and early
    adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of
    evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a
    material effect on its financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates and interest rates. The Company



attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial
    instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with
    the Company’s overall risk management guidelines.

The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange-rate risk
    with respect to certain inter-company balances, forecasted
    transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro,
    Japanese Yen and British Pound. The Company manages its foreign
    currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the
    Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account
    offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the
    Company utilizes derivative and non-derivative financial
    instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency
    fluctuations.

The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and
    cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
    interest rates. The Company’s policy is to manage interest
    costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that
    management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix
    in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered
    into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to
    exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed
    and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an
    agreed upon notional amount.

Hedge
    Transactions

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended, which
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
    instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
    in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives,
    whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required
    to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value
    as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated
    as a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged
    risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated
    as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the
    fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive
    income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item
    affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value
    are recognized in earnings.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage
    exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The
    Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to
    minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most
    effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign
    currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and
    links all derivatives designated as fair-value, cash flow or net
    investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
    consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted
    transactions. The Company also assesses and documents, both at
    the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
    effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows
    associated with the hedged items.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
    to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
    related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In
    August 2007, the Company entered into two floating-to-fixed-rate
    interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of
    $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October
    2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan
    facility of its outstanding debt. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded a
    cumulative net pre-tax unrealized loss of $2 million and
    $1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    respectively, on these interest rate swap agreements.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a
    floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swap, with a notional
    amount of $200 million and maturity date of June 2007, to
    hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of
    its outstanding debt. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    the Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax realized gain of
    $1 million and, in December 2006, the Company closed out
    the swap, resulting in a pre-tax gain of less than
    $1 million. The gain was deferred and was recognized in
    earnings in 2007 over the original term of the interest rate
    swap.

Hedges of
    Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
    throughout the world, with approximately 35% of its sales
    denominated in Euros, 10% in Japanese Yen and smaller sales
    exposures in other currencies in 2008. As a



result, the Company’s financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses cross-currency
    interest rate swaps, forward contracts and range forward
    contracts to hedge its stockholders’ equity balance from
    the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These
    agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net
    investment in foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in
    the fair value of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements,
    forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the
    change in the value of the hedged net assets of the
    Company’s consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these
    derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective
    hedge of certain foreign net assets of the Company.

During 2007 and 2006, the Company hedged its net investment in
    Euro foreign affiliates with cross-currency interest rate swaps,
    with notional values ranging from $30 million to
    $100 million. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had no outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps
    contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
    $10 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    which consists of realized losses of $10 million. At
    December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the outstanding
    contracts totaled $100 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax losses of $11 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of
    $10 million and unrealized losses of $1 million.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
    principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain inter-company balances. Principal hedged currencies
    primarily include the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and
    Singapore Dollar. The periods of these forward contracts
    typically range from one to three months and have varying
    notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with
    changes in inter-company balances. Gains and losses on these
    forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative
    expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company held forward
    foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling
    approximately $120 million, $101 million and
    $71 million, respectively. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax losses of $23 million, which consists of realized losses
    of $22 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $2 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $4 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward
    contracts.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end
    exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the
    fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008 would decrease earnings by approximately
    $12 million.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations
    from the investments of cash generated from operations. The
    Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days
    or less, in commercial paper rated A1 or A1+ by
    Standard & Poors and P1 by Moody’s Investors
    Service, bank deposits, repurchase agreements,
    U.S. Government Treasury Bills and AAA rated
    U.S. Treasury Bill and European government bond money
    market funds. Similar investments with longer maturities are
    classified as short-term investments. Cash equivalents and
    short-term investments are convertible to a known amount of cash
    and carry an insignificant risk of change in market value. The
    Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in
    excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary
    accounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company has no holdings in auction
    rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured
    investment vehicles, collateralized debt obligation conduits or
    asset-backed conduits.

The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk
    due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of
    December 31, 2008, the carrying value of the Company’s
    cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value.

    Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
    detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

, our management,
    including our chief executive officer and chief financial
    officer, concluded that our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
    herein.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and of cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Notes 10, 14 and 17 to the consolidated
    financial statements, respectively, the Company changed the
    manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions
    effective January 1, 2007, share-based compensation
    effective January 1, 2006 and defined benefit pension and
    other postretirement plans effective December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Description
    of Business, Organization and Basis of Presentation

Waters Corporation (“Waters” or the
    “Company”), an analytical instrument manufacturer,
    designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters
    Division, high performance liquid chromatography
    (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid
    chromatography

®

(“UPLC” and together with HPLC, herein referred to as
    “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”)
    instrument systems and support products, including
    chromatography columns, other consumable products and
    comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are
    complementary products that can be integrated together and used
    along with other analytical instruments. LC is a standard
    technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to
    detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and
    biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range
    of compounds. MS instruments are used in drug discovery and
    development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of
    proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”)
    and environmental testing. LC is often combined with MS to
    create LC-MS instruments that include a liquid phase sample
    introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric
    compound identification and quantification. Through its TA
    Division (“TA”), the Company designs, manufactures,
    sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry
    instruments which are used primarily in predicting the
    suitability of polymers and liquids for various industrial,
    consumer goods and healthcare products as well as for life
    science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier
    of software-based products that interface with the
    Company’s instruments and are typically purchased by
    customers as part of the instrument system.


Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and
    judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company
    evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
    recognition, product returns and allowances, bad debts,
    inventory valuation, equity investments, goodwill and intangible
    assets, warranty and installation provisions, income taxes,
    contingencies, litigation, retirement plan obligations and
    stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on
    historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
    believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
    of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Risks and
    Uncertainties

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the
    analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to,
    global economic and credit conditions, development by its
    competitors of new technological innovations, risk of
    disruption, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
    dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of
    proprietary technology, compliance with regulations of the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign
    regulatory authorities and agencies and changes in the fair
    value of the underlying assets of the Company’s defined
    benefit plans.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified in the
    accompanying financial statements in order to be consistent with
    the current year’s classifications.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly
    owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or
    controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All
    material inter-company balances and transactions have been
    eliminated.

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and
    liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange
    rates prevailing on the balance sheet date while revenues and
    expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

during the period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
    consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s net sales
    derived from operations outside the United States were 70% in
    2008, 68% in 2007 and 68% in 2006. Gains and losses from foreign
    currency transactions are included in net income in the
    consolidated statements of operations and were not material for
    the years presented.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents primarily represent highly liquid investments,
    with original maturities of generally 90 days or less, in
    commercial paper rated A1 or A1+ by Standard &
    Poor’s and P1 by Moody’s Investors Service, bank
    deposits, repurchase agreements, U.S. Government Treasury
    Bills and AAA rated U.S. Treasury Bill and European
    government bond money market funds which are convertible to a
    known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change
    in market value. Similar investments with longer maturities are
    classified as short-term investments. The Company maintains
    balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally
    insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies
    other than U.S. dollars.

Short-Term
    Investments

Short-term investments were classified as available-for-sale in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”. All
    available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair market value
    and any unrealized holding gains and losses, to the extent
    deemed temporary, are included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity, net of the
    related tax effects. Realized gains and losses are determined on
    the specific identification method and are included in other
    income (expense) net. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a
    decline in the value of the investment, the Company considers
    all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the
    decline is “other than temporary” and marks the
    investment to market through a charge to the statement of
    operations. The Company classifies its investments as short-term
    investments exclusive of those categorized as cash equivalents.
    At December 31, 2007, the Company had short-term
    investments with a cost of $96 million, which approximated
    market value. The Company had no short-term investments as of
    December 31, 2008.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products and services to a significant
    number of large and small customers throughout the world, with
    net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately 50% in
    2008, 52% in 2007 and 52% in 2006. None of the Company’s
    individual customers accounted for more than 3% of annual
    Company sales in 2008, 2007 or 2006. The Company performs
    continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
    does not require collateral, but in certain circumstances may
    require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company
    has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

Seasonality
    of Business

The Company experiences an increase in sales in the fourth
    quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of
    customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by
    calendar year end.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
    the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the
    existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number
    of factors, including historical experience and the
    customer’s credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful
    accounts is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. Past due
    balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are
    reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are
    charged against the allowance when the Company feels it is
    probable that the receivable will not be recovered. The Company
    does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to
    its customers.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s
    allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands):

Inventory

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
    or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis (“FIFO”).

Income
    Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences
    between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets
    and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which
    the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance
    is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon
    the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or
    all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A liability
    has also been recorded to recognize uncertain tax return
    reporting positions.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures
    for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense while the
    costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation
    is provided using the straight-line method over the following
    estimated useful lives: buildings — fifteen to thirty
    years; building improvements — five to ten years;
    leasehold improvements — the shorter of the economic
    useful life or life of lease; and production and other
    equipment — three to ten years. Upon retirement or
    sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related
    accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated
    balance sheets and related gains or losses are reflected in the
    consolidated statements of operations. There were no material
    gains or losses from retirement or sale of assets in 2008, 2007
    and 2006.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests for goodwill impairment using a fair-value
    approach at the reporting unit level annually, or earlier, if an
    event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
    not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
    amount. Additionally, the Company has elected to make January 1
    the annual impairment assessment date for its reporting units.
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets”, defines a reporting unit as an operating segment,
    or one level below an operating segment, if discrete financial
    information is prepared and reviewed by management. Goodwill is
    allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition.
    Under the impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying
    amount exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is
    recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill
    exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value
    of reporting units was estimated using a discounted cash flows
    technique, which includes certain management assumptions, such
    as estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and
    discount rates.

The Company’s intangible assets include purchased
    technology; capitalized software development costs; costs
    associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and
    intellectual properties, such as licenses; and debt issuance
    costs. Purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market
    values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their
    estimated useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years. Other
    intangibles are amortized over a period ranging from one to
    thirteen years. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life
    of the related debt.

Software
    Development Costs

The Company capitalizes software development costs for products
    offered for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 86,
    “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
    Leased, or Otherwise Marketed”. Capitalized costs are



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amortized to cost of sales over the period of economic benefit,
    which approximates a straight-line basis over the estimated
    useful lives of the related software products, generally three
    to five years.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs in
    accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”)

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”. Capitalized internal software
    development costs are amortized over the period of economic
    benefit which approximates a straight-line basis over ten years.
    At December 31, 2008 and 2007, capitalized internal
    software included in property, plant and equipment totaled
    $2 million each, net of accumulated amortization of
    $5 million and $4 million, respectively.

Investments

The Company accounts for its investments that represent less
    than twenty percent ownership using SFAS No. 115.
    Investments for which the Company does not have the ability to
    exercise significant influence and for which there is not a
    readily determinable market value are accounted for under the
    cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates
    the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the
    cost method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost
    or estimated net realizable value. For investments in which the
    Company owns or controls between twenty and forty-nine percent
    of the voting shares, or over which it exerts significant
    influence over operating and financial policies, the equity
    method of accounting is used. The Company’s share of net
    income or losses of equity investments is included in the
    consolidated statements of operations and was not material in
    any period presented.

All investments at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are included
    in other assets and amounted to $7 million and
    $8 million, respectively. See Note 6, “Business
    Investments”, for net other-than-temporary impairment
    charges taken in 2006 for certain equity investments.

Asset
    Impairments

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Whenever
    events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
    asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the fair
    value of the asset, relying on a number of factors, including,
    but not limited to, operating results, business plans, economic
    projections and anticipated future cash flows. Any change in the
    carrying amount of an asset as a result of the Company’s
    evaluation is separately identified in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Fair
    Values of Financial Instruments

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”.
    This standard addresses how companies should measure fair value
    when they are required to use a fair-value measure for
    recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP. The adoption of
    this standard did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. Relative to SFAS No. 157, the FASB issued FASB
    Staff Position (“FSP”) Nos.

157-1,

157-2

and

157-3.

FSP

No. 157-1

amends SFAS No. 157 to exclude SFAS No. 13,
    “Accounting for Leases”, and its related interpretive
    accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions,
    while FSP

No. 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for
    those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis. As is permitted by
    FSP

No. 157-2,

the Company has elected to defer implementation of this standard
    as it relates to the Company’s non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at
    fair value in the financial statements on a non-recurring basis
    until January 1, 2009. The Company is in the process of
    evaluating whether the adoption of FSP

No. 157-2

will have a material effect on its financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows. FSP

No. 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 as it
    relates to the valuation of financial assets in a market that is
    not active for those financial assets. This FSP is effective
    immediately and includes those periods for which financial
    statements have not been issued. As of December 31, 2008,
    the Company currently does not have any financial assets that
    are valued using inactive markets, and, as such are not
    currently impacted by the issuance of this FSP.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-level value hierarchy
    for disclosure of fair-value measurements. The valuation
    hierarchy is based on the transparency of the inputs to the
    valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
    The three levels are defined as follows:

Level 1 — Inputs to the valuation methodology are
    quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities
    in active markets.

Level 2 — Inputs to the valuation methodology are
    quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
    markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs
    that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
    or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
    instrument.

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs (e.g. a reporting
    entity’s own data).

In accordance with methodology prescribed by
    SFAS No. 157, the Company has measured and disclosed
    the fair value of the following financial instrument assets and
    liabilities as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands):

Stockholders’
    Equity

In February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of
    its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During 2008
    and 2007, the Company repurchased a total of 6.9 million
    shares at a cost of $402 million under this program,
    leaving $98 million authorized for future purchases. The
    Company repurchased 4.1 million, 3.4 million and
    5.8 million shares at a cost of $235 million,
    $201 million and $249 million during 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively, under the February 2007 authorization and
    previously announced programs. In February 2009, the
    Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
    repurchase up to an additional $500 million of its
    outstanding common stock over a two-year period. The Company
    believes it has the resources to fund the common stock
    repurchases as well as to pursue acquisition opportunities in
    the future.

On August 9, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the
    adoption of a stock purchase rights plan where a dividend of one
    fractional preferred share purchase right (a “Right”)
    was declared for each outstanding share of common stock, par
    value $0.01 per share, of the Company. The dividend was paid on
    August 27, 2002 to the stockholders of record on that date.
    The Rights, which expire on August 27, 2012, become
    exercisable only under certain conditions. When they first
    become exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to buy
    from Waters one one-hundredth of a share of new Series A
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock (authorized limit of 4,000)
    for $120.00. When a person or group actually has acquired 15% or
    more of Waters’ common stock, the Rights will then become
    exercisable for a number of shares of Waters’ common stock
    with a market value of twice the $120.00 exercise price of each
    Right. In addition, the Rights will then become exercisable for
    a number of shares of common



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

stock of the acquiring company with a market value of twice the
    $120.00 exercise price per Right. The Board of Directors may
    redeem the Rights at a price of $0.001 per Right up until
    10 days following a public announcement that any person or
    group has acquired 15% or more of the Company’s common
    stock.

Hedge
    Transactions

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended, which
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
    instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
    in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives,
    whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required
    to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value
    as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated
    as a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged
    risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated
    as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the
    fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive
    income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item
    affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value
    are recognized in earnings.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage
    exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The
    Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to
    minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most
    effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign
    currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and
    links all derivatives designated as fair-value, cash flow or net
    investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
    consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted
    transactions. The Company also assesses and documents, both at
    the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
    effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows
    associated with the hedged items.

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates and interest rates.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
    to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
    related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In
    August 2007, the Company entered into two floating-to-fixed-rate
    interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of
    $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October
    2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan
    facility of its outstanding debt. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded a
    cumulative net pre-tax unrealized loss of $2 million and
    $1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    respectively, on these interest rate swap agreements.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a
    floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swap, with a notional
    amount of $200 million and maturity date of June 2007, to
    hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of
    its outstanding debt. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    the Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax realized gain of
    $1 million and, in December 2006, the Company closed out
    the swap, resulting in a pre-tax gain of less than
    $1 million. The gain was deferred and was recognized in
    earnings in 2007 over the original term of the interest rate
    swap.

Hedges of
    Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
    throughout the world, with approximately 35% of its sales
    denominated in Euros, 10% in Japanese Yen and smaller sales
    exposures in other currencies in 2008. As a result, the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates. The Company uses cross-currency interest rate
    swaps, forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge
    its stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are
    designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in
    foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value
    of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements, forward
    contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in
    the value of the hedged net assets of the Company’s
    consolidated foreign



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

affiliates. Therefore, these derivative instruments are intended
    to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of
    the Company.

During 2007 and 2006, the Company hedged its net investment in
    Euro foreign affiliates with cross-currency interest rate swaps,
    with notional values ranging from $30 million to
    $100 million. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had no outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps
    contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
    $10 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    which consists of realized losses of $10 million. At
    December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the outstanding
    contracts totaled $100 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax losses of $11 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of
    $10 million and unrealized losses of $1 million.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
    principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain inter-company balances. Principal hedged currencies
    primarily include the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and
    Singapore Dollar. The periods of these forward contracts
    typically range from one to three months and have varying
    notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with
    changes in inter-company balances. Gains and losses on these
    forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative
    expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company held forward
    foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling
    approximately $120 million, $101 million and
    $71 million, respectively. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax losses of $23 million, which consists of realized
    losses of $22 million relating to the closed forward
    contracts and $1 million of unrealized losses relating to
    the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $2 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $4 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward
    contracts.

Revenue
    Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
    product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
    Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
    evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
    until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
    specifying fixed terms and prices. Proceeds received in advance
    of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as
    deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Shipping
    and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts
    invoiced to the customer per the order.

The Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain
    products requiring installation is in accordance with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, “Revenue
    Recognition in Financial Statements”. Accordingly, revenue
    is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
    occurred; the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable;
    collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon
    acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash
    holdback are specified. With respect to installation
    obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the
    fair value of the installation service is deferred when the
    product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a
    multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete. The
    Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a
    number of factors, including hourly service billing rates,
    estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged
    by third parties.

The Company recognizes product revenue when legal title has
    transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company
    structures its sales arrangements as FOB shipping point or
    international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue
    upon shipment. In some cases, FOB destination based shipping
    terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue
    is recognized when the products arrive at the customer site.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales
    arrangements. Revenue associated with products that contain
    specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized before
    the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. Discounts from
    list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with

SOP 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition”, as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions”. Software revenue is recognized upon shipment
    as typically no significant post-delivery obligations remain.
    Software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service
    contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the
    service contract.

The Company assists customers in obtaining financing with an
    independent third-party leasing company with respect to certain
    product sales. Revenue is generally recognized upon product
    shipment under these arrangements. The Company receives payment
    from the leasing company shortly after shipment, provided
    delivery and credit documentation meets contractual criteria.
    The customer is obligated to pay the leasing company but the
    Company retains some credit risk if the customer is unable to
    pay. Accordingly, the Company reduces revenue equal to
    pre-established loss-pool criteria, including contracts with
    recourse. The Company’s credit risk is significantly
    reduced through loss-pool limitations and re-marketing rights in
    the event of a default.

Product
    Warranty Costs

The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time
    of sale which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated
    statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive
    product quality programs and processes, including actively
    monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies,
    the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product
    failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs
    incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the
    accrued warranty liability is based on historical information,
    such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units
    repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The
    liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s
    accrued warranty liability for the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands):

    statements of operations. Advertising expenses for 2008, 2007
    and 2006 were $9 million, $6 million and
    $8 million, respectively.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised of costs
    incurred in performing research and development activities,
    including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead
    costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and
    development expenses are expensed as incurred.

Stock-Based

Earnings
    Per Share

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per
    Share”, the Company presents two earnings per share
    (“EPS”) amounts. Income per basic common share is
    based on income available to common shareholders and the
    weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
    periods presented. Income per diluted common share includes
    additional dilution from potential common stock, such as stock
    issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding.

Comprehensive
    Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with
    SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive
    Income”. The statement establishes standards for reporting
    and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full
    set of general-purpose financial statements. The statement
    requires that all components of comprehensive income be reported
    in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
    prominence as other financial statements.

Recent
    Accounting Standards Changes

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115”, which is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. This standard permits an
    entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value at specified election dates.
    Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
    fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings.
    The Company did not elect to re-measure any of its existing
    financial assets or liabilities under the provisions of this
    standard.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations”, which replaces
    SFAS No. 141. This revised standard requires assets,
    liabilities and non-controlling interests acquired to be
    measured at fair value and requires that costs incurred to
    effect the acquisition be recognized separately from the
    business combination. In addition, this statement expands the
    scope to include all transactions and other events in which one
    entity obtains control over one or more businesses. This
    statement is effective for all business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008.

SFAS No. 141(R) will be applied prospectively to
    business combinations with acquisition dates on or after
    January 1, 2009. Adoption is not expected to materially
    impact the Company’s consolidated financial position or
    results of operations directly when it becomes effective, as the
    only impact that the standard will have on recorded amounts at
    that time relates to disposition of uncertain tax positions
    related to prior acquisitions. Following adoption, the
    resolution of such items at values that differ from recorded
    amounts will be adjusted through earnings rather than through
    goodwill. Adoption of this statement is, however, expected to
    have a significant effect on how acquisition transactions
    subsequent to January 1, 2009 are reflected in the
    financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51”. This
    statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement is effective for
    fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
    Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows when it becomes effective,
    but may affect the accounting for non-controlling (or minority)
    interests from that date forward.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities”. This statement is intended to help investors
    better understand how derivative instruments and hedging
    activities affect an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance and cash flows through enhanced disclosure
    requirements. This statement is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
    after November 15, 2008. The Company is in the process of
    evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a
    material effect on its financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets”. This FSP amends the factors that should be
    considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used
    to



NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142. The objective of this FSP is to improve
    the consistency between the useful life of a recognized
    intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of
    expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset
    under SFAS No. 141(R) and other U.S. GAAP. This
    FSP applies to all intangible assets, whether acquired in a
    business combination or otherwise, and shall be effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal
    years and shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets
    acquired after the effective date. Early adoption is prohibited.
    The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption
    of this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”.
    This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles
    and the framework for selecting the principles used in the
    preparation of financial statements of non-governmental entities
    that are presented in accordance with GAAP. With the issuance of
    this statement, the FASB concluded that the GAAP hierarchy
    should be directed toward the entity and not its auditor, and
    reside in the accounting literature established by the FASB as
    opposed to the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants Statement on Auditing Standards No. 69,
    “The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles”. This statement is
    effective 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to
    U.S. Auditing Standards Section 411, “The Meaning
    of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles”. The Company is in the process of
    evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a
    material effect on its financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 132(R)-1,
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit
    Plan Assets”. This FSP amends the standard to provide
    guidance on employers’ disclosures about plan assets of a
    defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    ending after December 15, 2009. The provisions of this FSP
    are not required for earlier periods presented and early
    adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of
    evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a
    material effect on its financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

3  Out-of-Period
    Adjustments

During the second quarter of 2008, the Company identified errors
    originating in periods prior to the three months ended
    June 28, 2008. The errors primarily related to (i) an
    overstatement of the Company’s income tax expense of
    $16 million as a result of errors in recording its income
    tax provision during the period from 2000 to March 29, 2008
    and (ii) an understatement of amortization expense of
    $9 million for certain capitalized software. The Company
    incorrectly calculated its provision for income taxes by
    tax-effecting its tax liability utilizing a U.S. tax rate
    of 35% instead of an Irish tax rate of 10%. In addition, the
    Company incorrectly accounted for Irish-based capitalized
    software and the related amortization expense as
    U.S. Dollar-denominated instead of Euro-denominated,
    resulting in an understatement of amortization expense and
    cumulative translation adjustment.

The Company identified and corrected the errors in the three
    months ended June 28, 2008, which had the effect of
    increasing cost of sales by $9 million; reducing gross
    profit and income from operations before income tax by
    $9 million; reducing the provision for income taxes by
    $16 million and increasing net income by $8 million.
    For the year ended December 31, 2008, the errors had the
    effect of reducing the Company’s effective tax rate by
    4.0 percentage points. In addition, as of June 28,
    2008, the out-of-period adjustments increased the gross carrying
    value of capitalized software by $46 million; increased
    accumulated amortization for capitalized software by
    $36 million; reduced deferred tax liabilities by
    $14 million and increased accumulated other comprehensive
    income by $17 million.

The Company does not believe that the prior period errors,
    individually or in the aggregate, are material to any previously
    issued annual or quarterly financial statements. In addition,
    the Company does not believe that the adjustments described
    above to correct the cumulative effect of the errors in the
    three months ended June 28, 2008 are material to the three
    months ended June 28, 2008 or to the full year results for
    2008. As a result, the Company has not restated its previously
    issued annual financial statements or interim financial data.

6  Business
    Investments

In June 2007, the Company made an equity investment in Thar
    Instruments, Inc. (“Thar”), a privately held global
    leader in the design, development and manufacture of analytical
    and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and
    supercritical fluid extraction systems, for $4 million in
    cash. This investment is accounted for under the cost method of
    accounting. On February 2, 2009, the Company acquired all
    of the remaining outstanding capital stock of Thar for
    $36 million, including the assumption of $4 million of
    debt.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
    $6 million charge for an other-than-temporary impairment to
    an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
    (“Caprion”). The charge was recorded in 2006 when the
    Company was notified that Caprion’s financial condition had
    deteriorated and that a merger was occurring that, in the
    Company’s assessment, would result in the Company’s
    investment being substantially diminished. In March 2007,
    Caprion merged with Ecopia BioSciences Inc. and is now named
    Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Thallion”). Thallion
    is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the
    Company’s investment is accounted for under
    SFAS No. 115. The market value of the Thallion
    investment was less than $1 million at both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007.

7  Acquisitions

In December 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of
    Analytical Products Group, Inc. (“APG”), a provider of
    environmental testing products for quality control and
    proficiency testing used in environmental laboratories, for
    $5 million in cash. This acquisition was accounted for
    under the purchase method of accounting and the results of APG
    have been included in the consolidated results of the Company
    from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition
    was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed
    liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The Company
    has allocated $3 million of the purchase price to
    intangible assets comprised of non-compete

agreements, acquired technology, customer relationships and
    tradename. These intangible assets are being amortized over a
    weighted-average period of ten years. The excess purchase price
    of $1 million after this allocation has been accounted for
    as goodwill. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

In July 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of VTI
    Corporation (“VTI”), a manufacturer of sorption
    analysis and thermogravimetric analysis instruments, for
    $3 million in cash. This acquisition was accounted for
    under the purchase method of accounting and the results of VTI
    have been included in the consolidated results of the Company
    from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition
    was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed
    liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The Company
    has allocated $1 million of the purchase price to
    intangible assets comprised of a non-compete agreement and
    acquired technology. These intangible assets are being amortized
    over a weighted-average period of nine years. The excess
    purchase price of $2 million after this allocation has been
    accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is deductible for tax
    purposes.

In October 2007, the Company acquired certain net assets and
    customer lists from a South Korean distributor of thermal
    analysis products for a total of $2 million in cash. The
    Company has allocated $2 million of the purchase price to
    intangible assets comprised of customer relationships and
    non-compete agreements. These intangible assets are being
    amortized over a weighted-average period of ten years.

In August 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Calorimetry Sciences Corporation
    (“CSC”), a privately held company that designs,
    develops and manufactures highly sensitive calorimeters, for
    $7 million in cash, including the assumption of
    $1 million of liabilities. This acquisition was accounted
    for under the purchase method of accounting and the results of
    operations of CSC have been included in the consolidated results
    of the Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of
    the acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets
    and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values.
    The Company has allocated $3 million of the purchase price
    to intangible assets comprised of customer relationships,
    non-compete agreements and acquired technology. These intangible
    assets are being amortized over a weighted-average period of
    nine years. The excess purchase price of $5 million after
    this allocation has been accounted for as goodwill. The sellers
    also have provided the Company with normal representations,
    warranties and indemnification which would be settled in the
    future if and when the contractual representation or warranty
    condition occurs. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

In December 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Environmental Resources Associates, Inc.
    (“ERA”), a provider of environmental testing products
    for quality control, proficiency testing and specialty
    calibration chemicals used in environmental laboratories, for
    $62 million, including the assumption of $4 million of
    debt. This acquisition was accounted for under the purchase
    method of accounting and the results of operations of ERA have
    been included in the consolidated results of the Company from
    the acquisition date.

In August 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Thermometric AB (“Thermometric”), a
    manufacturer of high performance micro-calorimeters, and certain
    net assets and customer lists from a Taiwan distributor of
    thermal analysis products for a total of $3 million in
    cash. As part of the Thermometric acquisition, the Company
    assumed $1 million of debt. These acquisitions were
    accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the
    results of operations of these acquisitions have been included
    in the consolidated results of the Company from the acquisition
    dates.

In February 2006, the Company acquired the net assets of the
    food safety business of VICAM Limited Partnership
    (“VICAM”) for $14 million. This acquisition was
    accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the
    results of operations of VICAM have been included in the
    consolidated results of the Company from the acquisition date.

8  Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

The carrying amount of goodwill was $268 million and
    $273 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The overall decrease is primarily attributable to
    an $8 million decrease due to currency translation being
    partially offset by the $3 million of goodwill from the
    Company’s acquisitions of VTI and APG (Note 7).

The Company’s intangible assets included in the
    consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (in

The gross carrying value of capitalized software and related
    accumulated amortization increased by $46 million and
    $36 million, respectively, during the six months ended
    June 28, 2008 primarily as a result of an out-of-period
    adjustment (Note 3). During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company acquired $4 million of
    purchased intangibles as a result of the acquisitions of VTI and
    APG. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    acquired $4 million of purchased intangibles as a result of
    the acquisitions of CSC and the distributor rights from a South
    Korean distributor of thermal analysis products. In addition,
    the gross carrying value of intangible assets decreased by
    $25 million in 2008 and increased $3 million in 2007,
    respectively, due to the effect of foreign currency translation.
    The gross carrying value of accumulated amortization for
    intangible assets decreased by $17 million in 2008 and
    increased by $1 million in 2007 due to the effect of
    foreign currency translation.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    amortization expense for intangible assets was $36 million,
    $26 million and $20 million, respectively. Included in
    amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2008
    is a $9 million out-of-period adjustment related to
    capitalized software. Amortization expense for intangible assets
    is estimated to be approximately $28 million for each of
    the next five years.

9  Debt

In March 2008, the Company entered into a new credit agreement
    (the “2008 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a
    $150 million term loan facility. In January 2007, the
    Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2007 Credit
    Agreement”) that provides for a $500 million term loan
    facility and $600 million in revolving facilities, which



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

include both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility.
    Both credit agreements mature on January 11, 2012 and
    require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The
    outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been
    classified as short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance
    sheets due to the fact that the Company utilizes the revolving
    line of credit to fund its working capital needs. It is the
    Company’s intention to pay the outstanding revolving line
    of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months following
    the respective period end date.

The interest rates applicable to the 2008 and 2007 Credit
    Agreements are, at the Company’s option, equal to either
    the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the
    federal funds rate plus


/


%)
    or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in
    each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the
    Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between
    33 basis points and 137.5 basis points for LIBOR rate
    loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis
    points for base rate loans. The 2008 and 2007 Credit Agreements
    require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio
    test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not
    more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal
    quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2008 and 2007 Credit
    Agreements include negative covenants that are customary for
    investment grade credit facilities. The 2008 and 2007 Credit
    Agreements also contain certain customary representations and
    warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all
    such covenants.

In October 2008, the Company utilized cash balances associated
    with the effective liquidation of certain foreign legal entities
    into the U.S. to voluntarily prepay the $150 million
    term loan under the 2008 Credit Agreement. The Company prepaid
    the term loan in order to reduce interest expense and there was
    no penalty for prepaying the term loan. The repayment of the
    term loan effectively terminated all lending arrangements under
    the 2008 Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company utilized
    these cash balances to voluntarily repay $340 million of
    revolving outstanding debt under the 2007 Credit Agreement. The
    Company prepaid debt in order to reduce future interest expense
    since the yield on the Company’s existing cash and
    short-term investments had declined significantly. There were no
    penalties for prepaying this debt.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $500 million
    borrowed under the 2007 Credit Agreement and an amount available
    to borrow of $599 million after outstanding letters of
    credit. At December 31, 2008, $500 million of the
    total debt was classified as long-term debt in the consolidated
    balance sheets. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
    $865 million borrowed under the 2007 Credit Agreement and
    an amount available to borrow of $233 million after
    outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2007,
    $500 million of the total debt was classified as long-term
    debt and $365 million classified as short-term debt in the
    consolidated balance sheets. The weighted-average interest rates
    applicable to these borrowings were 2.43% and 5.67% at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company, and its foreign subsidiaries, also had available
    short-term lines of credit, totaling $88 million at
    December 31, 2008 and $99 million at December 31,
    2007. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, related short-term
    borrowings were $36 million at a weighted-average interest
    rate of 2.18% and $19 million at a weighted-average
    interest rate of 3.30%, respectively.

Net deferred tax assets of $30 million and $24 million
    are included in other current assets and $46 million and
    $33 million are included in other assets at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company’s deferred tax assets associated with net
    operating loss, tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum
    tax credits are comprised of the following at December 31,
    2008: $20 million ($50 million pre-tax) benefit of
    U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards
    that begin to expire in 2020 and 2009, respectively;
    $70 million in foreign tax credits, which begin to expire
    in 2009; $10 million in research and development credits
    that begin to expire in 2010; and $1 million
    ($5 million pre-tax) in foreign net operating losses,
    $1 million ($4 million pre-tax) of which do not expire
    under current law, the remainder of which begin to expire in
    2009. The Company has excluded the benefit of $13 million
    ($35 million pre-tax) of U.S. federal and state net
    operating loss carryforwards from the deferred tax asset balance
    at December 31, 2008. This amount represents an
    “excess tax benefit”, as the term is defined in
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment”,
    which will be recognized as a reduction to the Company’s
    accrued income taxes and an addition to its additional paid-in
    capital when it is realized in the Company’s tax returns.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company has provided a
    deferred tax valuation allowance of $83 million,
    principally against foreign tax credits ($70 million),
    certain foreign net operating losses and other deferred tax
    assets. The benefit relating to foreign tax credits and these
    other deferred tax assets, if realized, will be credited to
    additional paid-in capital.

The income tax benefits associated with non-qualified stock
    option compensation expense recognized for tax purposes and
    credited to additional paid-in capital were $7 million,
    $17 million and $17 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2008, there were unremitted earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1.1 billion. The
    Company has not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign
    withholding taxes on these earnings as it is the Company’s
    current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside
    the U.S.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48. FIN 48
    prescribes the methodology by which a company must measure,
    report, present and disclose in its financial statements the
    effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that a
    company has taken or expects to take. FIN 48, which became
    effective on January 1, 2007, requires financial statement
    reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain
    tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all
    relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax
    reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the
    related tax effects for the time value of money. FIN 48
    also mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about
    uncertainty in income tax reporting positions.

The Company implemented the methodology prescribed by
    FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. The Company recorded the
    effect of adopting FIN 48 with a $4 million charge to
    beginning retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet as
    of January 1, 2007. The 2008 and 2007 activity in the
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as
    follows (in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    recorded increases of $9 million and $6 million,
    respectively, in unrecognized tax benefits via the income tax
    provision. Included in the income tax provision for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 is an unrecorded tax benefit of
    $5 million that is associated with the reorganization of
    certain foreign entities in October 2008. In February 2009, the
    U.S. Treasury promulgated changes in income tax regulations
    that eliminate concerns with respect to the $5 million
    unrecognized tax benefit that was originally recorded in the
    third quarter of 2008 through the Company’s tax provision.
    Because these changes in income tax regulations were promulgated
    during the first quarter of 2009, the Company will record this
    $5 million item as a recognized tax benefit and, therefore,
    as a reduction of its income tax provision for the first quarter
    of 2009. If all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits
    accrued as of December 31, 2008 were to become recognizable
    in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of
    approximately $76 million in the income tax provision. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Company believes $5 million
    of that total potential reduction may occur within the next
    twelve months.

The Company’s accounting policy is to record estimated
    interest and penalties related to the potential underpayment of
    income taxes, net of related tax effects, as a component of the
    income tax provision. For the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, the Company included $1 million and
    $1 million ($2 million and $2 million pre-tax),
    respectively, of such interest expense, net of related tax
    benefits, and no income tax penalty expense in the income tax
    provision. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    had accrued $5 million ($8 million pre-tax) and
    $4 million ($6 million pre-tax), respectively, of such
    estimated interest expense, net of related tax benefits. As of
    both December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had accrued no
    income tax penalty expense.

The Company’s uncertain tax positions are taken with
    respect to income tax return reporting periods beginning after
    December 31, 1999, which are the periods that remain
    generally open to income tax audit examination by the various
    income tax authorities that have jurisdiction over the
    Company’s income tax reporting for that period of time. The
    Company has monitored and will continue to monitor the lapsing
    of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for
    related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits,
    related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. As of December 31, 2008, however, the Company
    does not expect to record any material changes in the
    measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest
    and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the
    lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments
    within the next twelve months.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s effective tax rates for years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were 13.4%, 17.1% and
    15.5%, respectively. The 2008 effective tax rate includes a
    $5 million tax provision associated with the reorganization
    of certain foreign legal entities. This one-time provision
    increased the Company’s effective tax rate by
    1.4 percentage points for 2008. The 2008 tax provision also
    contains out-of-period adjustments to correct errors relating to
    capitalized software amortization and the income tax provision.
    The $16 million tax benefit from the out-of-period
    adjustments reduced the Company’s effective tax rate by
    4.0 percentage points for 2008. The 2007 tax provision
    includes a $4 million tax benefit associated with a
    one-time contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan.
    The remaining decrease in the effective tax rate for 2008 as
    compared with 2007 is primarily attributable to proportionately
    greater growth in income in jurisdictions with comparatively
    lower effective tax rates. The net increase in the effective tax
    rate for 2007 as compared with 2006 is primarily attributable to
    increased net income in jurisdictions with comparatively higher
    tax rates.

11  Patent
    Litigation

The Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in
    the ordinary course of business. The Company believes the
    outcome, if the plaintiff ultimately prevails, will not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial position.

The Company has been engaged in ongoing patent litigation with
    Agilent Technologies GmbH in England, France and Germany. In
    January 2009, the French appeals court affirmed that the Company
    had infringed the Agilent Technologies GmbH patent and a
    judgment was issued against the Company. The Company has
    appealed this judgment. In the meantime, however, the Company
    has recorded a $7 million provision in 2008 for damages and
    fees estimated to be incurred in connection with this case. The
    accrued patent litigation expense is in other current
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2008. No provision has been made for the
    German patent litigation and the Company believes the outcome,
    if the plaintiff ultimately prevails, will not have a material
    impact on the Company’s financial position.

12  Restructuring
    and Other Charges

In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan,
    primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe,
    which resulted in the employment of 74 employees being
    terminated, all of which had left the Company as of
    December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company closed a sales
    and demonstration office in the Netherlands in the second
    quarter of 2006. The Company implemented this cost reduction
    plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business
    opportunities around the world. The Company incurred
    $8 million of charges in 2006 related to the February 2006
    initiative. The Company does not expect to incur any additional
    charges in connection with this cost reduction initiative. The
    Company’s restructuring liability included in other current
    liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet was less than
    $1 million at both December 31, 2008 and 2007.

13  Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Lease agreements, expiring at various dates through 2026, cover
    buildings, office equipment and automobiles. Rental expense was

In October 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to
    purchase land adjacent to its TA facility in Delaware for
    approximately $7 million. The Company plans to construct a
    new 150,000 square foot facility in 2009 that will
    consolidate TA’s existing Delaware operations and
    accommodate future expansion at a cost of approximately
    $26 million. In addition, the Company entered into a lease
    termination agreement with its existing Delaware landlord that
    requires the Company to pay a lease termination fee of
    approximately $5 million when the Company vacates the
    existing leased property. The Company expects to vacate the
    leased property in the second half of 2009 once the construction
    of the new facility is complete.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
    in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
    business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
    its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
    individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in
    its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements,
    the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse
    the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
    indemnified party, generally the Company’s business
    partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or
    other intellectual property infringement claims by any third
    party with respect to its current products, as well as claims
    relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from
    the performance of services by the Company or its
    subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments
    the Company could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the
    Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
    relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and
    management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of
    these agreements is immaterial.

14  Stock-Based
    Compensation

In May 2003, the Company’s shareholders approved the
    Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (“2003
    Plan”). As of December 31, 2008, the 2003 Plan has
    3.9 million shares available for granting in the form of
    incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
    rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock
    units or other types of awards. The Company issues new shares of
    common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock
    unit conversion. Under the 2003 Plan, the exercise price for
    stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the
    underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2003 Plan is
    scheduled to terminate on March 4, 2013. Options generally
    will expire no later than 10 years after the date on which
    they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally
    vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR
    may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other
    award. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units may
    be issued under the 2003 Plan for such consideration as is
    determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. No award of restricted stock may have a restriction
    period of less than three years except as may be recommended by
    the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or with
    respect to any award of restricted stock which provides solely
    for a performance-based risk of forfeiture so long as such award
    has a restriction period of at least one year. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had stock options,
    restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards outstanding.

In February 1996, the Company adopted its 1996 Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan under which eligible employees may contribute up
    to 15% of their earnings toward the quarterly purchase of the
    Company’s common stock. The plan makes available
    1.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock
    commencing October 1, 1996. As of December 31, 2008,
    0.9 million shares have been issued under the plan. Each
    plan period lasts three months beginning on January 1,
    April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. The purchase
    price for each share of stock is the lesser of 90% of the market
    price on the first day of the plan period or 100% of the market
    price on the last day of the plan period. Stock-based
    compensation expense related to this plan was less than
    $1 million for each of the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in
    accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), which amends
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation”, and SAB 107, “Share-Based
    Payment”. These standards require that all share-based
    payments to employees be recognized in the statements of
    operations based on their fair values. The Company recognizes
    the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The
    stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated
    statements of operations is based on awards that



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of
    expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    based on historical experience. If actual results differ
    significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation
    expense and the Company’s results of operations could be
    materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs
    different assumptions in the application of
    SFAS No. 123(R), the compensation expense that the
    Company records in the future periods may differ significantly
    from what the Company has recorded in the current period.

The consolidated statements of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 include the following
    stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards,
    restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards and the employee

    As of both December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company has
    capitalized stock-based compensation costs of $2 million to

Stock
    Option Plans

In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company
    makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including
    volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option
    lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    Company uses implied volatility on its publicly traded options
    as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The
    Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate
    indicator of expected volatility because it is generally
    reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how
    future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The
    expected life assumption for grants is based on historical
    experience for the population of non-qualified stock optionees.
    The risk- free interest rate is the yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
    approximating the expected term used as the input to the
    Black-Scholes model.

The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock
    options granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

    stock. The restrictions on these shares lapse at the end of a
    three-year period. The Company has recorded less than
    $1 million of compensation expense in each of the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to the

17  Retirement
    Plans

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution plan,
    after one month of service. Employees may contribute from 1% to
    30% of eligible pay on a pre-tax basis. Prior to the amendments
    described below, which became effective on January 1, 2008,
    the Company made matching contributions of 50% for contributions
    up to 6% of eligible pay after one year of service. Employees
    are 100% vested in employee and Company matching contributions.
    For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company’s matching contributions amounted to
    $10 million, $4 million and $4 million,
    respectively.

U.S. employees were eligible to participate in the Waters
    Retirement Plan, a defined benefit, cash balance plan, after one
    year of service. Annually, the Company credited each
    employee’s account as a percentage of eligible pay based on
    years of service. In addition, each employee’s account is
    credited for investment returns at the beginning of each year
    for the prior year at the average 12 month Treasury Bill
    rate plus 0.5%, limited to a minimum rate of 5% and a maximum
    rate of 10%. An employee does not vest until the completion of
    five years of service, at which time the employee becomes 100%
    vested. The Company maintains an unfunded supplemental executive
    retirement plan, the Waters Retirement Restoration Plan, which
    is non-qualified and restores the benefits under the Waters
    Retirement Plan that are limited by IRS benefit and compensation
    maximums.

In September 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved various amendments to freeze the pay credit accrual
    under the Waters Retirement Plan and the Waters Retirement
    Restoration Plan (the “U.S. Pension Plans”)
    effective December 31, 2007. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 88, “Employers Accounting for
    Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans
    and for Termination Benefits”, the Company recorded a
    curtailment gain of $1 million. In addition, the Company
    re-measured the U.S. Pension Plans’ liabilities in
    September 2007 and the Company reduced the projected benefit
    obligation liability by $7 million with a corresponding
    adjustment, net of tax, to accumulated other comprehensive
    income as a result of the curtailment reducing the accrual for
    future service.

The Company’s Board of Directors also approved a
    $13 million payment that was contributed to the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan in the first quarter of 2008. The
    $13 million of expense was reduced by a curtailment gain of
    $1 million, relating to various amendments to freeze the
    pay credit accrual, resulting in $12 million of expense
    recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the
    year ending December 31, 2007 with $3 million included
    in cost of sales, $7 million included in selling and
    administrative expenses and $2 million included in research
    and development expenses. In addition, effective January 1,
    2008, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the
    employer matching contribution in the Waters Employee Investment
    Plan to 100% for contributions up to 6% of eligible pay, an
    increase of 3%, and eliminated the one-year service requirement
    to be eligible for matching contributions.

The Company also sponsors other unfunded employee benefit plans
    in the U.S., including a retirement healthcare plan which
    provides reimbursement for medical expenses and is contributory.
    There are various

non-U.S. retirement

plans sponsored by the Company. The eligibility and vesting of
    the

non-U.S. plans

are generally consistent with the local laws and regulations.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”, which
    amends SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Pensions”, SFAS No. 88,
    SFAS No. 106, “Employers Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions”, and
    SFAS No. 132(R). This standard requires an employer to
    recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans,
    which was only disclosed in the footnotes to the financial
    statements prior to 2006, as an asset or liability in its
    statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that
    funded status in the year in which the changes occur through
    comprehensive income.

The net periodic pension cost under SFAS No. 87 is
    made up of several components that reflect different aspects of
    the Company’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of
    benefits earned by employees. These components are determined
    using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method and are
    based on certain actuarial assumptions. The Company’s
    accounting policy is to reflect in the projected benefit
    obligation all benefit changes to which the Company is committed
    as of the current valuation date; use a market-related value of
    assets to determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior
    service costs on a straight-line basis over the expected future
    service of



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

active participants as of the date such costs are first
    recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and losses
    in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related value of
    plan assets and the projected benefit obligation over the
    expected future service of active participants.

The asset allocation policy for the U.S. Pension Plans and
    U.S. retirement healthcare plan was developed in
    consideration of the following long-term investment objectives:
    achieving a return on assets consistent with the investment
    policy, maximizing portfolio returns with at least a return of
    2.5% above the one-year Treasury Bill rate and achieving
    portfolio returns which exceeds the average return for similarly
    invested funds.

Within the equity portfolio of the U.S. retirement plans,
    investments are diversified among market capitalization and
    investment strategy. Up to 20% of the U.S. retirement
    plans’ equity portfolio may be invested in financial
    markets outside of the United States. The Company does not
    invest in its own stock within the U.S. retirement
    plans’ assets.

The Company prohibits the following types of assets or
    transactions in the U.S. retirement plans: short selling,
    margin transactions, commodities and future contracts, private
    placements, options and letter stock.

The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit
    obligation in the consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
    assumption, the Company considered the historical returns and
    the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as
    well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio and
    historical expenses paid by the plan. A one-quarter percentage
    point increase in the discount rate would decrease the
    Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters
    Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one-quarter
    percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate of
    return would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit
    cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million.

During fiscal year 2009, the Company expects to contribute
    approximately $7 million to $11 million to the
    Company’s defined benefit plans.

18  Business
    Segment Information

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information”, establishes standards
    for reporting information about operating segments in annual
    financial statements and requires selected information for those
    segments to be presented in interim financial reports of public
    business enterprises. It also establishes standards for related
    disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and
    major customers. The Company’s business activities, for
    which discrete financial information is available, are regularly
    reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision makers.
    As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it
    has two operating segments: Waters Division and TA Division.

Waters Division is in the business of designing, manufacturing,
    distributing and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and
    other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used
    along with other analytical instruments. TA Division is in the
    business of designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing
    thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The
    Company’s two divisions are its operating segments and each
    has similar economic characteristics; product processes;
    products and services; types and classes of customers; methods
    of distribution and regulatory environments. Because of these
    similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one
    reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer
    to the consolidated financial statements for financial
    information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company.

The Company experiences an increase in sales in the fourth
    quarter, as a result of purchasing habits on capital goods of
    customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by
    calendar year end. Selling and administrative expenses are
    typically higher in the second and third quarters over the first
    quarter in each year as the Company’s annual payroll merit
    increases take effect. Selling and administrative expenses will
    vary in the fourth quarter in relation to performance in the
    quarter and for the year. In the second quarter of 2008, the
    Company recorded out-of-period adjustments related to
    capitalized software amortization and the income tax provision
    (Note 3). In the third quarter of 2008, the Company
    recorded a $5 million tax provision associated with the
    reorganization of certain foreign legal entities (Note 10).
    In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a
    $7 million provision related to ongoing litigation
    (Note 11). In the third quarter of 2007, the Company
    recorded a $12 million expense related to the contribution
    into the Waters Employee Investment Plan, which was made in the
    first quarter of 2008 (Note 17).

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
    officer (principal executive and principal financial officer),
    with the participation of management, evaluated the
    effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
    this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
    as of December 31, 2008 and (1) designed to ensure
    that information required to be disclosed by the Company,
    including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it
    files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including its
    chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow
    timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and
    (2) designed to provide reasonable assurance that
    information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
