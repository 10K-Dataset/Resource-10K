PART I

Item 1:

Business

General

Waters Corporation (“Waters” or the
    “Company”), an analytical instrument manufacturer,
    designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters
    Division, high performance liquid chromatography
    (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography
    (“UPLC” and together with HPLC, herein referred to as
    “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”)
    instrument systems and support products, including
    chromatography columns, other consumable products and
    comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are
    complementary products that can be integrated together and used
    along with other analytical instruments. Through its TA Division
    (“TA”), the Company designs, manufactures, sells and
    services thermal analysis and rheometry instruments which are
    used primarily in predicting the suitability of polymers and
    viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
    health care products. The Company is also a developer and
    supplier of software based products that interface with the
    Company’s instruments as well as other instrument
    manufacturers’ instruments.

The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, life
    science, biochemical, industrial, academic and government
    customers working in research and development, quality assurance
    and other laboratory applications. The Company’s LC and MS
    instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to
    detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and
    biological composition of materials as well as to purify a full
    range of compounds. These instruments are used in drug discovery
    and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis
    of proteins in disease processes (known as
    “proteomics”), food safety analyses and environmental
    testing. The Company’s thermal analysis and rheometry
    instruments are used in predicting the suitability of fine
    chemicals and polymers for uses in various industrial, consumer
    goods and health care products.

The Company typically experiences a seasonal increase in sales
    in its fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for
    capital goods by customers who tend to exhaust their spending
    budgets by calendar year-end.

Waters is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding
    common stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating
    subsidiary. Waters became a publicly traded company with its
    initial public offering (“IPO”) in November 1995.
    Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and
    complementary technologies to its range of products with the
    acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited
    (“Micromass”) in September 1997.

Business
    Segments

The Company’s business activities, for which discrete
    financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and
    evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer. As a result of this
    evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating
    segments: Waters Division and TA Division. As indicated above,
    the Company operates in the analytical instruments industry,
    manufacturing, distributing and servicing products in three
    complementary technologies: LC and MS instruments, columns and
    other consumables, and thermal analysis and rheometry
    instruments. The Company’s two operating segments, Waters
    Division and TA, have similar economic characteristics, product
    processes, products and services, types and classes of
    customers, methods of distribution, and regulatory environments.
    Because of these similarities, the two segments have been
    aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement
    purposes.

Information concerning revenues and long-lived assets
    attributable to each of the Company’s geographic areas is
    set forth in Note 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

WATERS
    DIVISION

High
    Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid
    Chromatography

Developed in the 1950’s, HPLC is the standard technique
    used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a
    variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes
    that HPLC’s performance capabilities enable it to separate
    and identify approximately 80% of all known chemicals and
    materials. As a result, HPLC is used to



analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research
    and development purposes, quality control and process
    engineering applications.

The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served
    by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these
    markets, HPLC is used extensively to identify new drugs, to
    develop manufacturing methods, and to assure the potency and
    purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of
    other applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for
    nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations, the
    testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing
    industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as
    chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by
    universities, research institutions and government agencies, and
    in many instances, the United States Food and Drug
    Administration (“FDA”) and the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and their
    international counterparts who mandate testing that requires
    HPLC instrumentation.

Traditionally, a typical HPLC system has consisted of five basic
    components: solvent delivery system, sample injector, separation
    column, detector and data acquisition unit. The solvent delivery
    system pumps the solvent through the HPLC system, while the
    sample injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow. The
    chromatography column then separates the sample into its
    components for analysis by the detector, which measures the
    presence and amount of the constituents. The data acquisition
    unit, usually referred to as the instrument’s software or
    data system, then records and stores the information from the
    detector.

In March 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the
    Company described as Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography
    that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter
    particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY
    UPLC

®

,
    to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic
    bands that are generated by these small particles. By using the
    ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more
    comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in
    comparison with many analyses performed by HPLC. In addition, in
    using ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the
    range of application beyond that of HPLC, enabling the
    uncovering of new levels of scientific information. Though it
    offers significant performance advantages, ACQUITY UPLC is
    compatible with the Company’s software products and the
    general operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the
    Company’s customers and field sales and support
    organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology
    and instrument. The Company began shipping the ACQUITY UPLC in
    the third quarter of 2004. During 2006 and 2005, the Company
    experienced growth in the instrument systems product line
    primarily from the sales of the ACQUITY UPLC.

The primary consumable products for LC are chromatography
    columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in
    the LC testing process and are replaced at regular intervals.
    The chromatography column contains one of several types of
    packing, typically stationary phase particles made from silica.
    As the sample flows through the column, it is separated into its
    constituent components.

Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded, as well as
    competitors’, LC systems. The Company believes that it is
    one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica,
    packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the
    Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key
    attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and
    react quickly to new customer requirements. At this time, the
    Company believes that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used
    nearly exclusively on its ACQUITY UPLC instrument and,
    furthermore, that its ACQUITY UPLC instrument will primarily use
    ACQUITY UPLC columns. In 2006 and 2005, excluding the small
    impact from acquisitions mentioned below, the Company
    experienced growth in its LC chromatography column and sample
    preparation businesses, especially in the
    XBridge

tm

,
    SunFire

tm

and ACQUITY UPLC columns, as well as in
    Oasis

®

sample preparation cartridges.

In February 2006, the Company acquired the net assets of the
    food safety business of VICAM Limited Partnership
    (“VICAM”) for $13.8 million in cash. VICAM is a
    leading provider of tests to identify and quantify toxins in
    various agricultural commodities. The Company’s test kits
    provide reliable, quantitative detection of particular toxins
    through the choice of flurometer or HPLC. In December 2006, the
    Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
    Environmental Resources Associates, Inc. (“ERA”), a
    provider of environmental testing products for quality control,
    proficiency testing and specialty calibration chemicals used in
    environmental laboratories, for $62.5 million in cash and
    the assumption of $3.8 million of debt. ERA also provides
    product



support services required to help laboratories with their
    federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with
    quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis.

Based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and
    publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company
    believes that it is one of the world’s largest
    manufacturers and distributors of LC instruments,
    chromatography columns and other consumables and related
    services. The Company also believes that it has the leading LC
    market share in the United States, Europe and Asia and believes
    it has a leading market share position in Japan.

Waters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in
    configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation,
    from component configured systems for academic research
    applications to fully automated
    Alliance

®

2795 systems for high speed screening, and with a variety of
    detection technologies, from ultra-violet (“UV”)
    absorbance to MS, optimized for certain analyses. The Company
    also manufactures tailored LC systems for the analysis of
    biologics as well as an LC detector utilizing evaporative light
    scattering technology to expand the usage of LC to compounds
    that are not amenable to UV absorbance detection.

The servicing and support of LC and MS instruments and
    accessories is an important source of revenue for the Waters
    Division. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale
    of support plans, demand service, customer training and
    performance validation services. Support plans most typically
    involve scheduled instrument maintenance, a commitment to supply
    software and firmware upgrades and an agreement to promptly
    repair a non-functioning instrument in return for a fee
    described in a multi-year contract that is priced according to
    the configuration of the instrument.

Mass
    Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is
    used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials,
    and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of
    molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that
    have been converted into ions.

The Company believes it is a market leader in the development,
    manufacture, sale and distribution of MS instruments. These
    instruments can be integrated and used along with other
    complementary analytical instruments and systems such as LC,
    chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis
    chromatography and gas chromatography. A wide variety of
    instrumental designs fall within the overall category of MS
    instrumentation, including devices that incorporate quadrupole,
    ion trap, time of flight (“Tof”) and classical
    magnetic sector technologies. Furthermore, these technologies
    are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain
    experiments.

Currently, the Company offers and provides service, support and
    training for a wide range of MS instruments utilizing various
    combinations of quadrupole, Tof and magnetic sector designs.
    These instruments are used in drug discovery and development, as
    well as for environmental testing. The majority of mass
    spectrometers sold by the Company are designed to utilize an LC
    system as the sample introduction device. These products supply
    a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science,
    pharmaceutical, biomedical, clinical and environmental market
    segments worldwide. Service sales, included in Waters Division
    total service sales, are primarily related to the sale of parts
    and labor associated with instrument repair and routine
    maintenance.

The mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection
    device for LC. The Company’s smaller sized mass
    spectrometers (such as the SQD and the TQD) are often referred
    to as LC “detectors” and are either sold as part of an
    LC system or as an LC upgrade. Large quadrupole systems, such as
    the Waters Quattro
    micro

tm

and Quattro
    Premier

tm

XE instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for
    late stage drug development, including clinical trial testing,
    and Q-Tof instruments, such as the Company’s Q-Tof
    micro

tm

and Q-Tof
    Premier

tm

instruments, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in
    disease processes, an application sometimes referred to as
    “proteomics”. In late 2006, the Company also
    introduced a new Tandem Quadrupole device, the TQD, and a new
    hybrid quadrupole — time of flight technology system,
    the
    Synapt

tm

HDMS. The Synapt HDMS system integrates ion mobility technology
    within a Q-Tof geometry instrument configuration and uniquely
    allows researchers to glean molecular shape information, a novel
    capability for a mass spectrometry instrument. The introduction
    of these new products has augmented the recent growth of the MS
    instrument systems. In 2005, the Company introduced a new
    enhanced tandem quadrupole instrument, the Quattro Premier XE
    and the LCT
    Premier

tm

.

The LCT Premier is



an LC, electrospray-Tof instrument designed to deliver a higher
    level of mass accuracy and the ability for more precise
    quantitative analysis. In 2004, the Company introduced a new
    Q-Tof configuration mass spectrometry system, the Q-Tof Premier
    to replace its Q-Tof
    Ultima

®

line of systems and offer a higher level of instrument
    performance to its customers. The Q-Tof Premier is a tandem mass
    spectrometry system developed to provide increased levels of
    sensitivity and specificity to customers involved in challenging
    analyses such as those often encountered in proteomics and
    metabolite profiling experiments. The Company began shipping the
    Q-Tof Premier in the fourth quarter of 2004. The Q-Tof Premier
    is compatible and often purchased with a specialized ACQUITY
    UPLC as an inlet, a device to efficiently introduce a separated
    sample into the mass spectrometer.

LC-MS

LC and MS are instrumental technologies often embodied within an
    analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of
    analyses or as a general purpose analytical device. An
    increasing percentage of the Company’s customers are
    purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it is
    becoming common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within
    the same laboratory and be operated by the same user. The
    descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical
    segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical
    categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly
    in today’s instrument market, this segmentation and
    categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of
    instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS
    technologies as part of a single device. In response to this
    development and to further promote the high utilization of these
    hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters
    Division to develop, manufacture, sell, service and support
    integrated LC-MS systems.

TA
    DIVISION

Thermal
    Analysis

Thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of
    materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature
    affect several characteristics of materials such as their
    physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical
    properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal
    analysis techniques. Consequently, thermal analysis techniques
    are widely used in the development, production and
    characterization of materials in various industries such as
    plastics, chemicals, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and
    electronics.

Rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in
    characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow
    properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity
    and deformation under different types of “loading” or
    conditions. The information obtained under such conditions
    provides insight to a material’s behavior during
    manufacturing, transport, usage and storage.

Thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are heavily used in
    material testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide
    information useful in predicting the suitability of polymers and
    viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
    health care products. As with systems offered through the Waters
    Division, a range of instrumental configurations are available
    with increasing levels of sample handling and information
    processing automation. In addition, systems and accompanying
    software packages can be tailored for specific applications. For
    example, the
    Q-Series

tm

family of differential scanning calorimeters includes a range of
    instruments from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive
    systems that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a
    variety of sample cells and temperature control features for
    analyzing a broad range of materials. In 2006, TA introduced
    four new differential scanning calorimeters. During 2005, TA
    introduced a new thermogravimetric analyzer (“TGA”),
    the Q5000IR TGA, and a new AR-G2 rheometer. The introduction of
    these new products significantly helped grow the TA business in
    2006 and 2005.

In August 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Thermometric AB (“Thermometrics”), a
    manufacturer of high performance microcalorimeters, for
    $2.5 million in cash and the assumption of
    $1.2 million in debt. Thermometrics’ flagship product,
    the TAM III, is a modular calorimeter that employs
    proprietary technology to deliver unparalleled calorimetric
    sensitivity and temperature stability. It is routinely used to
    characterize materials, and their interactions, in the fields of
    pharmaceuticals, life and materials sciences. The TAM III
    systems complement TA’s industry leading Q-Series
    differential scanning calorimeter product line and enhances
    TA’s position as the world’s leading supplier of
    thermal analysis instrumentation.



The Company sells, supports and services these product offerings
    through TA, headquartered in New Castle, Delaware. TA operates
    independently from the Waters Division though several of its
    overseas offices are situated in Waters facilities. TA has
    dedicated field sales and service operations. Service sales are
    primarily derived from the sale of replacement parts and from
    billed labor fees associated with the repair, maintenance and
    upgrade of installed systems.

Customers

The Company has a broad and diversified customer base that
    includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts,
    universities and government agencies. The pharmaceutical segment
    represents the Company’s largest sector and includes
    multi-national pharmaceutical companies, generic drug
    manufacturers and biotechnology companies. The Company’s
    other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers,
    polymer manufacturers, food and beverage companies and
    environmental testing laboratories. The Company also sells to
    various universities and government agencies worldwide. The
    Company’s technical support staff works closely with its
    customers in developing and implementing applications that meet
    their full range of analytical requirements.

The Company does not rely on any single customer or one group of
    customers for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal
    years 2006 and 2005, no single customer accounted for more than
    3% of the Company’s net sales.

Sales and
    Service

The Company has one of the largest sales and service
    organizations in the industry focused exclusively on its LC, MS
    and thermal analysis installed base. Across these product
    technologies, using respective specialized sales and service
    forces, the Company serves its customer base with approximately
    2,400 field representatives in 82 sales offices throughout the
    world as of December 31, 2006, compared to approximately
    2,400 field representatives in 87 sales offices as of
    December 31, 2005. The Company’s sales representatives
    have direct responsibility for account relationships, while
    service representatives work in the field to install instruments
    and minimize instrument downtime for customers. Technical
    support representatives work directly with customers, helping
    them to develop applications and procedures. The Company
    provides customers with comprehensive product literature and
    also makes consumable products available through a dedicated
    catalog.

Manufacturing

The Company provides high quality LC products by controlling
    each stage of production of its instruments, columns and
    chemical reagents. The Company currently assembles a substantial
    portion of its LC instruments at its facility in Milford,
    Massachusetts, where it performs machining, assembly and
    testing. The Milford facility maintains a Quality Management
    System in accordance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2000, ISO
    13485:2003 and applicable regulatory requirements (including FDA
    QSR and the European IVD Directives). The Company outsources
    manufacturing of certain electronic components such as
    computers, monitors and circuit boards to outside vendors that
    can meet the Company’s quality requirements. In 2006, the
    Company transitioned the manufacturing of the Alliance HPLC
    instrument system to a company in Singapore. The Company expects
    to continue to pursue other outsourcing opportunities in the
    future. During 2006, the Company added four manufacturing
    locations in connection with the ERA, VICAM and Thermometrics
    acquisitions. ERA manufactures environmental proficiency kits in
    Arvada, Colorado. VICAM manufactures antibody resin and magnetic
    beads that are packed into columns and kits in Watertown,
    Massachusetts and Nixa, Missouri. Thermometrics manufactures
    high performance microcalorimeters in Sweden.

The Company manufactures its LC columns at its facilities in
    Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland, where it processes,
    sizes and treats silica and polymeric media that are packed into
    columns, solid phase extraction cartridges and bulk shipping
    containers. The Wexford facility also manufactures and
    distributes certain data, instruments and software components
    for the Company’s LC, MS and thermal analysis product
    lines. These facilities meet the same ISO and FDA standards met
    by the Milford, Massachusetts facility and are registered with
    the FDA.

The Company manufactures most of its MS products at its
    facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire, England and
    Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the
    Company’s MS instruments are



manufactured by long-standing outside contractors. Each stage of
    this supply chain is closely monitored by the Company to
    maintain its high quality and performance standards. The
    instruments, components or modules are then returned to the
    Company’s facilities where its engineers perform final
    assembly, calibrations to customer specifications and quality
    control procedures. The Company’s MS facilities meet
    similar ISO and FDA standards met by the Milford, Massachusetts
    facility and are registered with the FDA.

Thermal analysis and rheology products are manufactured at TA.
    Thermal analysis products are manufactured at the Company’s
    New Castle, Delaware facility. Rheometry products are
    manufactured at the Company’s New Castle, Delaware and
    Crawley, England facilities. Similar to MS, certain elements of
    TA’s products are manufactured by outside contractors and
    are then returned to the Company’s facilities for final
    assembly, calibration and quality control. The Company’s
    thermal analysis facilities are certified to ISO 9001:2000
    standards.

Research
    and Development

The Company maintains an active research and development program
    focused on the development and commercialization of products
    that both complement and update the existing product offering.
    The Company’s research and development expenditures for
    2006, 2005 and 2004 were $77.3 million, $66.9 million
    and $65.2 million, respectively. Included in the 2006
    expense is $5.1 million associated with the adoption of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
    No. 123(R), “Share-based Payment”. Nearly all of
    the current LC products of the Company have been developed at
    the Company’s main research and development center located
    in Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the
    Company’s extensive field organizations. The majority of
    the MS products have been developed at facilities in
    England and nearly all of the current thermal analysis products
    have been developed at the Company’s research and
    development center in New Castle, Delaware. At December 31,
    2006, there were approximately 571 employees involved in the
    Company’s research and development efforts, compared to 555
    employees in 2005. The Company has increased research and
    development expenses relating to acquisitions and the
    Company’s continued commitment to invest significantly in
    new product development and existing product enhancements.
    Despite the Company’s active research and development
    programs, there can be no assurances that the Company’s
    product development and commercialization efforts will be
    successful or that the products developed by the Company will be
    accepted by the marketplace.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 4,700 employees, with 45%
    located in the United States, and approximately 4,500 employees,
    with 47% located in the United States, at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The increase of 4% over 2005 is
    primarily due to increases in manufacturing operations, research
    and development and from acquisitions. The Company considers its
    employee relations, in general, to be good. The Company’s
    employees are not unionized or affiliated with any internal or
    external labor organizations. The Company believes that its
    future success depends, in a large part, upon its continued
    ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. In
    February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction and
    expense reallocation plan, primarily in the U.S. and Europe,
    resulting in the employment of approximately 74 employees being
    terminated, all of which had left the Company as of
    December 31, 2006.

Competition

The analytical instrument and systems market is competitive. The
    Company encounters competition from several worldwide instrument
    manufacturers in both domestic and foreign markets for each of
    its three technologies. The Company competes in its markets
    primarily on the basis of instrument performance, reliability
    and service and, to a lesser extent, price. Some
    competitors’ businesses are generally more diversified and
    less focused on the Company’s primary instrument markets.
    Some competitors have greater financial and other resources than
    the Company.

In the markets served by LC, MS and LC-MS, the Company’s
    principal competitors include: Applied BioSystems, Inc., Agilent
    Technologies, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Varian, Inc.,
    Shimadzu Corporation and Bruker BioSciences Corporation. In the
    markets served by TA, the Company’s principal competitors
    include: PerkinElmer Inc., Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,
    NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,



Malvern Instruments Ltd. and Anton-Paar. The Company is not
    currently aware of a competitor that it believes offers an
    instrument system comparable to its ACQUITY UPLC.

The market for consumable HPLC products, including separation
    columns, is highly competitive and more fragmented than the
    analytical instruments market. The Company encounters
    competition in the consumable columns market from chemical
    companies that produce column chemicals and small, specialized
    companies that pack and distribute columns. The Company believes
    that it is one of the few suppliers that process silica, packs
    columns, and distributes its own product. The Company competes
    in this market on the basis of reproducibility, reputation and
    performance and, to a lesser extent, price. The Company’s
    principal competitors for consumable products include:
    Phenomenex, Supelco Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., Alltech
    International Holdings, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and
    Merck and Co., Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to
    offer a predictable level of performance when used with ACQUITY
    UPLC columns to effect the chemical separation. UPLC columns are
    both fluidically and electronically connected to the ACQUITY
    UPLC instrument to allow users to simultaneously employ and
    track the performance status of the UPLC column. The Company
    believes that the expansion of ACQUITY UPLC technology will
    enhance its chromatographic column business because of the high
    level of synergy between ACQUITY UPLC columns and the ACQUITY
    UPLC instrument.

Patents,
    Trademarks and Licenses

The Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents
    and has patent applications pending in the United States
    and abroad. Certain technology and software is licensed from
    third parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The
    Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as
    valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes
    that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is,
    in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss
    would materially affect the Company’s business as a whole.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws,
    regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or
    operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as
    discharges to air and water, as well as handling and disposal
    practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose
    liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages
    resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases
    of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently
    conducts its operations, and in the past has operated its
    business, in substantial compliance with applicable
    environmental laws. From time to time, operations of the Company
    have resulted or may result in noncompliance with, or liability
    for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The Company does not
    currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its
    operations, financial condition or competitive position as a
    result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws.

results as well as additional risk factors set forth below.
    Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans,
    intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking
    statements, whether because of these factors or for other
    reasons. The Company does not assume any obligation to update
    any forward-looking statements.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

Competition
    and the Analytical Instrument Market:

The analytical instrument market and, in particular, the portion
    related to the Company’s HPLC, UPLC, MS,

LC-MS,

thermal analysis and rheometry product lines, is highly
    competitive, and the Company encounters competition from several
    international instrument manufacturers and other companies in
    both domestic and foreign markets. Some competitors’
    businesses are generally more diversified and less focused on
    the Company’s primary instrument markets. There can be no
    assurances that the Company’s competitors will not
    introduce more effective and less costly products than those of
    the Company, or that the Company will be able to increase its
    sales and profitability from new product introductions. There
    can be no assurances that the Company’s sales and marketing
    forces will compete successfully against its competitors in the
    future.

Additionally, the analytical instrument market may, from time to
    time, experience low sales growth. Approximately 52% and 54% of
    the Company’s net sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively,
    were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    industries, which may be periodically subject to unfavorable
    market conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable industry
    conditions could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

Risk of
    Disruption:

The Company manufactures LC instruments at facilities in
    Milford, Massachusetts and Singapore, separation columns at its
    facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland, MS
    products at its facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire,
    England and Wexford, Ireland, thermal analysis products at its
    facility in New Castle, Delaware and rheometry products at its
    facilities in New Castle, Delaware and Crawley, England. Any
    prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these
    facilities, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or
    damage to either facility or other reasons, could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations or financial condition.

Foreign
    Operations and Exchange Rates:

Approximately 68% and 66% of the Company’s 2006 and
    2005 net sales, respectively, were outside of the United
    States and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies. As
    a result, a significant portion of the Company’s sales and
    operations are subject to certain risks, including adverse
    developments in the foreign political and economic environment,
    tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and
    managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax
    consequences.



Additionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s
    net sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
    Significant increases in the value of the U.S. dollar
    relative to certain foreign currencies could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or
    financial condition.

Reliance
    on Key Management:

The operation of the Company requires managerial and operational
    expertise. None of the key management employees has an
    employment contract with the Company, and there can be no
    assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company.
    If, for any reason, such key personnel do not continue to be
    active in management, the Company’s results of operations
    or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Protection
    of Intellectual Property:

The Company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights
    and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as
    material and patentable. However, there can be no assurances
    that any patents held by the Company will not be challenged,
    invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted
    thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company.
    Conversely, there could be successful claims against the Company
    by third party patent holders with respect to certain Company
    products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of
    such third parties. The Company’s patents, including those
    licensed from others, expire on various dates. If the Company is
    unable to protect its intellectual property rights, it could
    have an adverse and material effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial condition.

Reliance
    on Customer Demand:

The demand for the Company’s products is dependent upon the
    size of the markets for its LC, MS, thermal analysis and
    rheometry products, the level of capital expenditures of the
    Company’s customers, the rate of economic growth in the
    Company’s major markets and competitive considerations.
    There can be no assurances that the Company’s results of
    operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted
    by a change in any of the factors listed above.

Reliance
    on Suppliers:

Most of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by
    the Company are available from a number of different suppliers;
    however, a number of items are purchased from limited or single
    sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have a
    temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results
    of the Company. The Company believes alternative sources could
    ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials, but a
    prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components
    could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition or results of operations and could result in damage to
    its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely
    affect the Company’s business.

Reliance
    on Outside Manufacturers:

Certain components or modules of the Company’s MS
    instruments are manufactured by long-standing outside
    contractors. In 2006, the Company transitioned the manufacturing
    of the Alliance HPLC instrument system to a company in
    Singapore. Disruptions of service by these outside contractors
    could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the
    financial results of the Company. The Company believes that it
    could obtain alternative sources for these components or
    modules, but a prolonged inability to obtain these components or
    modules could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition or results of operations.

Item 3:

Legal
    Proceedings

Hewlett-Packard
    Company:

The Company filed suit in the United States against
    Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH (collectively,
    “HP”), seeking a declaration that certain products
    sold under the mark “Alliance” did not constitute an
    infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or its foreign
    subsidiaries (the “HP patents”). The action in the
    United States was dismissed for lack of controversy. Actions
    seeking revocation or nullification of foreign HP patents were
    filed by the Company in Germany, France and England. A German
    patent tribunal found the HP German patent to be valid. In
    Germany, France and England, HP and its successor, Agilent
    Technologies Deutschland GmbH (“Agilent”), brought
    actions alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump may
    infringe the HP patents. In England, the Court of Appeal found
    the HP patent valid and infringed. The Company’s petitions
    for leave to appeal to the House of Lords were denied. A trial
    on damages was scheduled for November 2004.

In March 2004, Agilent brought a new action against the Company
    alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump continued to
    infringe the HP patents. At a hearing held in the UK in June
    2004, the UK court postponed the previously scheduled November
    2004 damages trial until March 2005. Instead, the court
    scheduled the trial in the new action for November 2004. In
    December 2004, following a trial in the new action, the UK court
    ruled that the Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent
    filed an appeal in that action, which was heard in July 2005,
    and the UK Appellate Court upheld the lower court’s ruling
    of non-infringement. The damages trial scheduled for March 2005
    was postponed pending this appeal and rescheduled for December
    2005. In December 2005, a trial on damages commenced in the
    first action and continued for six days prior to a holiday
    recess. In February 2006, the Company, HP and Agilent entered
    into a settlement agreement (the “Agilent Settlement
    Agreement”) with respect to the first action and a consent
    order dismissing the case was entered. The Agilent Settlement
    Agreement provides for the release of the Company and its UK
    affiliate from each and every claim under Agilent’s
    European patent (UK) number 309,596 arising out of the
    prior sale by either of them of Alliance Separations Modules
    incorporating the patented technology. In consideration of
    entering into the Agilent Settlement Agreement and the consent
    order, the Company made a payment to Agilent of 3.5 million
    British Pounds, in full and final settlement of Agilent’s
    claim for damages and in relation to all claims for costs and
    interest in the case.

In France, the Paris District Court has found the HP patent
    valid and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company appealed
    the French decision and, in April 2004, the French appeals court
    affirmed the Paris District Court’s finding of
    infringement. The Company has filed a further appeal in the
    case. The Company has sought a declaration from the French court
    that, as was found in both the UK and Germany, certain modified
    features of the Alliance pump do not infringe the HP patents. A
    hearing on this matter is currently scheduled for June 2007. In
    the German case, a German court has found the patent infringed.
    The Company appealed the German decision and, in December 2004,
    the German appeals court reversed the trial court and issued a
    finding of non-infringement in favor of the Company. Agilent is
    seeking an appeal in that action and, in July 2005, brought a
    new action against the Company alleging that certain features of
    the Alliance pump continue to infringe the HP patents. In August
    2006, following a trial in this new action the German court
    ruled that the Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent
    has filed an appeal in this action.

The Company recorded provisions in the quarters ended
    June 30, 2002, April 3, 2004, and December 31,
    2005 for estimated damages, legal fees, and court costs incurred
    with respect to this ongoing litigation. The provisions
    represent management’s best estimate of the probable and
    reasonably estimable loss related to the litigations.

Selected
    Financial Data

Reference is made to information contained in the section
    entitled “Selected Financial Data” on page 77 of
    this

included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data.

Item 7:

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Business
    and Financial Overview:

The Company’s sales were $1,280.2 million,
    $1,158.2 million and $1,104.5 million in 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively. Sales grew 11% in 2006 over 2005 and 5%
    in 2005 over 2004. Overall, the sales growth achieved in these
    years can be primarily attributed to the Company’s
    introduction of new products and sustained growth in Asia. The
    2006 and 2005 sales growth benefited from the introduction of
    the ACQUITY
    UPLC

®

and the Quattro
    Premier

tm

XE based systems and an increase in chemistry consumable sales.
    In addition, the 2006 sales growth also benefited from the
    introduction of the new SQD, TQD and
    Synapt

tm

HDMS mass spectrometry systems which were introduced in the
    second-half of 2006.

The effect of currency translation benefited the 2006 sales
    growth rate by less than 1%, principally in Europe, and was
    neutral to the 2005 sales growth rates. U.S. sales
    increased 4% and 2%; European sales grew 12% and 3%; and Asian
    sales (including Japan) grew 19% and 10% during 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Asian sales growth was strongest in India and
    China.

In 2006, global sales to pharmaceutical customers rebounded from
    2005 levels and industry-wide sales grew 8%, as these customers
    increased their capital spending on the Company’s new
    products. Global sales to pharmaceutical customers were weak in
    2005 as the Company’s large pharmaceutical customers
    decreased capital spending as these customers dealt with various
    new drug pipeline, merger and acquisition and litigation issues.
    Global sales to industrial and food safety customers continued
    its positive trend as sales grew 13% in 2006 over 2005. The TA
    Division (“TA”) sales, a business with a heavy
    industrial focus, grew 9% and 8% for 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, and the sales growth can be attributed to new
    product introductions and expansion of its Asian businesses.

The Waters Division sales grew by 11% in 2006 and 4% in 2005.
    The Waters Division’s products and services consist of
    LC & MS instrument systems which include high
    performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra
    performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC” and together
    with HPLC, herein referred to as “LC”), mass



spectrometry (“MS”) products, chemistry consumable
    products, and LC and MS services. The sales growth is strongly
    influenced by ACQUITY UPLC sales and sales growth in the
    chemistry consumables business.

In 2006, the Company continued to enhance its operations in Asia
    by expanding an existing partnership to manufacture
    instrumentation in Singapore. The Company transitioned the
    manufacturing of the
    Alliance

®

instrument system and, while the Company expects to achieve cost
    savings efficiencies in the future, the overall impact during
    the

ramp-up

in 2006 was slightly negative on gross profit margin percentages
    in 2006 compared to 2005.

Operating income was $295.2 million, $283.2 million
    and $284.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    Operating income was primarily impacted by the following:

•

The $12.0 million net increase in 2006 operating income
    from 2005 is primarily a result of the increased sales volume
    being partially offset by the $28.0 million of the
    additional stock-based compensation costs incurred as a result
    of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
    (“SFAS”) No. 123(R) “Share-Based
    Payment” and $8.5 million of restructuring costs
    incurred relating to the February 2006 cost reduction
    initiative. The Company does not expect to incur any significant
    additional restructuring costs for this initiative in the future.

•

The $1.7 million net decrease in operating income in 2005
    from 2004 is primarily attributable to a litigation provision of
    $3.1 million related to a patent litigation settlement with
    Hewlett-Packard Company in February 2006 that was recorded in
    the fourth quarter of 2005. The remaining increase in 2005
    operating income was primarily a result of sales growth. The
    2004 operating income included the benefit of a litigation
    judgment in the amount of $17.1 million from Perkin-Elmer
    Corporation partially offset by litigation provisions of
    $7.8 million and a technology license asset impairment of
    $4.0 million.

The Company continuously evaluates its equity investments for
    impairment and, as a result, the Company recorded, in net other
    expense, a net write-down of certain equity investments in the
    amount of $5.8 million, $3.1 million and
    $1.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included
    in the 2005 net write-down is a gain on the sale of an
    equity investment of $1.7 million.

Operating cash flow was $263.6 million, $298.1 million
    and $259.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    Included in the 2006 operating cash flow was a $9.0 million
    tax payment associated with the American Jobs Creation Act
    (“AJCA”), a $3.5 million litigation payment and
    $7.0 million of severance and other facility related
    payments made in connection with the cost reduction initiative.
    The 2005 operating cash flow included an AJCA payment of
    approximately $10.0 million. The decline in the 2006
    operating cash flow can also be attributed to an increase in
    inventories of $29.9 million over 2005. The inventory
    increase is attributable to the

ramp-up

of
    new product introductions and an increase in the safety stock
    levels resulting from the outsourcing of the Alliance instrument
    system manufacturing. Operating cash flows continue to benefit
    from the improvement in accounts receivable collection measured
    in days-sales-outstanding (“DSO”). DSO’s were
    64 days, 70 days and 76 days at December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures
    related to property, plant, equipment, software capitalization
    and other intangibles were $51.4 million,
    $51.0 million and $66.2 million, in 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. Capital expenditures have remained
    substantially unchanged over the last three years. Capital
    expenditures in 2004 included $18.1 million for the
    purchase of a building adjacent to the Company’s
    headquarters.

The Company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses,
    product lines and technologies to augment the Waters and TA
    operating divisions. On December 15, 2006, the Company
    acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Environmental
    Resources Associates, Inc., (“ERA”), a provider of
    environmental testing products for quality control, proficiency
    testing and specialty calibration chemicals used by
    environmental laboratories, for approximately $62.5 million
    in cash and the assumption of $3.8 million of debt. The
    Company expects that ERA will add approximately
    $17.0 million of product sales and be about neutral to
    earnings in 2007 after debt service costs. In February 2006, the
    Company acquired the net assets of the food safety business of
    VICAM Limited Partnership (“VICAM”) for approximately
    $13.8 million. VICAM products added approximately
    $8.0 million to sales and were about neutral to earnings
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 after debt service
    costs. VICAM product sales in 2007 are expected to be
    approximately $10.0 million. In August 2006, the Company
    acquired all of



the outstanding capital stock of Thermometric AB
    (“Thermometrics”), a manufacturer of high performance
    microcalorimeters, for a total of $2.5 million in cash and
    the assumption of $1.2 million of debt. Thermometrics’
    products added approximately $1.5 million to sales and were
    neutral to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    Thermometrics sales are expected to be approximately
    $4.0 million in 2007.

During 2006, management continued to apply the Company’s
    net cash flow to repurchase shares of Company stock through the
    $500.0 million program authorized by the Company’s
    Board of Directors in October 2005. During 2006, the Company
    purchased 5.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost
    of $249.2 million. The Company has repurchased an aggregate
    of 11.3 million shares of its common stock under this
    program at a cost of $465.3 million, leaving
    $34.7 million authorized for future repurchases. The
    Company believes that the share repurchase programs are
    beneficial to shareholders by increasing earnings per share
    through reducing the number of outstanding shares. The Company
    also believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund
    these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels, and
    invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to
    further grow the Company’s sales and profits.

In January 2007, the Company terminated multiple term loan and
    revolving credit agreements entered into 2005 and 2004. The
    Company refinanced the credit agreement facilities to expand its
    debt capacity to $1.1 billion, reduce its borrowing rates
    and extend the maturity by two years.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2005

Net
    Sales:

Net sales for 2006 and 2005 were $1,280.2 million and
    $1,158.2 million, respectively, an increase of 11%. Foreign
    currency translation benefited the 2006 sales growth rate by
    less than 1%. Product sales were $922.5 million and
    $834.7 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase
    of 11% over 2005. The increase in product sales was primarily
    due to the overall positive growth in LC, MS and TA instrument
    systems sales, an increase in chemistry consumables sales and
    the effect of acquisitions. Service sales were
    $357.7 million and $323.6 million in the 2006 and
    2005, respectively, an increase of 11%. The increase was
    primarily attributable to growth in the Company’s installed
    base of instruments and higher sales of service contracts.

The following commentary discusses the Company’s sales
    performance by product line.

Waters
    Division Net Sales:

The Waters Division sales grew approximately 11% in 2006. The
    effect of foreign currency translation benefited the 2006 Waters
    Division sales growth by less than 1%. Chemistry consumables
    sales grew approximately 18% in 2006. This growth was driven by
    increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC proprietary column
    technology, new
    XBridge

tm

columns,
    Oasis

®

sample preparation products and the sales associated with the
    acquired VICAM product line. LC and MS service sales grew 9% in
    2006 due to increased sales of service plans to the higher
    installed base of customers. LC and MS instrument systems sales
    grew 9% in 2006. The increase in LC and MS instrument sales
    during 2006 is primarily attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY
    UPLC systems and higher MS triple quadrupole system sales,
    offset by a decline in lower-end MS systems sales. Waters
    Division sales by product mix was substantially unchanged in
    2006 and 2005 with instruments, chemistry and service
    representing approximately 57%, 16% and 27% respectively.
    Geographically, Waters Division sales in the U.S., Europe and
    Asia (including Japan) strengthened approximately 4%, 12% and
    19%, respectively, in 2006. The effects of foreign currency
    translation increased sales growth by 2% in Europe and decreased
    sales growth in Asia by 3% in 2006. The growth in Europe was
    broad-based across most major countries, particularly in Eastern
    Europe, while Asia’s growth was primarily driven by
    increased sales in India and China. U.S. sales growth in
    2006 was primarily due to higher demand from the Company’s
    pharmaceutical and industrial customers.

TA
    Division Net Sales:

TA Division’s sales grew 9% in 2006 as a result of
    TA’s new product introductions and expansion of its Asian
    businesses. Foreign currency translation had no impact to this
    overall sales growth rate. Instrument sales grew 4% as TA
    introduced four new differential scanning calorimeters during
    2006 and, in late August 2006, the Company entered the field of
    microcalorimetry through the acquisition of Thermometrics.
    Instrument system sales represented approximately 70% and 73% of
    sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. TA service sales grew 22%
    in 2006 and



can be attributed to the increased sales of service plans to the
    higher installed base of customers. Geographically, sales growth
    for 2006 was predominantly in Europe and Asia.

Gross
    Profit:

Gross profit for 2006 was $744.0 million compared to
    $679.9 million for 2005, an increase of $64.1 million
    or 9% and is generally consistent with the increase in net
    sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 58.1%
    in 2006 from 58.7% in 2005. The 2006 gross profit was negatively
    impacted by $4.3 million of stock-based compensation costs
    relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The
    remaining slight decrease in gross profit percentage in 2006 as
    compared to 2005 is primarily due to product transition costs to
    Singapore and product introduction costs on new MS instruments.

Selling
    and Administrative Expenses:

Selling and administrative expenses for 2006 and 2005 were
    $357.7 million and $321.7 million, respectively. As a
    percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses
    were 27.9% for 2006 compared to 27.8% for 2005. The
    $36.0 million or 11% increase in total selling and
    administrative expenses for 2006 is primarily due to additional
    stock-based compensation costs of $18.6 million, annual
    merit increases across most divisions, other headcount additions
    and related fringe benefits and indirect costs of
    $11.6 million. Other increases in selling and
    administration expenses were offset by decreases related to the
    February 2006 cost saving initiative. The Company has made
    investments in Asia, largely in the second half of 2006, in
    support of growing business opportunities and management expects
    expenses to continue to grow at a modest rate in the future as
    compared to 2006.

Research
    and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses were $77.3 million for
    2006 and $66.9 million for 2005, an increase of
    $10.4 million or 16% primarily due to stock-based
    compensation costs of $5.1 million relating to the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123(R)and the merit increases across most
    divisions, other headcount additions and related fringe benefits
    and indirect costs. The remaining increases in research and
    development expenses in 2006 as compared to 2005 reflects the
    costs of introducing multiple new MS instruments in the second
    half of 2006.

    Restructuring:

In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan
    primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe that
    resulted in the employment of 74 employees being terminated, all
    of which had left the Company as of December 31, 2006. In
    addition, the Company closed a sales and demonstration office in
    the Netherlands in the second quarter of 2006. The Company
    implemented this cost reduction plan primarily to realign its
    operating costs with business opportunities around the world.

The following is a summary of activity of the Company’s
    2006 restructuring liability (in thousands):

The Company does not expect to incur any additional charges
    connection with the February 2006 restructuring initiative. The
    Company achieved approximately $4.4 million of cost savings
    in 2006 from this initiative, mostly in the second half of 2006,
    and expects to achieve approximately $7.4 million in cost
    savings annually as a result of this restructuring. Other
    charges include approximately $0.7 million of leasehold
    improvement assets, net of accumulated amortization, written-off
    as a result of the closure of the facility in the Netherlands.

Litigation
    Provisions:

Litigation provisions in 2005 were $3.1 million relating to
    patent litigation with Agilent Corporation and Hewlett-Packard
    Company (“Hewlett-Packard”). This patent litigation
    was settled in February 2006 and recorded in the
    2005 statement of operations. No additional provisions were
    made in 2006.



Other
    (Expense) Income, Net:

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
    $5.8 million charge for an

other-than-temporary

impairment to an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals
    Inc. (“Caprion”). The charge was recorded in 2006 when
    the Company learned that Caprion’s financial condition had
    deteriorated and a merger was in process that, in the
    Company’s assessment, would result in the Company’s
    investment being substantially diminished. The remaining value
    of the Caprion investment was approximately $1.7 million as
    of December 31, 2006.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company sold all of its
    equity investment in Nuvelo, Inc. and recorded a gain of
    $1.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company
    also recorded a $4.8 million charge for an

other-than-temporary

impairment for the full value of the Company’s investment
    in Beyond Genomics, Inc. This charge was recorded based on the
    Company’s assessment of Beyond Genomics, Inc.’s
    financial condition.

Interest
    Expense:

Interest expense was $51.7 million and $24.7 million
    for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2006 interest
    expense is primarily attributable to increases in interest rates
    on the Company’s outstanding debt and an increase in
    average borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase
    programs.

Interest
    Income:

Interest income for 2006 and 2005 was $25.3 million and
    $19.3 million, respectively. The increase in interest
    income is primarily due to higher interest rate yields.

Provision
    for Income Taxes:

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were
    15.5% and 26.4%, respectively. Included in the
    2005 effective tax rate is the effect of $24.0 million
    of income tax expense related to the repatriation of funds from
    the Company’s foreign subsidiaries under the ACJA. The
    remaining decrease in the effective tax rates for
    2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to the
    proportionate increase in income in international jurisdictions
    with lower effective tax rates, primarily Ireland and Singapore.
    In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted
    in the recognition of a tax benefit at a higher effective tax
    rate in 2006.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2004

Net
    Sales:

Net sales in 2005 were $1,158.2 million, an increase of 5%
    compared to sales of $1,104.5 million in 2004. Foreign
    currency translation had no significant effect overall on sales
    growth in 2005. In 2005, product sales increased
    $27.9 million or 3% and service sales increased
    $25.8 million or 9% over sales in 2004. The increase in
    product sales is primarily due to the continued strength of LC,
    MS and TA instrument sales growth, increases in sales of
    chemistry consumables and, particularly, the full-year sales in
    2005 of the ACQUITY UPLC system. The increase in service sales
    is primarily due to growth in the Company’s instrument
    installed base and sales of service contracts.

Waters
    Division Net Sales:

Waters Division’s sales in 2005 grew approximately 4%. The
    effect of foreign currency translation decreased overall sales
    by 1%. The growth in LC and MS instrument system sales in 2005
    was 2%. This growth was due principally to the full-year impact
    of products introduced in 2004, such as the ACQUITY UPLC
    instrument, in combination with demand for existing LC
    instruments, and an increase in Q-Tof Premier and Quattro
    Premier XE system sales substantially offset by weak single
    quadrupole and magnetic sector instrument sales. In 2005, the
    sales of chemistry consumables (sample preparation devices and
    chromatography columns) grew 8% primarily as a result of
    continued strength in demand from the introduction of the new
    XBridge,
    SunFire

tm

and ACQUITY UPLC chromatography columns and Oasis sample
    preparation cartridges. Service sales in 2005 grew 8% over 2004
    due to increased sales of service plans to the Company’s
    growing installed base of customers. Service sales growth was
    geographically broad-based and was driven by increased demand,
    primarily from large multi-national customers, for service plans
    to maintain a higher percentage of their installed Waters
    instruments and their newly purchased Waters instruments. The
    2005 Waters Division sales product mix for instruments,
    chemistry and service was approximately 57%, 16% and 27%,
    respectively. The 2004 Waters Division sales product mix for
    instruments, chemistry and service was approximately 59%, 14%
    and 27%, respectively.



Geographically, Waters Division sales grew 10% in Asia and 7% in
    Japan while the U.S. and European sales grew 1% and 3%,
    respectively. Foreign currency translation had no significant
    impact on sales growth in 2005; except in Japan where sales were
    negatively impacted by 3%. Sales growth rates in Asia and Japan
    were driven by business associated with pharmaceutical industry
    demand in India and more broad-based growth in China. Increased
    regulations for food and drinking water testing also contributed
    to sales growth in Japan and in Asia.

TA
    Division Net Sales:

Sales for thermal analysis instruments, rheometry instruments
    and related service sales grew 8% in 2005. Instrument system
    sales grew 6% as strong demand for TA products from customers
    outside of the U.S. contributed to the division’s
    overall sales growth. Instrument system sales represented
    approximately 73% of sales in 2005 and 2004. Sales growth for TA
    outside of the U.S. was 13% in 2005 compared to 2004.
    TA’s positive sales growth performance can be attributed to
    the strong demand for TA’s products in Japan and Asia and
    TA’s worldwide expanded sales and marketing efforts. Sales
    in the U.S. and Europe grew 3% while sales in Japan and Asia
    grew 20% and 39% in 2005, respectively. In 2005, service sales
    grew approximately 15% primarily as a result of providing
    service to a larger installed base of instruments.

Gross
    Profit:

Gross profit for 2005 was $679.9 million compared to
    $649.7 million for 2004, an increase of $30.2 million
    or 5% and generally consistent with the increase in net sales.
    Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 58.7% in 2005
    from 58.8% in 2004. The slight decline in gross profit
    percentage is primarily attributable to a higher mix of more
    costly new products, in particular the ACQUITY UPLC instrument,
    as well as lower sales of higher margin MS instruments. These
    factors negatively affecting gross profit percentage were
    partially offset by an increased mix of higher margin chemistry
    consumables and service sales.

Selling
    and Administrative Expenses:

Selling and administrative expenses for 2005 and 2004 were
    $321.7 million and $300.2 million, respectively. As a
    percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses
    increased to 27.8% for 2005 from 27.2% for 2004. The
    $21.5 million or 7% increase in total selling and
    administrative expenses for 2005 is primarily attributable to
    the following: an increase of approximately $4.1 million as
    a result of foreign currency effects; annual merit increases and
    other headcount additions and related fringe benefits and
    indirect costs of approximately $15.4 million; an increase
    in travel expenses of approximately $6.4 million; and an
    increase in expenses associated with a new building in Milford,
    Massachusetts acquired in 2004. The impact of these increases
    was primarily offset by lower sales commissions and management
    incentive compensation expense derived from 2005 financial
    results.

Research
    and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses were $66.9 million for
    2005 and $65.2 million for 2004, an increase of
    $1.7 million or 3%. The increase is primarily attributable
    to an increase in headcount as the Company continues to invest
    in the development of new and improved LC, MS, thermal analysis
    and rheometry products.

Litigation
    Provisions and Settlement:

Net litigation settlements and provisions for 2005 were a
    $3.1 million charge compared to a $9.3 million net
    benefit for 2004. In 2005, the Company recorded a provision of
    $3.1 million relating to patent litigation with
    Hewlett-Packard. This patent litigation was settled in February
    2006. In 2004, the Company recorded the benefit of a litigation
    judgment in the amount of $17.1 million and a provision
    expense of $7.8 million. The benefit in 2004 is related to
    the conclusion of the Company’s litigation with
    Perkin-Elmer. The provision in 2004 was related to the on-going
    patent infringement suit with Hewlett-Packard. In 2005, the
    Company made payments for legal fees regarding the
    Hewlett-Packard litigation in the amount of approximately
    $2.3 million.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Asset:

In 2004, the Company recorded a $4.0 million charge for an

other-than-temporary

impairment of its technology license with Sandia National
    Laboratories, as a significant portion of the technology
    collaboration program was suspended. There was no such charge in
    2005. The remaining value of the license was approximately
    $0.8 million and $1.0 million as of December 31,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.



Other
    (Expense) Income, Net:

In 2005, the Company sold all of its equity investment in
    Nuvelo, Inc. and recorded a gain of $1.7 million. In 2005,
    the Company also recorded a $4.8 million charge for an

other-than-temporary

impairment for the full value of the Company’s investment
    in Beyond Genomics, Inc. This charge was recorded based on the
    Company’s assessment of Beyond Genomics, Inc.’s
    financial condition. In 2004, the Company recorded a
    $1.0 million pre-tax charge for an

other-than-temporary

impairment to the Company’s remaining investment carrying
    value of
    GeneProt

tm

.

This
    charge was recorded based on the Company’s assessment of
    GeneProt’s financial condition.

Interest
    Expense:

Interest expense was $24.7 million and $10.1 million
    for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 interest
    expense is primarily attributable to a combination of additional
    borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase
    programs and higher interest rates on the Company’s
    outstanding debt.

Interest
    Income:

Interest income for 2005 and 2004 was $19.3 million and
    $11.9 million, respectively. The increase in interest
    income is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher
    interest rate yields.

Provision
    for Income Taxes:

In October 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA creates
    a temporary incentive for U.S. multi-national corporations
    to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an 85%
    dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
    controlled foreign corporations. It previously had been the
    Company’s practice to permanently reinvest all foreign
    earnings into foreign operations. On July 12, 2005, the
    Board of Directors of the Company approved the repatriation of
    $500.0 million as a qualified distribution in accordance
    with the AJCA. The Company has used and will continue to use the
    repatriated cash to fund current and future operating expenses
    within the parameters of Internal Revenue Service guidance.
    During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a tax
    liability of $24.0 million for the federal, state and
    foreign taxes related to the qualified and base period
    distribution in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes”.

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were
    26.4% and 21.6%, respectively. Included in the 2005 effective
    tax rate is the effect of $24.0 million of income tax
    expense related to the repatriation of funds from the
    Company’s foreign subsidiaries under the AJCA. The 2004
    effective tax rate was impacted by the net tax effect of the
    Perkin-Elmer litigation judgment received and the litigation
    provisions for the on-going patent infringement suit with
    Hewlett-Packard. The remaining change in effective tax rates is
    primarily attributable to the relative increase in income in
    international jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates,
    primarily Ireland.

Cash Flow
    from Operating Activities

Year
    Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2005

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $263.6 million and $298.1 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The $34.5 million decline in net cash
    provided from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is
    attributed primarily to the following significant changes in the
    sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities,
    aside from the increase in net income and the impact of stock
    compensation under SFAS 123(R):

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2006 compared to 2005 is
    primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by
    customers and the higher sales volume in 2006 as compared to
    2005. The days-sales-outstanding (“DSO”) decreased to
    64 days at December 31, 2006 from 70 days at
    December 31, 2005.

•

The change in inventory in 2006 compared to 2005 results from
    the increase in inventory due to the

ramp-up

of
    new MS products, an increase in LC instrument inventory
    associated with the transition to higher production levels of
    ACQUITY systems from Alliance systems and a planned increase in
    the Alliance inventory levels during the outsourcing transition.

•

The 2006 change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities was impacted by cash payments made on increased
    inventory levels, severance and other facility related payments
    of $7.0 million in connection with the cost reduction
    initiative and a litigation payment of $3.5 million to
    settle the Hewlett-Packard litigation.

•

Also included in the change in accounts payable and other
    current liabilities in 2006 was a tax payment in the amount of
    $9.0 million related to the distribution and repatriation
    of cash under the AJCA. During 2005, the income tax accrual was
    increased by $24.0 million resulting from the repatriation
    of funds under the AJCA.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in
    both 2006 and 2005 was a result of the installed base of
    customers renewing annual service contracts.

•

2006 net cash provided by operating activities as compared
    to 2005 was impacted by the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Under SFAS No. 123(R),
    $16.5 million of benefits of tax deductions in excess of
    recognized compensation costs were reported as cash from
    financing activities in 2006; prior to the adoption



of SFAS No. 123(R), this benefit of $4.9 million
    in 2005 was reported as part of cash from operating activities.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2004

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $298.1 million and $259.4 million in 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The $38.7 million increase in the net cash
    provided from operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 can
    be attributed primarily to the following significant changes in
    the sources and uses of the net cash provided from operating
    activities, aside from the increase in net income:

•

Depreciation and amortization have increased as a result of
    higher capital spending on equipment and facilities, and the
    full-year impact of acquisitions, particularly in 2004.

•

Deferred income taxes decreased in 2005 primarily as a result of
    the utilization of a portion of the net operating loss
    carryforwards.

•

The change in accounts receivable is primarily related to the
    timing of the Company’s sales within the quarter, the
    timing of cash receipts from customers and foreign currency
    translation. DSO at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were
    70 days and 76 days, respectively.

•

The growth in inventory over the two years is primarily related
    to the Company’s sales growth and the introduction of new
    products. Although inventory levels have grown, they have not
    increased at the same rate as sales growth, thus resulting in
    improved inventory turns of 3.6 and 3.3 in 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

•

The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities
    are primarily related to the increase in income tax accruals
    resulting from the repatriation of funds in 2005 and timing of
    payments of income tax, compensation, and retirement accruals.

•

The 2005 change in accrued litigation is attributed to payment
    of legal fees directly associated with existing litigation
    accruals and a provision of $3.1 million relating to patent
    litigation with Hewlett-Packard, which was settled in February
    2006. The 2004 change in accrued litigation of
    $16.1 million is primarily due to the $18.1 million
    payment to Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments for the
    settlement of a patent litigation matter and a $7.8 million
    provision offset by approximately $4.1 million of payments
    in connection with the Hewlett-Packard patent litigation matter.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in
    both 2005 and 2004 was a result of the installed base of
    customers renewing annual service contracts.

Cash Used
    in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities totaled
    $130.4 million in 2006 compared to $51.0 million in
    2005 and $108.6 million in 2004. Additions to fixed assets
    and intangible assets were $51.4 million in 2006,
    $51.0 million in 2005 and $66.2 million in 2004.
    Included in 2004 was a building purchase adjacent to the
    Company’s headquarters in Milford, Massachusetts for
    $18.1 million, as well as approximately $3.2 million
    of costs in

construction-in-progress

related to improvements made to the building. Aside from the
    purchase of this building, fixed asset and intangible asset
    additions were consistent with capital spending trends and
    expectations throughout the respective years to accommodate the
    Company’s growth. Business acquisitions were
    $79.0 million and $42.4 million in 2006 and 2004,
    respectively. There were no business acquisitions in 2005.

Cash Used
    in Financing Activities

During 2006, the Company’s net change in debt borrowings
    was a $72.2 million increase compared to a
    $369.6 million increase in 2005 and a $210.4 million
    increase in 2004. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had
    $885.0 million borrowed under two existing credit
    agreements and an amount available to borrow of
    $163.4 million after outstanding letters of credit. In
    total, $500.0 million of the total debt was classified as
    long-term debt and $385.0 million classified as short-term
    debt at December 31, 2006 in the consolidated balance
    sheets. The remaining amount of short-term debt of
    $18.5 million at December 31, 2006 consists of various
    local lines of credit throughout the Company’s worldwide
    subsidiaries.



The Company repurchased 5.8 million, 15.4 million and
    5.5 million common stock shares at a cost of
    $249.2 million, $659.3 million and $231.3 million
    during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, under previously
    announced stock repurchase programs. On October 24, 2005,
    the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
    repurchase up to an additional $500.0 million of its
    outstanding common shares over a two-year period. The Company
    has repurchased 11.3 million shares at a cost of
    $465.3 million under this new program through
    December 31, 2006, leaving $34.7 million authorized
    for repurchases in the future. The Company believes that these
    share repurchase programs benefit shareholders by increasing
    earnings per share through reducing the outstanding shares while
    maintaining adequate financial flexibility given current cash
    and debt levels. The Company received $39.9 million,
    $16.8 million and $45.0 million of proceeds from the
    exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to
    employee stock purchase plans in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Proceeds from stock options exercised in 2004 were
    unusually high due to significant exercises of stock options
    related to previously granted options about to expire.

The Company believes that the cash and cash equivalent balance
    of $514.2 million at the end of 2006 and expected cash flow
    from operating activities, together with borrowing capacity from
    committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund working
    capital, capital spending requirements, authorized share
    repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final
    determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve
    months. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that
    its financial position, along with expected future cash flows
    from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to
    raise funds from a number of financing alternatives and external
    sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating and
    investing needs for the foreseeable future.

On January 11, 2007, Waters Corporation and Waters
    Technologies Ireland Ltd. entered into a new credit agreement
    (the “2007 Credit Agreement”). The 2007 Credit
    Agreement provides for a $500 million term loan facility, a
    $350 million revolving facility
    (“U.S. Tranche”), which includes both a letter of
    credit and a swingline subfacility, and a $250 million
    revolving facility (“European Tranche”) that is
    available to Waters Corporation in U.S. dollars and Waters
    Technologies Ireland Ltd. in either U.S. dollars or Euro.
    Waters Corporation may on one or more occasions request of the
    lender group that commitments for the U.S. Tranche or
    European Tranche be increased by an amount of not less than
    $25 million, up to an aggregate additional amount of
    $250 million. Existing lenders are not obligated to
    increase commitments and the Company can seek to bring in
    additional lenders. The term loan facility and the revolving
    facilities both mature on January 11, 2012 and require no
    scheduled prepayments before that date.

On January 11, 2007, the Company borrowed $500 million
    under the new term loan facility, $115 million under the
    new European Tranche, and $270 million under the new
    U.S. Tranche revolving facility. The Company used the
    proceeds of the term loan and the revolving borrowings to repay
    the outstanding amounts under the Company’s existing
    multi-borrower credit agreement dated as of December 15,
    2004 and amended as of October 12, 2005 and the
    Company’s existing term loan agreement dated as of
    November 28, 2005. Waters Corporation terminated such
    agreements early without penalty.

The interest rates applicable to term loan and revolving loans
    under the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s
    option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of
    the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus

1/2%)

or the
    applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate,
    in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the
    Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between
    33 basis points and 72.5 basis points. The facility
    fee on the 2007 Credit Agreement ranges between 7 basis
    points and 15 basis points. The 2007 Credit Agreement
    requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio
    test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not
    more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal
    quarters, respectively, the same as the terminated credit
    agreements. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes
    negative covenants that are customary for investment grade
    credit facilities and are similar in nature to ones contained in
    the terminated credit agreements. The 2007 Credit Agreement also
    contains certain customary representations and warranties,
    affirmative covenants and events of default which are similar in
    nature to those in the terminated credit agreements.

Commitments:

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third
    parties which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid
    for licenses were approximately $0.6 million in 2006,
    $0.8 million in 2005 and $1.1 million in 2004. Future
    minimum licenses fees payable under existing license agreements
    as of December 31, 2006 are immaterial.

The interest rates applicable to any U.S. borrowings under
    the existing credit agreement and term loan and revolving loans
    under the existing credit agreement are, at the Company’s
    option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of
    the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus


/


%)
    or, on any Euro borrowings, the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6,
    9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest
    rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which
    can range between 37.5 basis points and 112.5 basis
    points. At current and long-term debt and interest rate levels
    consistent with those at December 31, 2006, the
    Company’s interest expense would be approximately
    $52.0 million annually. This amount considers the credit
    margins under the 2007 Credit Agreement mentioned above.

(2)

Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of
    business.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
    in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
    business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
    its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
    individually or in the aggregate, with the exception of the
    current litigation described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings,
    will not be material to the financial position or results of
    operations.

The Company has long-term liabilities for deferred employee
    compensation, including pension and supplemental executive
    retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental
    retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent
    upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether
    the employee elects lump-sum or annuity payments. During fiscal
    year 2007, the Company expects to contribute approximately
    $4.0 million to $8.0 million to the Company’s
    pension plans. Capital expenditures in 2007 are expected to be
    at similar levels expended in 2006 to support the growth in the
    business.

The Company is not aware of any undisclosed risks and
    uncertainties, including, but not limited to, product technical
    obsolescence, regulatory compliance, protection of intellectual
    property rights, changes in pharmaceutical industry spending,
    competitive advantages, current and pending litigation, and
    changes in foreign exchanges rates, that are reasonably likely
    to occur and could materially and negatively affect the
    Company’s existing cash balance or its ability to borrow
    funds from its credit facility. The Company also believes there
    are no provisions in its credit facilities, its real estate
    leases, or supplier and collaborative agreements that would
    accelerate payments, require additional collateral or impair its
    ability to continue to enter into critical transactions. The
    Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any
    dividends in the foreseeable future.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Company has not created, and is not party to, any
    special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of
    raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its
    business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the
    Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated
    financial statements. The Company has not entered into any
    transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has
    subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other
    contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material
    continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other
    obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity
    that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk
    support to the Company.



Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Summary:

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires
    the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
    and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical
    accounting policies are those that are central to the
    presentation of the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations that require management to make estimates
    about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a
    material impact on the Company’s results of operations
    given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to
    occur from period to period or use of different estimates that
    reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an
    ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates.
    The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
    various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements that require
    estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above.
    Changes in estimates used in these and other items could
    potentially have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition:

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
    product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
    Partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or
    performance of service is recorded as deferred revenue in the
    consolidated balance sheets. Once the product is shipped, all
    advance payments received associated with that particular order
    are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the
    customer invoice. Shipping and handling costs are included in
    cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the
    order. The Company’s products generally carry one year of
    warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once
    the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a
    service contract. Service contract billings are generally
    invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term,
    and revenue is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
    contract term. At December 31, 2006, the Company had
    current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities of
    approximately $76.1 million and $10.5 million,
    respectively.

Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
    evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
    until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
    specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted
    accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility
    is not reasonably assured. The Company’s method of revenue
    recognition for certain products requiring installation is in
    accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”)
    104, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.”
    Accordingly, revenue is recognized when all of the following
    criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred, the vendor’s fee is fixed or
    determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured and, if
    applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with
    contractual cash holdback are specified. With respect to
    installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash
    holdback or the fair value of the installation service is
    deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized
    as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete.
    The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon
    a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates,
    estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged
    by third parties. The Company believes that this amount
    approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the
    installation effort.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with Statement
    of Position (“SOP”)

No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition”, as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions”. Nearly all of the Company’s instruments
    contain embedded operating system and data management software,
    which is included in the purchase price. Software is also sold
    separately and revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically
    no significant post-delivery obligations remain. Software
    upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with
    revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.



Loss
    Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory:

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
    to make required payments. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
    impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
    allowances may be required. The Company does not request
    collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced
    through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit.
    The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors
    including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the
    customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends
    and the macro-economic environment. Sales returns and allowances
    are estimates of future product returns related to current
    period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount
    and timing of revenue for any period if management made
    different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales
    returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company’s
    accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006 was
    $272.2 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and
    sales returns of $8.4 million. Historically, the Company
    has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
    or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis (“FIFO”). The Company estimates
    revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical
    obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand,
    including that in the Company’s current backlog of orders,
    and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or
    market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional write-downs may be required. The
    Company’s inventory balance at December 31, 2006 was
    $168.4 million, net of write-downs to net realizable value
    of $14.3 million.

Long-Lived
    Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill:

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles,
    long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could
    trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the
    following:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
    projected future operating results;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends; and

•

significant changes or developments in strategic technological
    collaborations or legal matters which affect the Company’s
    capitalized patent, trademark and intellectual properties such
    as licenses.

When the Company determines that the carrying value of
    intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill may not be
    recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above
    indicators, it measures any impairment based on a projected
    discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by
    management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the
    Company’s current business model. In 2004, the Company
    recorded a $4.0 million charge for an

other-than-temporary

impairment of its technology licenses with Sandia National
    Laboratories as a significant portion of the technology
    collaboration program was suspended. Net intangible assets,
    long-lived assets, and goodwill amounted to $131.7 million,
    $149.3 million, and $265.2 million, respectively, as
    of December 31, 2006. The Company performs annual
    impairment reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its
    annual review during 2006 and currently does not expect to
    record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. However,
    there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are
    completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded.

Warranty:

Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
    engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
    including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its
    component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is
    affected by product failure rates, material usage and service
    delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should
    actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery
    costs differ from the Company’s previous estimates,
    revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
    At December 31, 2006, the Company’s warranty liability
    was $12.6 million.



Income
    Taxes:

As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes
    in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process
    involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure
    together with assessing temporary differences resulting from
    differing treatment of items, such as depreciation,
    amortization, and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting
    purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance
    sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these
    estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future
    periods, the Company may need to establish an additional
    valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial
    position and results of operations.

SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”,
    requires that a Company continually evaluate the necessity of
    establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax
    assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that
    actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future
    periods.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had determined that it
    was more likely than not that the actual tax benefit of
    $167.5 million of its deferred tax assets would not be
    realized. The Company had therefore recorded a cumulative
    $167.5 million valuation allowance to reduce the net
    carrying value of these assets to zero for financial reporting
    purposes as of December 31, 2004. The valuation allowance
    was determined based on the Company’s review of its future
    estimated U.S. taxable income levels and the estimated
    future stock option exercises. Included in this
    $167.5 million valuation allowance was $154.9 million
    related to the future tax benefit of U.S. net operating
    losses generated by the exercise of non-qualified stock options.
    As required by SFAS No. 109 and APB Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees”, the Company had originally recorded all
    $154.9 million of these future tax benefits as increased
    additional paid-in capital. Accordingly, when the Company
    recorded a valuation allowance against these future tax
    benefits, the Company also reduced additional paid-in capital by
    $154.9 million.

As required by SFAS No. 109, the Company maintained
    this deferred tax asset valuation allowance until it determined,
    during 2005, that it was more likely than not that it would
    realize the actual tax benefit of $92.5 million of deferred
    tax assets for which a full valuation allowance had been
    previously provided. The Company made this determination based
    on the level of the Company’s actual 2005 U.S. taxable
    income, the Company’s projected future U.S. taxable
    income levels, the Company’s actual 2005 tax deduction from
    the exercise of non-qualified stock options and the fact that
    the Company’s future tax deduction from the exercise of
    non-qualified stock options would most likely be less than in
    the past as those options, which were significantly

in-the-money,

were expiring and exercised by December 31, 2005. The
    Company therefore recorded, in 2005, a $92.5 million
    reduction in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Because
    this reduction in the valuation allowance included
    $78.8 million related to the future tax benefit of
    U.S. net operating losses generated by the exercise of
    non-qualified stock options, the Company also restored
    $78.8 million to the Company’s additional paid-in
    capital in 2005, in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and
    APB No. 25. The remaining balance was credited to goodwill
    related to an acquisition the Company made in 2004. The Company
    made the determination based on a review of the facts and
    circumstances at that time.

Litigation:

As described in Item 3 of Part I of this

Form 10-K,

the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters.
    With respect to each pending claim, management determines
    whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable
    and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when
    management has determined, with respect to a particular claim,
    both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate
    the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to
    either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in
    that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose
    additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to
    considerable interpretation.

With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management
    of the Company to date has been able to make this determination,
    and thus has recorded charges, with respect to the claims
    described under the heading “Hewlett-Packard Company.”
    As developments occur in these matters and additional
    information becomes available, management of the Company will
    reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which
    may result in its recording charges or additional charges, which
    could materially impact the Company’s results of operation
    or financial position.



Pension
    and Other Retirement Benefits:

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
    and the fair values of plan assets for the Company’s
    pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated
    periodically by management in consultation with outside
    actuaries and investment advisors. Changes in assumptions are
    based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as
    the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and
    the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are
    evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.00%
    for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which is the
    majority of the Company’s benefit obligation and expense.

At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount
    rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined
    the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and
    Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments
    and the Moody’s Aa interest rate as of December 31,
    2006 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash
    flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once
    the interest rates were determined, the plan’s cash flow
    was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement
    date. At December 31, 2006, the Company determined this
    rate to be 5.82% for the Company’s U.S. defined
    benefit pension plan, which is the majority of the
    Company’s 2006 benefit obligation and 2007 expense.
    Retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those
    used by the Company’s defined benefit pension plan in
    accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
    other than Pensions.”

A one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate
    would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for
    the U.S. pension plan by approximately $0.4 million. A
    one-quarter percentage point change in the assumed long-term
    rate of return would impact the Company’s net periodic
    benefit cost for the U.S. pension plan by approximately
    $0.2 million.

Stock-based
    Compensation:

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
    Payment”, on January 1, 2006. This standard requires
    that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the
    statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company
    has used the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of
    its stock option awards. Under the fair value recognition
    provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is
    measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and
    is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining
    the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires
    judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and
    employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results
    differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based
    compensation expense and the Company’s results of
    operations could be materially impacted. As stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements
    of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to
    vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated
    forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to
    be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
    subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical
    experience. If factors change and the Company employs different
    assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R), the
    compensation expense that the Company records in the future
    periods may differ significantly from what the Company has
    recorded in the current period.

The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method
    permitted under SFAS No. 123(R) and consequently has
    not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified
    transition method, compensation costs associated with awards for
    2006 now include expense relating to the remaining unvested
    awards granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense
    related to any awards issued subsequent to December 31,
    2005. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line
    attribution method.

The after-tax stock-based compensation and the impact to diluted
    earnings per share of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 were $20.6 million with a
    $0.20 per share reduction to diluted earnings per share,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has
    capitalized stock-based compensation costs of $0.6 million
    and $1.0 million to inventory and capitalized software,
    respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. Prior to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company used the
    intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by APB
    No. 25 and related interpretations, including Financial
    Interpretation (“FIN”) 44, “Accounting for
    Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation”, for its
    plans. Under this accounting method, stock-option compensation
    awards that are granted with the exercise price at the current
    fair



value of the Company’s common stock as of the date of the
    award generally did not require compensation expense to be
    recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
    Stock-based compensation expense recognized for the
    Company’s fixed employee stock option plans, restricted
    stock and employee stock purchase plan was $0.8 million in
    2005. The 2005 stock-based compensation expense amounts were all
    recorded in selling and administrative expenses.

As of December 31, 2006, unrecognized compensation costs
    and related weighted-average lives over which the costs will be
    amortized were as follows (in millions):

Recent
    Accounting Standards Changes

In January 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment”, and SAB 107,
    “Share-Based Payment”. These standards require that
    all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
    employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of
    operations based on their fair values. The adoption of these
    standards did have a material effect on the Company’s
    financial position and results of operations. See Note 13,
    Stock-Based Compensation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information.

In January 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”, which
    replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting
    Changes”, and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting
    Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements”, and
    changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of
    a change in accounting principles. This Statement requires
    retrospective application to prior periods’ financial
    statements of changes in accounting principles, unless it is
    impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or
    the cumulative effect of the change. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 154 did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In January 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs”, which amends Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 43 Chapter 4. This standard
    clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
    freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should
    be recognized as current period charges and requires the
    allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on
    the normal capacity of the production facilities. The adoption
    of this standard did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 155,
    “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
    Instruments — an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 133 and 140”. This standard permits fair value
    remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains
    an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation;
    clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips
    are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133;
    requires evaluation of interests in securitized financial
    assets; clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form
    of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and eliminates
    the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from
    holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a
    beneficial interest other than another derivative financial
    instrument. This standard is effective for all financial
    instruments acquired or issued for fiscal years beginning after
    September 15, 2006. The Company does not believe that
    adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have a material effect
    on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”. This
    interpretation prescribes new methodology by which a company
    must measure, report, present, and disclose in its financial
    statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting
    positions that a company has taken or expects to take. The
    interpretation requires financial



statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of
    uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that
    all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of the tax
    reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of these effects
    for the time value of money. In addition, the interpretation
    also mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about
    uncertainty in tax reporting positions. The interpretation will
    become effective in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is
    still evaluating the impact of this interpretation on its
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”. This standard addresses how
    companies should measure fair value when they are required to
    use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes
    under generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”). This standard is effective for all financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. The Company is in the process of
    evaluating whether this standard will have a material effect on
    its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
    Postretirement Plans”, which amends SFAS No. 87,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”,
    SFAS No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans
    and for Termination Benefits”, SFAS No. 106,
    “Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
    Than Pensions”, and SFAS No. 132(R),
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
    Postretirement Benefits”. This standard requires an
    employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of
    defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit
    plans, previously disclosed in the footnotes to the financial
    statements, as an asset or liability in its statement of
    financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
    status in the year in which the changes occur through
    comprehensive income. This standard also requires an employer to
    measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year
    end statement of financial position. In addition, this statement
    will require disclosure of the effects of the unrecognized gains
    or losses, prior service costs and transition asset or
    obligation on the next fiscal year’s net periodic benefit
    cost. This standard is effective for all financial statements
    issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006 and
    retrospective application of this standard is not permitted. The
    adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position. See Note 16, Retirement
    Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information as to the impact of adopting this
    pronouncement.

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements”. This standard addresses quantifying the
    financial statement effect of misstatements, specifically, how
    the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered
    in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial
    statements. This standard is effective for fiscal years ending
    after November 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard did
    not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 7a:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its
    exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes
    other than trading, in accordance with the Company’s
    overall risk management guidelines.

The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange-rate risk
    with respect to certain inter-company balances, forecasted
    transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro,
    Japanese Yen and British Pound. The Company manages its foreign
    currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the
    Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account
    offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the
    Company utilizes derivative and non-derivative financial
    instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency
    fluctuations.

The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and
    cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
    interest rates. The Company’s policy is to manage interest
    costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that
    management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix
    in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered
    into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to
    exchange, at specified



intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest
    amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional
    amount.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
    to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
    related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In
    the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a floating
    to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of
    $200.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to the
    term loan facility of its outstanding debt, with a maturity date
    of June 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the
    Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax realized gain of
    $0.5 million and, in December 2006, the Company closed out
    the swap, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $0.4 million. The
    gain was deferred and will be recognized in earnings in 2007
    over the original term of the interest rate swap. For the year
    ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative
    net pre-tax unrealized loss of $0.2 million in accumulated
    other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a
    floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount
    of $125.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to
    the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt, with a maturity
    date of 21 months. The Company subsequently closed out the
    swap in the second quarter of 2004, with a realized gain of
    $1.6 million. The total pre-tax amount of the gain that was
    recognized in earnings in 2004 was $0.7 million. The
    remaining $0.9 million was recognized in earnings in 2005
    over the original term of the interest rate swap.

Hedges of
    Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
    throughout the world, with approximately 34% of its sales
    denominated in Euros, 11% in Yen and smaller sales exposures in
    other currencies in 2006. As a result, the Company’s
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be
    affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The
    Company uses cross-currency interest rate swaps, forward
    contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its
    stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are
    designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in
    foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value
    of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements, forward
    contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in
    the value of the hedged net assets of the Company’s
    consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these derivative
    instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of
    certain foreign net assets of the Company.

During 2006 and 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in
    Euro foreign affiliates with cross-currency interest rate swaps,
    with notional values ranging from approximately
    $30.0 million to approximately $100.0 million. At
    December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the outstanding
    contracts was approximately $100.0 million. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative
    net pre-tax losses of $11.0 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of
    $9.7 million and unrealized losses of $1.3 million. At
    December 31, 2005, the notional amount of the outstanding
    contracts was approximately $50.0 million. For the year
    ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative
    net pre-tax gains of $0.7 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of
    $0.7 million relating to closed Euro cross-currency
    interest rate swap agreements.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end
    exchange rates (a weakening of the U.S. dollar), the fair
    market value of the cross-currency interest rate swap
    agreements, designated as hedges of net investment in foreign
    operation, as of December 31, 2006, would decrease
    accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately
    $10.0 million.

During 2005 and 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in
    Yen foreign affiliates with Japanese Yen cross-currency interest
    rate swaps, with notional values ranging from approximately
    $26.0 million to approximately $37.0 million. At
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, the notional amounts of the
    outstanding contracts were zero and $37.0 million,
    respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax realized losses of
    $0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on
    the closed Japanese Yen cross-currency interest rate swap
    agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
    Company recorded cumulative pre-tax losses of $2.4 million
    in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of
    realized losses of



$1.6 million related to closed Japanese Yen cross-currency
    interest rate swap agreements and unrealized losses of
    $0.8 million relating to the open Japanese Yen
    cross-currency interest rate swap agreements.

During 2005 and 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in
    British Pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements
    in British Pounds ranging from approximately
    £25.0 million to £75.0 million. Under the
    terms of the agreements, the Company purchases an option below
    the current spot rate to sell British Pounds and sells an option
    to their counterparties above the current spot rate to buy
    British Pounds, with option premiums that offset. At
    December 31, 2005, the Company had range forward agreements
    in British Pounds with a notional amount of
    £30.0 million outstanding. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative net
    pre-tax gain of $6.1 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of
    $5.8 million related to the closed range forward agreements
    and unrealized gains of $0.3 million related to the open
    British Pound range forward agreements. At December 31,
    2004, the Company had no range forward agreements in British
    Pounds outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
    the Company recorded a realized cumulative net pre-tax loss of
    $8.6 million to accumulated other comprehensive income,
    related to the closed range forward agreements.

During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in British
    Pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts
    in British Pounds. At December 31, 2005, the Company had no
    forward exchange contracts in British Pounds used to hedge its
    net investment position. For the year ended December 31,
    2005, the Company recorded a realized gain of $1.6 million.
    For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded
    a cumulative net pre-tax gain of $0.7 million in
    accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of
    realized gains of $0.5 million related to closed forward
    agreements and unrealized gains of $0.2 million related to
    the British Pound forward agreements.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
    principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain inter-company balances. Principal hedged currencies
    include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of
    these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
    and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be
    consistent with changes in inter-company balances. Gains and
    losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
    administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
    operations. At December 31, 2006 and December 31,
    2005, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with
    notional amounts totaling approximately $70.9 million and
    $72.9 million, respectively. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax gains of $3.9 million, which consists of realized
    gains of $2.5 million relating to the closed forward
    contracts and $1.4 million of unrealized gains relating to
    the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31,
    2005, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $0.5 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $1.5 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1.0 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
    the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $4.6 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $4.5 million on closed forward contracts and a
    $0.1 million of unrealized gains on the open forward
    contracts.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end
    exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the
    fair market value of the forward contracts, as of
    December 31, 2006, would decrease earnings by approximately
    $7.1 million.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations
    from the investments of cash generated from operations. The
    Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments, with weighted-average original maturities of
    90 days or less, in commercial paper, bank deposits,
    repurchase agreements and money market funds. Cash equivalents
    are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an
    insignificant risk of change in value. The Company periodically
    maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of
    federally insured limits.



Item 8:

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2006.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
    herein.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of Waters Corporation’s
    consolidated financial statements and of its internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
    audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    related consolidated statements of operations, of
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and of cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
    the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
    an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
    conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
    audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for share-based compensation as of January 1, 2006. As
    discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans
    effective December 31, 2006.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 8, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
    based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.



A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Description
    of Business, Organization and Basis of Presentation

Waters Corporation (“Waters” or the
    “Company”), an analytical instrument manufacturer,
    designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters
    Division, high performance liquid chromatography
    (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography
    (“UPLC” and together with HPLC, herein referred to as
    “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”)
    instrument systems and support products, including
    chromatography columns, other consumable products and
    comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are
    complementary products that can be integrated together and used
    along with other analytical instruments. LC is a standard
    technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to
    detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and
    biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range
    of compounds. MS instruments are used in drug discovery and
    development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of
    proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”)
    and environmental testing. LC is often combined with MS to
    create LC-MS instruments that include a liquid phase sample
    introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric
    compound identification and quantification. Through its TA
    Division (“TA”), the Company designs, manufactures,
    sells and services thermal analysis and rheometry instruments
    which are used in predicting the suitability of polymers and
    viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
    health care products. The Company is also a developer of and
    supplier of software based products that interface with the
    Company’s instruments and are typically purchased by
    customers as part of the instrument system.


Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and
    judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company
    evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
    recognition, product returns and allowances, bad debts,
    inventory valuation, equity investments, goodwill and intangible
    assets, income taxes, warranty and installation provisions,
    retirement plan obligations, stock-based compensation,
    contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on
    historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
    believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
    of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Risks and
    Uncertainties

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the
    analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to,
    development by its competitors of new technological innovations,
    dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of
    proprietary technology, fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates, and compliance with regulations of the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign
    regulatory authorities and agencies.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified in the
    accompanying financial statements in order to be consistent with
    the current year’s classifications.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly
    owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or
    controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All
    material inter-company balances and transactions have been
    eliminated.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and
    liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange
    rates prevailing on the balance sheet date while revenues and
    expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing
    during the period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
    consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s net sales
    derived from operations outside the United States were 68% in
    2006, 66% in 2005 and 65% in 2004. Gains and losses from foreign
    currency transactions are included in net income in the
    consolidated statements of operations and were not material for
    the years presented.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents primarily represent highly liquid investments,
    with original maturities of 90 days or less, in commercial
    paper, bank deposits, repurchase agreements and money market
    funds which are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry
    an insignificant risk of change in value. The Company has
    periodically maintained balances in various operating accounts
    in excess of federally insured limits.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products and services to a significant
    number of large and small customers throughout the world, with
    net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately 52% in
    2006, 54% in 2005 and 54% in 2004. None of the Company’s
    individual customers accounted for more than 3% of annual
    Company sales in 2006, 2005 or 2004. The Company performs
    continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
    does not require collateral, but in certain circumstances may
    require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company
    has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
    the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the
    existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number
    of factors, including historical experience and the
    customer’s credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful
    accounts is reviewed at least on a quarterly basis. Past due
    balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are
    reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are
    charged off against the allowance when the Company feels it is
    probable the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does
    not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its
    customers.

The following is a summary of activity of the Company’s
    allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns for the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands):

Income
    Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences
    between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and
    liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. A



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax
    assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely
    than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures
    for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense while the
    costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation
    is provided using the straight-line method over the following
    estimated useful lives: buildings — fifteen to thirty
    years, building improvements — five to ten years,
    leasehold improvements — the shorter of the economic
    useful life or life of lease, and production and other
    equipment — three to ten years. Upon retirement or
    sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related
    accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated
    balance sheets and related gains or losses are reflected in the
    consolidated statements of operations. There were no material
    gains or losses from retirement or sale of assets in 2006, 2005
    and 2004.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests for goodwill impairment using a fair value
    approach at the reporting unit level annually, or earlier if an
    event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
    not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
    amount. Additionally, the Company has elected to make January 1
    the annual impairment assessment date for its reporting units.
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
    No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”,
    defines a reporting unit as an operating segment, or one level
    below an operating segment, if discrete financial information is
    prepared and reviewed by management. Goodwill is allocated to
    the reporting units at the time of acquisition. Under the
    impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount
    exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is
    recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill
    exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value
    of reporting units were estimated using a discounted cash flows
    technique which includes certain management assumptions, such as
    estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and discount
    rates.

The Company’s intangible assets include purchased
    technology, capitalized software development costs, costs
    associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and
    intellectual properties, such as licenses, and debt issuance
    costs. Purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market
    values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their
    estimated useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years. Other
    intangibles are amortized over a period ranging from one to
    thirteen years. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life
    of the related debt.

Software
    Development Costs

The Company capitalizes software development costs for products
    offered for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 86,
    “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
    Leased, or Otherwise Marketed”. Capitalized costs are
    amortized to cost of sales over the period of economic benefit,
    which approximates a straight-line basis over the estimated
    useful lives of the related software products, generally three
    to five years.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs in
    accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”)

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”. Capitalized internal software
    development costs are amortized over the period of economic
    benefit which approximates a straight-line basis over ten years.
    At December 31, 2006 and 2005, capitalized internal
    software included in property, plant and equipment totaled
    $1.7 million and $2.2 million, net of accumulated
    amortization of $3.6 million and $3.0 million,
    respectively.

Investments

The Company accounts for its investments that represent less
    than twenty percent ownership using SFAS No. 115,
    “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities.” This standard requires that certain debt and
    equity securities be adjusted to market value at the end of each
    accounting period. Unrealized market gains and losses are
    charged to earnings if the securities are traded for short-term
    profit. Otherwise, these securities are

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

investments and unrealized gains and losses are charged or
    credited to other comprehensive income (loss) in
    stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of
    investments are included in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

Investments for which the Company does not have the ability to
    exercise significant influence, and for which there is not a
    readily determinable market value, are accounted for under the
    cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates
    the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the
    cost method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost
    or estimated net realizable value. For investments in which the
    Company owns or controls between twenty and forty-nine percent
    of the voting shares, or over which it exerts significant
    influence over operating and financial policies, the equity
    method of accounting is used. The Company’s share of net
    income or losses of equity investments is included in the
    consolidated statements of operations and was not material in
    any period presented. All investments at December 31, 2006
    and 2005 are included in other assets and amounted to
    $5.3 million and $11.0 million, respectively. There
    were no significant additions in 2006 and see Note 5
    “Business Investments” for other-than temporary
    impairment charges taken in 2006, 2005, and 2004 for a certain
    equity investments.

Asset
    Impairments

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Whenever
    events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
    asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the fair
    value of the asset, relying on a number of factors, including,
    but not limited to, operating results, business plans, economic
    projections and anticipated future cash flows. Any change in the
    carrying amount of an asset as a result of the Company’s
    evaluation is separately identified in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Fair
    Values of Financial Instruments

Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
    accounts payable and debt approximate cost.

Stockholders’
    Equity

On October 24, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million
    of its outstanding common shares over a two-year period. The
    Company has repurchased 11.3 million shares at a cost of
    $465.3 million under this new program through
    December 31, 2006. The Company repurchased
    5.8 million, 15.4 million and 5.5 million common
    stock shares at a cost of $249.2 million,
    $659.3 million and $231.3 million during 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively, under the October 2005 and previously
    announced programs. The Company believes it has the resources to
    fund the common stock repurchases as well as to pursue
    acquisition opportunities in the future.

On August 9, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the
    adoption of a stock purchase rights plan where a dividend of one
    fractional preferred share purchase right (a “Right”)
    was declared for each outstanding share of common stock, par
    value $0.01 per share, of the Company. The dividend was
    paid on August 27, 2002 to the stockholders of record on
    that date. The Rights, which expire on August 27, 2012,
    become exercisable only under certain conditions. When they
    first become exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to
    buy from Waters one one-hundredth of a share of new
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (authorized
    limit of 4,000) for $120.00. When a person or group actually has
    acquired 15% or more of Waters’ common stock, the Rights
    will then become exercisable for a number of shares of
    Waters’ common stock with a market value of twice the
    $120.00 exercise price of each Right. In addition, the Rights
    will then become exercisable for a number of shares of common
    stock of the acquiring company with a market value of twice the
    $120.00 exercise price per Right. The Board of Directors may
    redeem the Rights at a price of $0.001 per Right up until
    10 days following a public announcement that any person or
    group has acquired 15% or more of the Company’s common
    stock.

On February 27, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million
    of its outstanding common shares over a two-year period.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Hedge
    Transactions

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with
    SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities”, as amended, which establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
    including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
    contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether
    designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be
    recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as
    either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as
    a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged
    risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated
    as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the
    fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive
    income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item
    affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value
    are recognized in earnings.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage
    exposures to foreign currency risks. The Company’s
    objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign
    currency risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or
    reduce the impact of foreign currency exposure. The Company
    documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
    hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value,
    cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and
    liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific
    forecasted transactions. The Company also assesses and
    documents, both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing
    basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
    transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
    values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates and interest rates.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
    to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
    related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In
    the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a floating
    to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of
    $200.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to the
    term loan facility of its outstanding debt, with a maturity date
    of June 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the
    Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax realized gain of
    $0.5 million and, in December 2006, the Company closed out
    the swap, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $0.4 million. The
    gain was deferred and will be recognized in earnings in 2007
    over the original term of the interest rate swap. For the year
    ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative
    net pre-tax unrealized loss of $0.2 million in accumulated
    other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a
    floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount
    of $125.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to
    the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt, with a maturity
    date of 21 months. The Company subsequently closed out the
    swap in the second quarter of 2004, with a realized gain of
    $1.6 million. The total pre-tax amount of the gain that was
    recognized in earnings in 2004 was $0.7 million. The
    remaining $0.9 million was recognized in earnings in 2005
    over the original term of the interest rate swap.

Hedges of
    Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
    throughout the world, with approximately 34% of its sales
    denominated in Euros, 11% in Yen and smaller sales exposures in
    other currencies in 2006. As a result, the Company’s
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be
    affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The
    Company uses cross-currency interest rate swaps, forward
    contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its
    stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are
    designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in
    foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value
    of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements, forward
    contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in
    the value of the hedged net assets of the Company’s
    consolidated foreign



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

affiliates. Therefore, these derivative instruments are intended
    to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of
    the Company.

During 2006 and 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in
    Euro foreign affiliates with cross-currency interest rate swaps,
    with notional values ranging from approximately
    $30.0 million to approximately $100.0 million. At
    December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the outstanding
    contracts was approximately $100.0 million. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative
    net pre-tax losses of $11.0 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of
    $9.7 million and unrealized losses of $1.3 million. At
    December 31, 2005, the notional amount of the outstanding
    contracts was approximately $50.0 million. For the year
    ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative
    net pre-tax gains of $0.7 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of
    $0.7 million relating to closed Euro cross-currency
    interest rate swap agreements.

During 2005 and 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in
    Yen foreign affiliates with Japanese Yen cross-currency interest
    rate swaps, with notional values ranging from approximately
    $26.0 million to approximately $37.0 million. At
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, the notional amounts of the
    outstanding contracts were zero and $37.0 million,
    respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax realized losses of
    $0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on
    the closed Japanese Yen cross-currency interest rate swap
    agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
    Company recorded cumulative pre-tax losses of $2.4 million
    in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of
    realized losses of $1.6 million related to closed Japanese
    Yen cross-currency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized
    losses of $0.8 million relating to the open Japanese Yen
    cross-currency interest rate swap agreements.

During 2005 and 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in
    British Pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements
    in British Pounds ranging from approximately
    £25.0 million to £75.0 million. Under the
    terms of the agreements, the Company purchases an option below
    the current spot rate to sell British Pounds and sells an option
    to their counterparties above the current spot rate to buy
    British Pounds, with option premiums that offset. At
    December 31, 2005, the Company had range forward agreements
    in British Pounds with a notional amount of
    £30.0 million outstanding. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative net
    pre-tax gain of $6.1 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of
    $5.8 million related to the closed range forward agreements
    and unrealized gains of $0.3 million related to the open
    British Pound range forward agreements. At December 31,
    2004, the Company had no range forward agreements in British
    Pounds outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
    the Company recorded a realized cumulative net pre-tax loss of
    $8.6 million to accumulated other comprehensive income,
    related to the closed range forward agreements.

During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in British
    Pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts
    in British Pounds. At December 31, 2005, the Company had no
    forward exchange contracts in British Pounds used to hedge its
    net investment position. For the year ended December 31,
    2005, the Company recorded a realized gain of $1.6 million.
    For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded
    a cumulative net pre-tax gain of $0.7 million in
    accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of
    realized gains of $0.5 million related to closed forward
    agreements and unrealized gains of $0.2 million related to
    the British Pound forward agreements.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
    principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain inter-company balances. Principal hedged currencies
    include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of
    these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
    and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be
    consistent with changes in inter-company balances. Gains and
    losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
    administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
    operations. At December 31, 2006 and December 31,
    2005, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with
    notional amounts totaling approximately $70.9 million and
    $72.9 million, respectively. For the year

ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative
    net pre-tax gains of $3.9 million, which consists of
    realized gains of $2.5 million relating to the closed
    forward contracts and $1.4 million of unrealized gains
    relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax gains of $0.5 million, which consists of realized
    gains of $1.5 million relating to the closed forward
    contracts and $1.0 million of unrealized losses relating to
    the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31,
    2004, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $4.6 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $4.5 million on closed forward contracts and a
    $0.1 million of unrealized gains on the open forward
    contracts.

Revenue
    Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
    product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
    Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
    evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
    until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
    specifying fixed terms and prices. Proceeds received in advance
    of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as
    deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Shipping
    and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts
    invoiced to the customer per the order.

The Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain
    products requiring installation is in accordance with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, “Revenue
    Recognition in Financial Statements.” Accordingly, revenue
    is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
    occurred, the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable, and
    collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon
    acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash
    holdback are specified. With respect to installation
    obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the
    fair value of the installation service is deferred when the
    product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple
    element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company
    determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of
    factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated
    installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third
    parties.

The Company recognizes product revenue when legal title has
    transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company
    generally structures its sales arrangements as FOB shipping
    point or international equivalent and accordingly, recognizes
    revenue upon shipment. In some cases, FOB destination based
    shipping terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases
    revenue is recognized when the products arrive at the customer
    site.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and recorded as a
    reduction to sales. Rights of return are generally not included
    in sales arrangements. Revenue associated with products that
    contain specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized
    before the customer acceptance criteria is satisfied. Discounts
    from list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with

SOP No. 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition” as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions”. Nearly all of the Company’s instruments
    contain embedded operating system and data management software,
    which is included in the purchase price. Software is also sold
    separately and revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically
    no significant post-delivery obligations remain. Software
    upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with
    revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.

The Company assists customers in obtaining financing with an
    independent third-party leasing company with respect to certain
    product sales. Revenue is generally recognized upon product
    shipment under these arrangements. The Company receives payment
    from the leasing company shortly after shipment, provided
    delivery and credit documentation meets contractual criteria.
    The customer is obligated to pay the leasing company but the
    Company retains some credit risk if the customer is unable to
    pay. Accordingly, the Company reduces revenue equal to
    pre-established loss-pool criteria, including contracts with
    recourse. The Company’s credit risk is significantly
    reduced through loss-pool limitations and re-marketing rights in
    the event of a default.

Product
    Warranty Costs

The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time
    of sale which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated
    statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive
    product quality programs and processes, including actively
    monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies,
    the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product
    failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs
    incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the
    accrued warranty liability is based on historical information
    such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units
    repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The
    liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s
    accrued warranty liability for the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands):

Advertising
    Costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in
    selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated
    statements of operations. Advertising expenses for 2006, 2005
    and 2004 were $7.9 million, $8.5 million and
    $6.4 million, respectively.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised of costs
    incurred in performing research and development activities
    including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead
    costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and
    development expenses are expensed as incurred.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company has two stock-based compensation plans, which are
    described in Note 13 “Stock-Based Compensation”.

Income
    Per Share

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per
    Share,” the Company presents two earnings per share
    (“EPS”) amounts. Income per basic common share is
    based on income available to common shareholders and the
    weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
    periods presented. Income per diluted common share includes
    additional dilution from potential common stock, such as stock
    issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding.

Comprehensive
    Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with
    SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive
    Income.” The statement establishes standards for reporting
    and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full
    set of general-purpose financial statements. The statement
    requires that all components of comprehensive income be reported
    in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
    prominence as other financial statements.

Recent
    Accounting Standards Changes

In January 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” and SAB 107,
    “Share-Based Payment”. These standards require that
    all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
    employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of
    operations based on their fair values. The adoption of these
    standards did have a material effect on the Company’s
    financial position and results of operations. See Note 13,
    Stock-Based Compensation for additional information.

In January 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”, which
    replaces Accounting Principle Board (“APB”) Opinion
    No. 20, “Accounting Changes”, and
    SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in
    Interim Financial Statements”, and changes the requirements
    for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
    principles. This Statement requires retrospective application to
    prior periods’ financial statements of changes in
    accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine
    either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of
    the change. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have
    a material effect on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs”, which amends Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 43 Chapter 4. This standard
    clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
    freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should
    be recognized as current period charges and requires the
    allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on
    the normal capacity of the production facilities. The adoption
    of this standard did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 155
    (“SFAS No. 155”), “Accounting for
    Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments — an amendment of
    FASB Statements No. 133 and 140”. This standard
    permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial
    instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise
    would require bifurcation; clarifies which interest-only strips
    and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of
    SFAS No. 133; requires evaluation of interests in
    securitized financial assets; clarifies that concentrations of
    credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded
    derivatives; and eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying
    special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial
    instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than
    another derivative financial instrument. This standard is
    effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued for
    fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The
    Company does not believe that adoption of SFAS No. 155
    will have a material effect on its financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”. This
    interpretation prescribes new methodology by which a company
    must measure, report, present, and disclose in its financial
    statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting
    positions that a company has taken or expects to take. The
    interpretation requires financial statement reporting of the
    expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return
    reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax
    authorities possess full knowledge of the tax reporting
    positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of these effects
    for the time value of money. In addition, the interpretation
    also mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about
    uncertainty in tax reporting positions. The interpretation will
    become effective in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is
    still evaluating the impact of this interpretation on its
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”. This standard addresses how
    companies should measure fair value when they are required to
    use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes
    under generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”). This standard is effective for all financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. The Company is in the process of
    evaluating whether this standard will have a material effect on
    its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
    Postretirement Plans”, which amends SFAS No. 87,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”,
    SFAS No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans
    and for Termination Benefits”, SFAS No. 106,
    “Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
    Than Pensions”, and SFAS No. 132(R),
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
    Postretirement Benefits”. This standard requires an
    employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of
    defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit
    plans, previously disclosed in the footnotes to the financial
    statements, as an asset or liability in its statement of
    financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
    status in the year in which the changes occur through
    comprehensive income. This standard also requires an employer to
    measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year
    end statement of financial position. In addition, this statement
    will require disclosure of the effects of the unrecognized gains
    or losses, prior service costs and transition asset or
    obligation on the next fiscal year’s net periodic benefit
    cost. This standard is effective for all financial statements
    issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006 and
    retrospective application of this standard is not permitted. The
    adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position. See Note 16, Retirement
    Plans, for additional information as to the impact of adopting
    this pronouncement.

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements”. This standard addresses quantifying the
    financial statement effect of misstatements, specifically, how
    the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered
    in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial
    statements. This standard is effective for fiscal years ending
    after November 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard did
    not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Business
    Investments

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
    $5.8 million charge for an

other-than-temporary

impairment to an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals
    Inc (“Caprion”). The charge was recorded in 2006 when
    the Company was notified that Caprion’s financial condition
    had deteriorated and that a merger was occurring that, in the
    Company’s assessment, would result in the Company’s
    investment being substantially diminished. The remaining value
    of the Caprion investment is approximately $1.7 million at
    December 31, 2006. In 2005, the Company recorded a
    $4.8 million pre-tax charge for an

other-than-temporary

impairment for the full value of the Company’s investment
    in Beyond Genomics, Inc (“Beyond Genomics”). This
    charge was recorded based on the Company’s assessment of
    Beyond Genomics’ current financial condition and
    uncertainty surrounding their ability to raise necessary funding.

In November 2000 and February 2002, the Company made minority
    equity investments in
    GeneProt

tm

,
    Inc. (“GeneProt”), a privately held company. The
    investment in GeneProt was accounted for under the cost method
    of accounting. To the Company’s knowledge, due to changes
    in GeneProt’s ability to generate enough commercial
    interest to expand its business in the U.S. market, the
    Company recorded pre-tax charges of $1.0 million to other
    income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations
    during the year ended December 31, 2004, for an

other-than-temporary

impairment of its investment in GeneProt. The investment in
    GeneProt is zero at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

In June 2000, the Company formed a strategic alliance with
    Variagenics, Inc. (“Variagenics”), a publicly traded
    company, to develop and commercialize genetic variance reagent
    kits for use in the clinical development of pharmaceutical
    products. Variagenics was considered a leader in applying
    genetic variance information to the drug development process. In
    July 2000, the Company paid Variagenics $7.5 million for a
    minority common stock equity ownership. The investment in
    Variagenics was included in other assets and carried at fair
    value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate
    component of other comprehensive income (loss). On
    January 31, 2003, Variagenics was merged with Hyseq
    Pharmaceuticals and is now named Nuvelo, Inc.
    (“Nuvelo”). In 2005, the Company sold its Nuvelo, Inc.
    common stock for $2.5 million resulting in a gain of
    $1.7 million which was recorded in other income in the
    consolidated statements of operations.


Acquisitions

Environmental
    Resources Associates:

In December 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Environmental Resources Associates, Inc.
    (“ERA”), a provider of environmental testing products
    for quality control, proficiency testing and specialty
    calibration chemicals used in environmental laboratories, for
    approximately $62.5 million, including $0.4 million of
    acquisition-related transaction costs and the assumption of
    $3.8 million of debt. This acquisition was accounted for
    under the purchase method of accounting and the results of
    operations of ERA have been included in the consolidated results
    of the Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of
    the acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets
    and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values.
    The Company has initially allocated $29.9 million of the
    purchase price to intangible assets comprised of customer
    relationships, non-compete agreements, acquired technology and
    other purchased intangibles. The Company is amortizing the
    customer relationships, acquired technology and other purchased
    intangibles over ten years. The non-compete agreements are being
    amortized over five years. These intangible assets are being
    amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately
    10 years. Included in intangible assets is a trademark in
    the amount of $3.7 million that has been assigned an
    indefinite life. The excess purchase price of $45.3 million
    after this allocation has been accounted for as goodwill. The
    goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The Company considered a number of factors to determine the
    purchase price allocation, including engaging a third party
    valuation firm to independently appraise the fair value of
    certain assets acquired. The Company is still in the process of
    making a final determination of the purchase price allocation
    based upon obtaining the third party

    (“VICAM”) for approximately $13.8 million,
    including $0.3 million of acquisition-related transaction
    costs. The Company anticipates continuous increases in
    laboratory testing to ensure food safety. This acquisition was
    accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the
    results of operations of VICAM have been included in the
    consolidated results of the Company from the acquisition date.
    The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to tangible
    and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their
    estimated fair values. The Company has allocated
    $7.7 million of the purchase price to intangible assets
    comprised of customer relationships, non-compete agreements,
    acquired technology and other purchased intangibles. The Company
    is amortizing acquired technology and other purchased
    intangibles over twelve years and customer relationships over
    fifteen years. The non-compete agreements are being amortized
    over five years. These intangible assets are being amortized
    over a weighted-average period of 13 years. Included in
    intangible assets is a trademark in the amount of
    $2.1 million that has been assigned an indefinite life. The
    excess purchase price of $3.7 million after this allocation
    has been accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is deductible
    for tax purposes.

The Company considered a number of factors to determine the

In August 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Thermometric AB (“Thermometrics”), a
    manufacturer of high performance microcalorimeters, and certain
    net assets and customer lists from an Asian distributor of
    thermal analysis products, for a total of $3.2 million in
    cash. As part of the Thermometrics acquisition, the Company
    assumed $1.2 million of debt. These acquisitions were
    accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the
    results of operations of these acquisitions have been included
    in the consolidated results of the Company from the acquisition
    dates. The combined purchase price of the acquisitions was
    allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed
    liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The Company
    has allocated $2.2 million of the combined purchase price
    to intangible assets comprised of customer relationships,
    non-compete agreements and acquired technology. The combined
    excess purchase price of $1.5 million after this allocation
    has been accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is not
    deductible for tax purposes.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
    acquired various tangible and intangible assets of certain Asian
    distributors totaling approximately $1.4 million.

NuGenesis:

In February 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of NuGenesis Technologies Corporation
    (“NuGenesis”), a company headquartered in Westborough,
    Massachusetts, for approximately $42.9 million in cash.
    NuGenesis developed and marketed the NuGenesis Scientific Data
    Management System (“SDMS”).

The acquisition of NuGenesis was accounted for under the
    purchase method of accounting and the results of operations of
    NuGenesis have been included in the consolidated results of the
    Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the
    acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and
    assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The
    Company has allocated $13.1 million of the purchase price
    to intangible assets comprised of customer lists, trademarks and
    other purchased intangibles. The excess purchase price of
    $16.1 million after this allocation has been accounted for
    as goodwill.

The following represents the unaudited pro forma results of the
    ongoing operations for Waters, ERA, VICAM, Thermometrics and
    NuGenesis as though the acquisitions of ERA, VICAM,
    Thermometrics and NuGenesis had occurred at the beginning of
    each period shown (in thousands, except per share data). The pro
    forma information, however, is not necessarily indicative of the
    results that would have resulted had the acquisition occurred at
    the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily
    indicative of future results.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

The carrying amount of goodwill was $265.2 million and
    $210.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to the
    Company’s acquisitions of VICAM, Thermometrics and ERA
    (Note 6) of approximately $3.7 million,
    $1.5 million and $45.3 million, respectively. Currency
    translation adjustments increased goodwill approximately
    $4.1 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
    acquired approximately $39.8 million of purchased
    intangibles as a result of the acquisitions of VICAM,
    Thermometrics, ERA and the distributor rights from an Asian
    distributor of thermal analysis products. In addition, the gross
    carrying value of intangible assets increased by approximately
    $2.9 million and decreased approximately $3.3 million
    in 2006 and 2005, respectively, due to the effect of foreign
    currency translation.

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    amortization expense for intangible assets was
    $20.3 million, $20.0 million and $19.9 million,
    respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is
    estimated to be approximately $23.3 million for each of the
    next five years. Accumulated amortization for intangible assets
    increased approximately $1.0 million and decreased
    approximately $0.9 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively,
    due to the effect of foreign currency translation.

During 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of
    $4.0 million in the consolidated statements of operations
    for the impairment of a license with Sandia National
    Laboratories.


Debt

In November 2005, the Company entered into a credit agreement
    (the “November 2005 Credit Agreement”) that provides
    for a $250.0 million term loan facility due in November
    2010. The Company used the proceeds of the term loan to finance
    the repurchase of common stock under its stock repurchase
    program previously approved by its Board of Directors and for
    general corporate purposes. The interest rates applicable to any
    U.S. borrowings under the November 2005 Credit Agreement
    are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate
    (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate
    plus 1/2%) or, on any Euro borrowings, the applicable 1,
    2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus
    an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage
    ratio, which can range between 37.5 basis points and 112.5
    basis points. The November 2005 Credit Agreement requires that
    the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not
    less than 3.50:1, and a leverage ratio test of not more than
    3.25:1, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters,
    respectively. In addition, the November 2005 Credit Agreement
    includes negative covenants that are customary for investment
    grade credit facilities and are similar in nature to ones
    contained in the Company’s existing credit facility. The
    November 2005 Credit Agreement also contains certain customary
    representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events
    of default, similar in nature to those in the Company’s
    existing credit facility.

In December 2004, the Company entered into a syndicated
    committed credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”)
    that provides for a $250.0 million term loan facility due
    in December 2009 and, subsequent to the amendment discussed
    below, a $550.0 million revolving facility, which includes
    both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility. In October
    2005, the Company exercised the $100.0 million expansion
    feature in the Credit Agreement dated December 2004, increasing
    the amount from $700.0 million to $800.0 million. In
    October 2005,



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Company amended the Credit Agreement (the “Amended
    Credit Agreement”) to increase the leverage ratio test from
    not more than 3.0:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal
    quarters, to 3.25:1 and to amend the definition of Consolidated
    EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
    amortization) to exclude stock-based compensation to the extent
    deducted from consolidated net income pursuant to
    SFAS 123(R). All other terms and conditions under the
    original Credit Agreement with respect to interest rates,
    interest coverage ratio test, maturity dates and affirmative and
    negative covenants remained substantially the same in the
    Amended Credit Agreement.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had
    $250.0 million borrowed under the November 2005 Credit
    Agreement and $635.0 million under the Amended Credit
    Agreement for a total of $885.0 million borrowed under the
    two credit agreements and an amount available to borrow of
    $163.4 million after outstanding letters of credit. In
    total, $500.0 million of the total debt was classified as
    long-term debt and $385.0 million classified as short-term
    debt at December 31, 2006 in the consolidated balance
    sheets. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had
    $250.0 million borrowed under the November 2005 Credit
    Agreement and $560.0 million under the Amended Credit
    Agreement for a total of $810.0 million borrowed under the
    two credit agreements and an amount available to borrow of
    $238.4 million after outstanding letters of credit. In
    total, $500.0 million of the total debt was classified as
    long-term debt and $310.0 million classified as short-term
    debt at December 31, 2005 in the consolidated balance
    sheets. The Company, and its foreign subsidiaries, also had
    available short-term lines of credit, totaling
    $96.8 million at December 31, 2006 and
    $76.9 million at December 31, 2005. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, related short-term borrowings
    were $18.5 million at a weighted-average interest rate of
    3.21% and $16.3 million at a weighted-average interest rate
    of 3.11%, respectively.

On January 11, 2007, Waters Corporation and Waters
    Technologies Ireland Ltd. entered into a new credit agreement
    (the “2007 Credit Agreement”). The 2007 Credit
    Agreement provides for a $500 million term loan facility, a
    $350 million revolving facility
    (“U.S. Tranche”), which includes both a letter of
    credit and a swingline subfacility, and a $250 million
    revolving facility (“European Tranche”) that is
    available to Waters Corporation in U.S. dollars and Waters
    Technologies Ireland Ltd. in either U.S. dollars or Euro.
    Waters Corporation may on one or more occasions request of the
    lender group that commitments for the U.S. Tranche or
    European Tranche be increased by an amount of not less than
    $25 million, up to an aggregate additional amount of
    $250 million. Existing lenders are not obligated to
    increase commitments and the Company can seek to bring in
    additional lenders. The term loan facility and the revolving
    facilities both mature on January 11, 2012 and require no
    scheduled prepayments before that date.

On January 11, 2007, the Company borrowed $500 million
    under the new term loan facility, $115 million under the
    new European Tranche, and $270 million under the new
    U.S. Tranche revolving facility. The Company used the
    proceeds of the term loan and the revolving borrowings to repay
    the outstanding amounts under the Company’s existing
    multi-borrower credit agreement dated as of December 15,
    2004 and amended as of October 12, 2005 and the
    Company’s existing term loan agreement dated as of
    November 28, 2005. Waters Corporation terminated such
    agreements early without penalty.

The interest rates applicable to term loan and revolving loans
    under the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s
    option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of
    the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the
    applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate,
    in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the
    Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between
    33 basis points and 72.5 basis points. The facility
    fee on the 2007 Credit Agreement ranges between 7 basis
    points and 15 basis points. The 2007 Credit Agreement
    requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio
    test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not
    more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal
    quarters, respectively, the same as the terminated credit
    agreements. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes
    negative covenants that are customary for investment grade
    credit facilities and are similar in nature to ones contained in
    the terminated credit agreements. The 2007 Credit Agreement also
    contains certain customary representations and warranties,
    affirmative covenants and events of default which are similar in
    nature to those in the terminated credit agreements.

    $40.4 million and $50.0 million are included in other
    assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company’s deferred tax assets associated with net
    operating loss, tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum
    tax credits are comprised of the following at December 31,
    2006: $33.7 million ($87.5 million pre-tax) benefit of
    U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards
    that begin to expire in 2020 and 2007, respectively;
    $64.1 million in foreign tax credits, which begin to expire
    in 2009; $7.0 million in research and development credits
    that begin to expire in 2010; and $10.5 million
    ($39.6 million pre-tax) in foreign net operating losses,
    $9.0 million ($31.8 million pre-tax) of which do not
    expire under current law, the remainder of which begin to expire
    in 2008.

The Company has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of
    $86.8 million, principally against foreign tax credits
    ($64.1 million), certain foreign net operating losses and
    other deferred tax assets. The benefit relating to foreign tax
    credits and these other deferred tax assets, if realized, will
    be credited to additional paid-in capital.

The income tax benefits associated with non-qualified stock
    option compensation expense recognized for tax purposes and
    credited to additional paid-in capital were $16.5 million,
    $4.9 million and $32.0 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

At December 31, 2006, there were unremitted earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries of approximately $556.5 million. The
    Company has not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign
    withholding taxes on these earnings as it is the Company’s
    current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside
    the U.S.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”,
    requires that a Company continually evaluate the necessity of
    establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax
    assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that
    actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future
    periods.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had determined that it
    was more likely than not that the actual tax benefit of
    $167.5 million of its deferred tax assets would not be
    realized. The Company had therefore recorded a cumulative
    $167.5 million valuation allowance to reduce the net
    carrying value of these assets to zero for financial reporting
    purposes as of December 31, 2004. The valuation allowance
    was determined based on the Company’s review of its future
    estimated U.S. taxable income levels and the estimated
    future stock option exercises. Included in this
    $167.5 million valuation allowance was $154.9 million
    related to the future tax benefit of U.S. net operating
    losses generated by the exercise of non-qualified stock options.
    As required by SFAS No. 109 and APB Opinion
    No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees”, the Company had originally recorded all
    $154.9 million of these future tax benefits as increased
    additional paid-in capital. Accordingly, when the Company
    recorded a valuation allowance against these future tax
    benefits, the Company also reduced additional paid-in capital by
    $154.9 million.

As required by SFAS No. 109, the Company maintained
    this deferred tax asset valuation allowance until it determined,
    during 2005, that it was more likely than not that it would
    realize the actual tax benefit of $92.5 million of deferred
    tax assets for which a full valuation allowance had been
    previously provided. The Company made this determination based
    on the level of the Company’s actual 2005 U.S. taxable
    income, the Company’s projected future U.S. taxable
    income levels, the Company’s actual 2005 tax deduction from
    the exercise of non-qualified stock options and the fact that
    the Company’s future tax deduction from the exercise of
    non-qualified stock options would most likely be less than in
    the past as those options, which were significantly

in-the-money,

were expiring and exercised by December 31, 2005. The
    Company therefore recorded, in 2005, a $92.5 million
    reduction in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Because
    this reduction in the valuation allowance included
    $78.8 million related to the future tax benefit of
    U.S. net operating losses generated by the exercise of
    non-qualified stock options, the Company also restored
    $78.8 million to the Company’s additional paid-in
    capital in 2005, in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and
    APB No. 25. The remaining balance was credited to goodwill
    in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company believes an
    appropriate level of profitability had been established and
    believes that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets
    will be realized in the future. The Company made this
    determination based on a review of facts and circumstances at
    that time.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act
    (“AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA creates a
    temporary incentive for U.S. multi-national corporations to
    repatriate income accumulated abroad by providing an 85%
    dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
    controlled foreign corporations. It previously had been the
    Company’s practice to permanently reinvest all foreign
    earnings into foreign operations. In July 2005, the Board of
    Directors of the Company approved the repatriation of
    $500.0 million as a qualified distribution in accordance
    with the AJCA. The Company has used and will continue to use the
    repatriated cash to fund current and future operating expenses
    within the parameters of Internal Revenue Service guidance.
    During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a tax
    liability of $24.0 million for the federal, state and
    foreign taxes related to the qualified and base period
    distribution in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The
    Company paid $10.0 million of this tax during 2005 and
    approximately $9.0 million during the first quarter of
    2006. The remainder of this tax liability was offset by the tax
    benefit of carryforwards.

The Company’s effective tax rates for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 15.5%, 26.4% and
    21.6%, respectively. Included in the 2005 effective tax rate is
    the $24.0 million of income tax expense related to the
    repatriation of funds from the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries under the AJCA. The remaining decrease in the
    effective tax rates for 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily
    attributable to the proportionate increase in income in
    international jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates,
    primarily Ireland and Singapore. In addition, the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in the recognition of a tax
    benefit at a higher effective tax rate in 2006. The 2004
    effective tax rate was impacted by the net tax effect of the
    Perkin-Elmer litigation judgment received and the litigation
    provisions for the on-going patent infringement suit with
    Hewlett-Packard.

Applera
    Corporation:

On March 2, 2004, the Company and MDS, Inc., through its
    Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments partnership, and
    Applied Biosystems entered into a settlement agreement (the
    “Applera Settlement Agreement”) with respect to the
    various civil actions pending against each of them, both in the
    United States and internationally. Stipulations of Dismissal or
    their foreign equivalents (the “Stipulations”) with
    respect to the disposal of all such actions have been entered in
    the applicable courts and tribunals in each of the United
    States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.

The Applera Settlement Agreement provides for the resolution of
    all patent infringement claims in the United States made by
    certain of the parties against the other and of international
    cases brought by MDS, Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex
    Instruments against the Company with respect to alleged
    infringements of those parties’ patents at issue in the
    United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.

In consideration of entering into the Applera Settlement
    Agreement and the Stipulations, the Company and MDS, Inc. and
    Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments entered into royalty
    paying license agreements, cross licensing the use of the
    technology described in the parties’ respective patents at
    issue. In addition, the Company made a one-time payment to
    Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments of $18.1 million
    on March 11, 2004.

Hewlett-Packard
    Company:

The Company filed suit in the United States against
    Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH (collectively,
    “HP”), seeking a declaration that certain products
    sold under the mark “Alliance” did not constitute an
    infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or its foreign
    subsidiaries (the “HP patents”). The action in the
    United States was dismissed for lack of controversy. Actions
    seeking revocation or nullification of foreign HP patents were
    filed by the Company in Germany, France and England. A German
    patent tribunal found the HP German patent to be valid. In
    Germany, France and England, HP and its successor, Agilent
    Technologies Deutschland GmbH (“Agilent”), brought
    actions alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump may
    infringe the HP patents. In England, the Court of Appeal found
    the HP patent valid and infringed. The Company’s petitions
    for leave to appeal to the House of Lords were denied. A trial
    on damages was scheduled for November 2004.

In March 2004, Agilent brought a new action against the Company
    alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump continued to
    infringe the HP patents. At a hearing held in the UK in June
    2004, the UK court postponed the previously scheduled November
    2004 damages trial until March 2005. Instead, the court
    scheduled the trial in the new action for November 2004. In
    December 2004, following a trial in the new action, the UK court
    ruled that the Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent
    filed an appeal in that action, which was heard in July 2005,
    and the UK Appellate Court upheld the lower court’s ruling
    of non-infringement. The damages trial scheduled for March 2005
    was postponed pending this appeal and rescheduled for December
    2005. In December 2005, a trial on damages commenced in the
    first action and continued for six days prior to a holiday
    recess. In February 2006, the Company, HP and Agilent entered
    into a settlement agreement (the “Agilent Settlement
    Agreement”) with respect to the first action and a consent
    order dismissing the case was entered. The Agilent Settlement
    Agreement provides for the release of the Company and its UK
    affiliate from each and every claim under Agilent’s
    European patent (UK) number 309,596 arising out of the
    prior sale by either of them of Alliance Separations Modules
    incorporating the patented technology. In consideration of
    entering into the Agilent Settlement Agreement and the consent
    order, the Company made a payment to Agilent of 3.5 million
    British Pounds, in full and final settlement of Agilent’s
    claim for damages and in relation to all claims for costs and
    interest in the case.

In France, the Paris District Court has found the HP patent
    valid and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company appealed
    the French decision and, in April 2004, the French appeals court
    affirmed the Paris District Court’s finding of
    infringement. The Company has filed a further appeal in the
    case. The Company has sought a declaration from the French court
    that, as was found in both the UK and Germany, certain modified
    features of the Alliance pump do not infringe the HP patents. A
    hearing on this matter is currently scheduled for June 2007. In
    the

German case, a German court has found the patent infringed. The
    Company appealed the German decision and, in December 2004, the
    German appeals court reversed the trial court and issued a
    finding of non-infringement in favor of the Company. Agilent is
    seeking an appeal in that action and, in July 2005, brought a
    new action against the Company alleging that certain features of
    the Alliance pump continue to infringe the HP patents. In August
    2006, following a trial in this new action the German court
    ruled that the Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent
    has filed an appeal in this action.

The Company recorded a provision of $3.1 million during
    2005 for damages and fees to be incurred with respect to the
    litigation, which was settled in February 2006. The Company
    recorded a provision of $7.8 million in the first quarter
    of 2004 for estimated damages and fees to be incurred with
    respect to the ongoing litigation for the England and France
    suits. No provision has been made for the Germany suit and the
    Company believes the outcome, if the plaintiff ultimately
    prevails, will not have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial position. The accrued patent litigation expense in
    other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, was
    $0.9 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for the
    England and France suits. The change in the liability through
    December 31, 2005 is attributable to payment of remaining
    settlement costs in the U.K. case and payments of legal fees
    directly associated with the cases.

Perkin-Elmer
    Corporation:

The Company, through its subsidiary TA, asserted a claim against
    The Perkin-Elmer Corporation (“PE”) alleging patent
    infringement of three patents owned by TA (the “TAI
    patents”). PE counterclaimed for infringement of a patent
    owned by PE (the “PE patent”). The U.S. District
    Court for the District of Delaware granted judgment as a matter
    of law in favor of TA and enjoined PE from infringing the TAI
    patents. PE appealed the District Court judgment in favor of TA
    to the federal appellate court. The District Court’s
    judgment, with respect to PE’s infringement of the TAI
    patents, was affirmed. The District Court’s judgment, with
    respect to TA’s non-infringement of the PE patent, was
    reversed and remanded to the District Court for further
    proceedings.

On remand to the District Court in October 2002, a jury found PE
    liable to TA for damages of $13.3 million and found TA did
    not infringe the PE patent. In May 2003, the District Court
    entered judgment on the jury’s verdict in favor of the
    Company. PE has appealed the judgment with respect to TA’s
    non-infringement of the PE patent. A hearing on the matter was
    held on May 4, 2004. On May 5, 2004, the United States
    Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment
    of non-infringement of the PE Patent. On May 11, 2004, PE,
    now known as Applera Corporation, paid the Company
    $17.4 million, including $0.2 million in post-judgment
    interest. Approximately $0.1 million in legal fees were
    incurred and were offset against the recording of settlement
    proceeds.


Restructuring
    and Other Charges

    Restructuring:

In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan,
    primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe, that
    resulted in the employment of 74 employees being terminated, all
    of which had left the Company as of December 31, 2006. In
    addition, the Company closed a sales and demonstration office in
    the Netherlands in the second quarter of 2006. The Company
    implemented this cost reduction plan primarily to realign its
    operating costs with business opportunities around the world.

The following is a summary of activity of the Company’s
    2006 restructuring liability included in other current
    liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands):

The Company does not expect to incur any additional charges in
    connection with this restructuring. Other charges include
    approximately $0.7 million of leasehold improvement assets,
    net of accumulated amortization, written-off as a result of the
    closure of the facility in the Netherlands.

    Restructuring:

In January 2004, the Company initiated a small restructuring
    effort to realign its personnel between various support
    functions and field sales and service organizations around the
    world. As a result, 70 employees were terminated, all of which
    had left the Company as of December 31, 2004. The provision
    of $2.1 million, recorded during the year ended
    December 31, 2004, represents costs incurred, including
    severance costs, for the 70 people and other directly
    related incremental costs of this realignment effort. The
    Company’s 2004 restructuring liability was zero at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005. Also during 2004, the Company
    reversed approximately $2.2 million in restructuring
    accruals related to a 2002 restructuring initiative.


Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Lease agreements, expiring at various dates through 2022, cover
    buildings, office equipment and automobiles. Rental expense was
    $23.3 million, $23.2 million and $19.7 million
    during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Future minimum rents payable as of
    December 31, 2006 under non-cancelable leases with initial
    terms exceeding one year are as follows (in thousands):

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third
    parties, which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid
    for licenses were approximately $0.6 million,
    $0.8 million and $1.1 million during the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future
    minimum licenses payable under existing license agreements as of
    December 31, 2006 will be immaterial for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and thereafter.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
    in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
    business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
    its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
    individually or in the aggregate, with the exception of the
    current litigation described in Note 10, will not be
    material to the financial position or results of operations.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in
    its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements,
    the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse
    the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
    indemnified party, generally the Company’s business
    partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or
    other intellectual property infringement claims by any third
    party with respect to its current products, as well as claims
    relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from
    the performance of services by the Company or its
    subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments
    the Company could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the
    Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
    relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and
    management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of
    these agreements is immaterial.

13  Stock-Based
    Compensation

On May 6, 2003, the Company’s shareholders approved
    the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (“2003
    Plan”). As of December 31, 2006, the 2003 Plan has
    5.4 million shares available for granting in the form of
    incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
    rights (“SARs”), restricted stock or other types of
    awards (e.g. restricted stock units). The Company issues new
    shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or
    restricted stock



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

unit conversion. Under the 2003 Plan, the exercise price for
    stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the
    underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2003 Plan is
    scheduled to terminate on March 4, 2013. Options generally
    will expire no later than 10 years after the date on which
    they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally
    vest ratably over a five year period. A SAR may be granted alone
    or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of
    restricted stock and restricted stock units may be issued under
    the 2003 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. No award of
    restricted stock may have a restriction period of less than
    three years except as may be recommended by the Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors, or with respect to any
    award of restricted stock which provides solely for a
    performance-based risk of forfeiture so long as such award has a
    restriction period of at least one year. As of December 31,
    2006, the Company had stock options, restricted stock and
    restricted stock unit awards outstanding.

On February 26, 1996, the Company adopted its 1996 Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible employees may
    contribute up to 15% of their earnings toward the quarterly
    purchase of the Company’s common stock. The plan makes
    available 1.0 million shares of the Company’s common
    stock commencing October 1, 1996. As of December 31,
    2006, 0.7 million shares have been issued under the plan.
    Each plan period lasts three months beginning on January 1,
    April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. The
    purchase price for each share of stock is the lesser of 90% of
    the market price on the first day of the plan period or 100% of
    the market price on the last day of the plan period. Stock-based
    compensation expense related to this plan was $0.4 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006.

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R), which amends SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, and
    SAB 107, “Share-Based Payment”. These standards
    require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized
    in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The
    Company has used the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair
    value of its stock option awards at the time of grant.

The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method
    permitted under SFAS No. 123(R) and consequently has
    not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified
    prospective transition method, compensation costs associated
    with awards for the year ended December 31, 2006 now
    include the expense relating to the remaining unvested awards
    granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense related
    to any awards issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The
    Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line
    attribution method. The amount of stock-based compensation
    recognized during the period is based on the value of the
    portion of the award that ultimately is expected to vest.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The
    cumulative effect of the change in accounting for forfeitures is
    immaterial.

The consolidated statements of operations for the three years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 include the
    following stock-based compensation expense related to stock
    option awards, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit
    awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands):

The after-tax stock-based compensation and the impact to diluted

SFAS No. 123(R)

for the year ended December 31, 2006 were
    $20.6 million with a $0.20 per share reduction to
    diluted earnings per share. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company has capitalized stock-based compensation costs of
    $0.6 million and $1.0 million to inventory and
    capitalized software, respectively, in the consolidated balance
    sheets. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the
    Company used the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed
    by APB No. 25 and related interpretations, including
    Financial Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 44,
    “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
    Compensation”, for its plans. Under this accounting method,

stock-option compensation awards that are granted with the
    exercise price at the current fair value of the Company’s
    common stock as of the date of the award generally did not
    require compensation expense to be recognized in the
    consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based compensation
    expense recognized for the Company’s fixed employee stock
    option plans, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan
    was $0.8 million and $0.1 million in the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 and 2004
    stock-based compensation expense amounts were all recorded in
    selling and administrative expenses.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), benefits of
    tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were
    reported as part of cash from operating activities. Under
    SFAS No. 123(R), approximately $16.5 million of
    windfall benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
    compensation costs were reported as cash from financing
    activities for the year ended December 31, 2006.

During 2006 the total intrinsic value of the stock options
    exercised (i.e., the difference between the market price at
    exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the
    options) was $40.1 million and the total cash received from
    the exercise of these stock options was $39.9 million.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $61.1 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock
    option awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 3.1 years.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
    earnings per share had the Company applied the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 for the
    Company’s stock-based compensation plans for all of the
    periods shown.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Beginning in
    2005, the Company used implied volatility on its publicly traded
    options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility.
    The expected volatility assumption of all grants issued prior to
    2005 was derived from the Company’s historical volatility.
    The expected life assumption for 2006 grants is based on
    historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock
    optionees. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently
    available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a
    remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input
    to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine
    the value of the 2006 stock option grants is as follows:

Options exercisable at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
    were 6.3 million, 6.7 million and 6.1 million,
    respectively. The weighted-average exercise prices of options
    exercisable at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
    $37.43, $34.34 and $31.98, respectively. The weighted-average
    remaining contractual life of the exercisable outstanding stock
    options at December 31, 2006 was 4.9 years. The
    aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding stock options at
    December 31, 2006 was $125.6 million.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had 9.3 million
    stock options which are vested and expected to vest. The
    intrinsic value, the weighted-average price and the remaining
    contractual life of the vested and expected to vest stock
    options were $124.0 million, $38.40 and 5.9 years,
    respectively, at December 31, 2006.

In 2005, the Company approved an amendment to accelerate the
    vesting of approximately 12 thousand unvested stock options and
    to extend the expiration date of approximately 36 thousand stock
    options granted to a retiring non-employee director of the
    Company. The Company also approved an amendment to accelerate
    the vesting of 2 thousand shares of the Company’s
    restricted common stock granted to the same director. Under
    APB 25 and FIN 44 these modifications resulted in a
    charge which was recorded in selling and administrative expense
    in the 2005 consolidated statements of operations of
    approximately $0.5 million.

On December 31, 2004, the Company approved an amendment to
    accelerate the vesting of approximately 238 thousand unvested
    stock options granted between December 2000 and February 2001 to
    certain employees of the Company. These options had an exercise
    price significantly greater than the market value of the
    Company’s stock at that time; hence, in accordance with APB
    No. 25 and FIN 44, no compensation expense was
    recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Each
    stock option was scheduled to vest primarily in 2005, but became
    fully vested and exercisable on December 31, 2004. The
    exercise price and number of shares underlying each affected



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

stock option were unchanged. The acceleration of these options
    was primarily done as a result of the issuance of
    SFAS No. 123(R), which under the modified prospective
    method, requires the expensing of unvested stock options in the
    first annual reporting period that begins after June 15,
    2005. As a result of this acceleration, the Company recognized
    share-based compensation, net of related tax effects, of
    $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 in the pro forma
    net income disclosure for SFAS No. 123.

Restricted
    Stock:

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
    granted eight thousand shares of restricted stock. During each
    of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company
    granted seven thousand shares of restricted stock. The
    restrictions on these shares lapse January 30, 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. The Company has recorded
    $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million of
    compensation expense during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
    related to the restricted stock grants. The weighted-average
    fair value on the grant date of the restricted stock for 2006,
    2005 and 2004 was $39.64, $45.77 and $33.12, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company has twenty thousand unvested
    shares of restricted stock outstanding with a total of
    $0.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost. This cost
    is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.1 years. As of January 1, 2006, the Company had
    twelve thousand unvested shares of restricted stock outstanding.

Restricted
    Stock Units:

During 2006, the Company granted three hundred and eighteen
    thousand restricted stock units which vest ratably over a five
    year period. The weighted-average fair value of these awards was
    based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant which
    was $43.02 per unit. The amount of compensation cost
    recognized for the year ended December 31, 2006 on the
    restricted stock units expected to vest was $1.9 million.
    As of December 31, 2006, none of these shares were vested
    and there was $10.2 million of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to the restricted stock unit awards
    that are expected to vest. This cost is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.

Retirement
    Plans

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan, a defined contribution plan, after one
    month of service. Employees may contribute from 1% to 30% of
    eligible pay on a pre-tax basis. After one year of service, the
    Company makes a matching contribution of 50% for contributions
    up to 6% of eligible pay. Employees are 100% vested in employee
    and Company matching contributions. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company’s
    matching contributions amounted to $3.6 million,
    $3.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively.

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters
    Retirement Plan, a defined benefit, cash balance plan, after one
    year of service. Annually, the Company credits each
    employee’s account as a percentage of eligible pay based on
    years of service. In addition, each employee’s account is
    credited for investment returns at the beginning of each year
    for the prior year at the average 12 month Treasury
    Bill rate plus 0.5%, limited to a minimum rate of 5% and a
    maximum rate of 10%. An employee does not vest until the
    completion of five years of service, at which time the employee
    becomes 100% vested.

The Company maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive
    Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which is non-qualified and
    restores the benefits under the Waters Retirement Plan that are
    limited by IRS benefit and compensation maximums. The Company
    also sponsors other unfunded employee benefit plans in the U.S.,
    including a retirement health care plan, which provides
    reimbursement for medical expenses and is contributory. There
    are various

non-U.S. retirement

plans sponsored by the Company. The eligibility and vesting of
    the

non-U.S. plans

are generally consistent with the local laws and regulations.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 158 which amends SFAS No. 87,
    SFAS No. 88, SFAS No. 106 and
    SFAS No. 132(R). This standard requires an employer to
    recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans,
    previously disclosed in the footnotes to the financial
    statements, as an asset or liability in its statement of
    financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
    status in the year in which the changes occur through
    comprehensive income. The effect of adopting
    SFAS No. 158 on the statements of financial position

The net periodic pension cost under SFAS 87 is made up of
    several components that reflect different aspects of the
    Company’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of
    benefits earned by employees. These components are determined
    using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method and are
    based on certain actuarial assumptions. The Company’s
    accounting policy is to reflect in the projected benefit
    obligation all benefit changes to which the Company is committed
    as of the current valuation date; use a market-related value of
    assets to determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior
    service costs on a straight-line basis over the expected future
    service of active participants as of the date such costs are
    first recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and
    losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related
    value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation over
    the expected future service of active participants.

The asset allocation policy for the U.S. pension and

    long-term investment objectives: achieving a return on assets
    consistent with the investment policy,



NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

maximizing portfolio returns with at least a return of 2.5%
    above the one-year Treasury Bill rate, and achieving portfolio
    returns which exceeds the average return for similarly invested
    funds.

Within the equity portfolio of the U.S. retirement plan,
    investments are diversified among capitalization and style. Up
    to 20% of the U.S. retirement plan’s equity portfolio
    may be invested in financial markets outside of the United
    States. The Company does not invest in its own stock within the
    U.S. retirement plan assets.

The Company prohibits the following types of assets or
    transactions in the U.S. retirement plan: short selling,
    margin transactions, commodities and future contracts, private
    placements, options and letter stock.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
    assumption, the Company considered the historical returns and
    the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as
    well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio and
    historical expenses paid by the plan. A one-quarter percentage
    point increase in the discount rate would decrease the
    Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the
    U.S. pension plan by approximately $0.4 million. A
    one-quarter percentage point change in the assumed long-term
    rate of return would impact the Company’s net periodic
    benefit cost for the U.S. pension plan by approximately
    $0.2 million.

During fiscal year 2007, the Company expects to contribute
    approximately $4.0 million to $8.0 million to the
    Company’s pension plans.

Estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2006

Business
    Segment Information

SFAS 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
    and Related Information,” establishes standards for
    reporting information about operating segments in annual
    financial statements and requires selected information for those
    segments to be presented in interim financial reports of public
    business enterprises. It also establishes standards for related
    disclosures about products and service, geographic areas and
    major customers. The



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company’s business activities, for which discrete financial
    information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated
    by the chief operating decision-makers. As a result of this
    evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating
    segments: Waters Division and TA Division.

Waters Division is in the business of designing, manufacturing,
    distributing and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and
    other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used
    along with other analytical instruments. TA Division is in the
    business of designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing
    thermal analysis and rheometry instruments. The Company’s
    two divisions are its operating segments and each has similar
    economic characteristics, product processes, products and
    services, types and classes of customers, methods of
    distribution, and regulatory environments. Because of these
    similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one
    reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer
    to the consolidated financial statements for financial
    information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company.

Net sales for the Company’s products and services are as
    follows for the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005

The Company experiences a seasonal increase in sales in the
    fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits on capital
    goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets
    by calendar year-end. Selling and administrative expenses are
    typically higher in the second quarter over the first quarter in
    each year as the Company’s annual payroll merit increases
    take effect. Expenses traditionally are lower in the third
    quarter due to lower travel and promotional expenses as this is
    a typical vacation period. Selling and administrative expenses
    will vary in the fourth quarter in relation to performance in
    the quarter and for the year. In the third quarter of 2005, the
    Company recorded a tax liability of $24.0 million related
    to the repatriation of funds from the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

As a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), “Share Based
    Payment”, as of January 1, 2006, all share-based
    payments to employees have been recognized in the statements of
    operations based on their fair values. The Company adopted the
    modified prospective transition method permitted under
    SFAS No. 123(R) and, consequently, has not adjusted results
    from prior years. Stock-based compensation expense related to
    SFAS 123(R) was approximately $28.8 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.

**

As result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of
    December 31, 2006, the Company was required to recognize
    the underfunded status of the Company’s retirement plans as
    a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Prior to 2006, a
    significant portion of the Company’s retirement
    contribution accrual was classified in other current liabilities
    and included in working capital. In 2006, in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158, the majority of the retirement
    contribution accrual is included in the long-term retirement
    liabiliy. Also, as result of the adoption
    SFAS No. 158, stockholders’ equity decreased by
    $1.7 million after-tax.

In the second quarter of 2002, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for legal costs associated with litigating patents
    effective January 1, 2002. As a result, the Company
    recorded a cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles
    of $4.5 million, net of tax.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, with the participation of the

    officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
    this annual report on

Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
    (1) designed to ensure that material information relating
    to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
    known to the Company’s chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
    during the period in which this report was being prepared and
    (2) effective, in that they provide reasonable assurance
    that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

    reporting (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2006 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.
