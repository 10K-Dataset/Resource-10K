WATERS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

INDEX

PART I

Item 1:

Business

General

Waters Corporation (“Waters

®

” or the “Company”) is an analytical instrument manufacturer that primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters Division, high
performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC

®

”
and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These
systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using a common software platform and are used along with other analytical instruments. Through its TA Division
(“TA

®

”), the Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry
and calorimetry instruments. The Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments as well as other manufacturers’ instruments.

The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, life science, biochemical, industrial, food, environmental, academic and
government customers working in research and development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications. The Company’s LC and LC-MS instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the
chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, as well as to purify a full range of compounds. These instruments are used in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes
(known as “proteomics”), food safety analysis and environmental testing. The Company’s thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids for
uses in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research.

Waters, organized as a Delaware corporation in 1991, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common
stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating subsidiary. Waters became a publicly-traded company with its initial public offering (“IPO”) in November 1995. Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and complementary
technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited
(“Micromass

®

”) in September 1997.

Business Segments

The Company’s business activities, for which financial information
is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision makers. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters Division and TA Division. The Company operates in the
analytical instruments industry by designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing instrument systems, columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The Company’s two
operating segments, Waters Division and TA Division, have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities,
the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes.

Information concerning
revenues and long-lived assets attributable to each of the Company’s products, services and geographic areas is set forth in Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Waters Division

High
Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography

HPLC is the standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent
components of a variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes that HPLC’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and


identify approximately 80% of all known chemicals and materials. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes, quality
control and process engineering applications.

The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served by the
pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these markets, HPLC is used extensively to identify new drugs, develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other
applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations, the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry, as well as applications in other industries, such
as chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by universities, research institutions and government agencies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”) and their international counterparts that mandate testing requiring HPLC instrumentation.

Traditionally, a typical HPLC system has consisted of five basic components: solvent delivery system, sample injector, separation column,
detector and data acquisition unit. The solvent delivery system pumps solvents through the HPLC system, while the sample injector introduces samples into the solvent flow. The chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for
analysis by the detector, which measures the presence and amount of the constituents. The data acquisition unit, usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system, then records and stores the information from the detector.

In 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company describes as ultra performance liquid
chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY UPLC

®

, to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles. By using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and
analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by HPLC. In addition, in using ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications
beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to uncover new levels of scientific information. While offering significant performance advantages, ACQUITY UPLC is also compatible with the Company’s software products and the general operating protocols of
HPLC. For these reasons, the Company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument. In 2010, Waters introduced the ACQUITY UPLC

®

H-Class instrument system, which incorporates the performance of ACQUITY UPLC with the operational familiarity of
traditional HPLC systems. The ACQUITY UPLC H-Class is a streamlined system that brings together the flexibility and simplicity of quaternary solvent blending and a flow-through needle injector to deliver the advanced performance expected of
UPLC-type separations. The ACQUITY UPLC H-Class delivers high resolution, sensitivity and improved through-put while maintaining the robustness and reliability for which the ACQUITY systems are known. In 2011, the Company introduced the ACQUITY UPLC

®

I-Class instrument system. The ACQUITY UPLC I-Class provides a powerful solution to the most critical need by
successfully analyzing compounds that are limited in amount or availability amid a complex matrix. The ACQUITY UPLC I-Class system maximizes peak capacity to enhance MS sensitivity; it provides the lowest carryover, complementing MS sensitivity and
extending MS linear dynamic range; and it has been purposefully engineered for the lowest dispersion. During 2011 and 2010, the Company experienced sales growth in the LC instrument system product line primarily from the sales of ACQUITY UPLC,
ACQUITY UPLC H-Class and ACQUITY UPLC I-Class systems.

Waters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in configurations
that allow for varying degrees of automation, from component configured systems for academic research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing, and that have a variety of detection technologies, from ultra-violet
(“UV”) absorbance to MS, optimized for certain analyses. The Company also manufactures tailored LC systems for the analysis of biologics, as well as an LC detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of LC
to compounds that are not amenable to UV absorbance detection.


The primary consumable products for LC are chromatography columns. These columns are packed
with separation media used in the LC testing process and are replaced at regular intervals. The chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from silica. As the sample flows
through the column, it is separated into its constituent components.

Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and
competitors’ LC systems. The Company believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica, packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a
key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and can react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company believes that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used nearly exclusively on its ACQUITY UPLC instrument systems and,
furthermore, that its ACQUITY UPLC instrument primarily uses ACQUITY UPLC columns. In 2011 and 2010, the Company experienced sales growth in its LC chromatography column and sample preparation businesses, especially in ACQUITY UPLC columns.

The Company’s chemistry consumable products also include environmental and food safety testing products. Environmental
laboratories use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical
pharmaceutical analysis. In addition, the Company provides tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins in various agricultural commodities. These test kits provide reliable, quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of
flurometer, LC-MS or HPLC.

In February 2009, the Company acquired Thar Instruments, Inc. (“Thar”), a global leader
in the design, development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction (“SFC”) systems.

Mass Spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry

MS is a powerful
analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions.

The Company believes it is a market leader in the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of MS instruments. These
instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems, such as LC, chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography. A wide variety of instrumental
designs fall within the overall category of MS instrumentation, including devices that incorporate quadrupole, ion trap, time-of-flight (“Tof”) and classical magnetic sector technologies. Furthermore, these technologies are often used in
tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments.

Currently, the Company offers a wide range of MS instrument systems
utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof, ion mobility and magnetic sector designs. These instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development, as well as for environmental and food safety testing. The majority of mass
spectrometers sold by the Company are designed to utilize an LC system as the sample introduction device. These products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science, pharmaceutical, biomedical, clinical, food and environmental
market segments worldwide.

MS is an increasingly important detection technology for LC. The
Company’s smaller-sized mass spectrometers, such as the single quadrupole detector (“SQD”) and the tandem quadrupole detector (“TQD”), are often referred to as LC “detectors” and are typically sold as part of an LC
system or as an LC system upgrade. Larger quadrupole systems, such as the Xevo

®

TQ and Xevo

®

TQ-S instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for late-stage drug development, including clinical
trial testing. Quadrupole time-of-flight
(“Q-Tof

TM

”) instruments, such as the
Company’s SYNAPT

®

G2-S, are often used to analyze the role of proteins


in disease processes, an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics”. In late 2008, the Xevo

®

Q-Tof

TM

MS, an exact mass MS/MS bench-top instrument, was introduced. In late 2009, the Company introduced the SYNAPT

®

G2 HDMS

TM

system. The SYNAPT G2 HDMS and SYNAPT

®

G2 MS systems are high
resolution exact mass MS/MS platforms that are performance-enhanced replacements for the SYNAPT HDMS and SYNAPT MS systems. The performance enhancements offered by these new systems allow for higher resolution shape discrimination by the HDMS
version and superior mass resolution, mass accuracy and quantification accuracy by both versions. In 2010, the Company introduced the Xevo

®

TQ-S instrument system, which is designed for the most demanding UPLC/MS/MS applications. Also in 2010, the Company introduced the Xevo

®

G2 Q-Tof

TM

instrument system. The Xevo G2 Q-Tof is one of the most sensitive, exact mass quantitative and qualitative bench-top
MS/MS instrument systems developed because it combines the integrated workflow benefits of Engineered
Simplicity

TM

found in existing Xevo Q-Tof instrument
systems with the ground breaking QuanTof

TM

technology of
the SYNAPT G2 instrument system. In 2011, the Company introduced the SYNAPT

®

G2-S HDMS instrument system. The
SYNAPT G2-S incorporates both high-sensitivity Waters StepWave

TM

ion transfer optics and Triwave

®

ion mobility technologies along
with a suite of new informatics tools to take qualitative and quantitative high resolution performance to a new level.

LC and
MS are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device. An increasing percentage of the Company’s customers are purchasing LC and MS components
simultaneously and it is becoming common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user. The descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and
the historical categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly in today’s instrument market, this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and
MS technologies as part of a single device. In response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters Division to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated
LC-MS systems.

Based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly-disclosed sales figures from
competitors, the Company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of LC and LC-MS instrument systems, chromatography columns and other consumables and related services. The Company also believes that it has
the leading LC and LC-MS market share in the United States, Europe and Asia, and believes it may have a market share position in Japan that ranks second to a domestic supplier.

Waters Division Service

Services provided by Waters enable customers to maximize
technology productivity, support customer compliance activities and provide transparency into enterprise resource management efficiencies. The customer benefits from improved budget control, data-driven technology adoption and accelerated workflow
at a site or on a global perspective. The Company considers its service offerings to be highly differentiated from our competition, as evidenced by the consistent increase in service revenues each year. Our principal competitors in the service
market include PerkinElmer, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and General Electric Company. These competitors can provide services on Waters instruments to varying degrees and always present competitive risk.

The servicing and support of instruments, software and accessories is an important source of revenue and represents over 25%
of sales for the Waters Division. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans, demand service, customer training and performance validation services. Support plans most typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance
and an agreement to promptly repair a non-functioning instrument in return for a fee described in a contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument.


TA Division

Thermal Analysis, Rheometry and Calorimetry

Thermal analysis measures the physical
characteristics of materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials, such as their physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical properties, which may be measured by one or
more thermal analysis techniques, including calorimetry. Consequently, thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development, production and characterization of materials in various industries, such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles,
pharmaceuticals and electronics.

Rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in characterizing materials. Rheometry
characterizes the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity and deformation under different types of “loading” or conditions. The information obtained under such conditions provides insight into a
material’s behavior during processing, packaging, transport, usage and storage.

Thermal analysis and
rheometry instruments are heavily used in material testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide information useful in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
healthcare products, as well as for life science research. As with systems offered through the Waters Division, a range of instrumental configurations is available with increasing levels of sample handling and information processing automation. In
addition, systems and accompanying software packages can be tailored for specific applications. For example, the
Q-Series

TM

family of differential scanning calorimeters
includes a range of instruments, from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive systems that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a variety of sample cells and temperature control features for analyzing a broad range of materials. In 2009,
TA introduced the ARES G2 rheometer, a high performance system uniquely capable of independently measuring stress and strain for a wide variety of solids and liquids. In 2010, TA introduced the Nano ITC Low Volume system, which is engineered to
provide isothermal titration calorimetry capabilities for applications with limited sample sizes. Also in 2010, TA introduced the DMA-RH Accessory, which is designed to be used with the Q800 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer to allow the mechanical
properties of a sample to be analyzed under controlled and/or varying conditions of both relative humidity and temperature. In 2011, TA introduced the Discovery DSC, Discovery TGA and Discovery Hybrid Rheometer, which provide unmatched measurement
performance in the fields of differential scanning calorimetry and rheometery.

In July 2011, the Company acquired Anter
Corporation (“Anter”), a manufacturer of thermal analyzers used to measure thermal expansion and shrinkage, thermal conductivity and resistivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat capacity of a wide range of materials, especially
materials used in high temperature applications. Anter systems provide critical information to scientists that develop and characterize ceramics, metals and glasses for use in a wide-range of industries, including electronics, energy and aerospace.

TA Service

Similar
to the Waters Division, the servicing and support of TA’s instruments is an important source of revenue and represents approximately 25% of sales for the TA Division. TA sells, supports and services TA’s product offerings through its
headquarters in New Castle, Delaware. TA operates independently from the Waters Division, though several of its overseas offices are situated in Waters Division’s facilities. TA has dedicated field sales and service operations. Service sales
are primarily derived from the sale of support plans, replacement parts and from billed labor fees associated with the repair, maintenance and upgrade of installed systems.

Customers

The Company typically has a broad and diversified customer base that includes
pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts, universities and government agencies. The pharmaceutical segment represents the Company’s largest sector and includes multinational pharmaceutical companies, generic drug manufacturers,


contract research organizations (CROs) and biotechnology companies. The Company’s other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers, polymer manufacturers, food and beverage
companies and environmental testing laboratories. The Company also sells to various universities and government agencies worldwide. The Company’s technical support staff works closely with its customers in developing and implementing
applications that meet their full range of analytical requirements. During 2011, 52% of the Company’s sales were to pharmaceutical accounts, 33% to other industrial accounts and 15% to university and government agencies.

The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of
customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. The Company does not rely on any single customer or one group of customers for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, no single customer
accounted for more than 3% of the Company’s net sales.

Sales and Service

The Company has one of the largest sales and service organizations in the industry, focused exclusively on the various instrument systems’ installed base. Across these product technologies, using
respective specialized sales and service forces, the Company serves its customer base with 89 sales offices throughout the world as of December 31, 2011 and approximately 2,900, 2,700 and 2,700 field representatives in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The Company’s investment in sales and service in 2011 is primarily due to the growing installed base of customers. The Company’s sales representatives have direct responsibility for account relationships, while service
representatives work in the field to install instruments, train customers and minimize instrument downtime. In-house, technical support representatives work directly with customers, providing them assistance with applications and procedures on
Company products. The Company provides customers with comprehensive information through various corporate and regional internet websites and product literature, and also makes consumable products available through electronic ordering facilities and
a dedicated catalog.

Manufacturing and Distribution

The Company provides high quality LC products by overseeing each stage of the production of its instruments, columns and chemical reagents. The Company currently assembles a portion of its LC instruments
at its facility in Milford, Massachusetts, where it performs machining, assembly and testing. The Milford facility maintains quality management and environmental management systems in accordance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2008, ISO 13485:2003
and ISO 14001:2004, and adheres to applicable regulatory requirements (including the FDA Quality System Regulation and the European In-Vitro Diagnostic Directive). The Company outsources manufacturing of certain electronic components, such as
computers, monitors and circuit boards, to outside vendors that can meet the Company’s quality requirements. In addition, the Company outsources the manufacturing of certain LC instrument systems and components to well-established contract
manufacturing firms in Singapore. The Company’s Singapore entity manages all Asian outsourced manufacturing as well as the distribution of all products to Asia. The Company continues to pursue outsourcing opportunities as they may arise but
believes it maintains adequate supply chain and manufacturing capabilities in the event of disruption or natural disasters.

The Company manufactures and distributes its LC columns at its facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland, where it processes, sizes and treats silica and polymeric media that are packed
into columns, solid phase extraction cartridges and bulk shipping containers. The Wexford facility also manufactures and distributes certain data, instruments and software components for the Company’s LC, MS and TA product lines. The
Company’s Taunton facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008. The Wexford facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 13485:2003. VICAM

®

manufactures antibody resin and magnetic beads that are packed into columns and kits in Milford, Massachusetts and Nixa, Missouri. Environmental Resource Associates
manufactures environmental proficiency kits in Golden, Colorado. Thar manufactures SFC systems in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.


The Company manufactures and distributes its MS products at its facilities in Manchester,
England, Cheshire, England and Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the Company’s MS instruments are manufactured by long-standing outside contractors. Each stage of this supply chain is closely monitored by the Company to
maintain high quality and performance standards. The instruments, components or modules are then returned to the Company’s facilities where its engineers perform final assembly, calibrations to customer specifications and quality control
procedures. The Company’s MS facilities are certified to ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 13485:2003.

TA’s thermal analysis,
rheometry and calorimetry products are manufactured and distributed at the Company’s New Castle, Delaware, Lindon, Utah and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania facilities. During 2011, the Company closed TA’s Crawley, England facility and transferred
the manufacturing of these products to TA’s New Castle, Delaware facility. Similar to MS, elements of TA’s products are manufactured by outside contractors and are then returned to the Company’s facilities for final assembly,
calibration and quality control. The Company’s New Castle facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008 standards.

Research and Development

The Company maintains an active research and development program focused on the development and commercialization of products that both
complement and update its existing product offering. The Company’s research and development expenditures for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $92 million, $84 million and $77 million, respectively. Nearly all of the Company’s
current LC products are developed at the Company’s main research and development center located in Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the Company’s extensive field organizations and customers. The majority of the
Company’s MS products are developed at facilities in England and nearly all of the Company’s current thermal analysis products are developed at the Company’s research and development center in New Castle, Delaware. At
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were 741, 697 and 677 employees, respectively, involved in the Company’s research and development efforts. The Company has increased research and development expenses relating to acquisitions and the
Company’s continued commitment to invest significantly in new product development and existing product enhancements. Despite the Company’s active research and development programs, there can be no assurances that the Company’s product
development and commercialization efforts will be successful or that the products developed by the Company will be accepted by the marketplace.

Employees

The Company employed
approximately 5,700, 5,400 and 5,200 employees at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, with approximately 45% of the Company’s employees located in the United States. The Company believes its employee relations are generally
good. The Company’s employees are not unionized or affiliated with any internal or external labor organizations. The Company firmly believes that its future success largely depends upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled
employees.

Competition

The
analytical instrument systems market is highly competitive. The Company encounters competition from several worldwide manufacturers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets for each of its three technologies. The Company competes in
its markets primarily on the basis of product performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser extent, price. Some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company’s business, but are typically less
focused on the Company’s chosen markets. Some competitors have greater financial and other resources than the Company.

In the markets served by the Waters Division, the Company’s principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., Shimadzu
Corporation, Bruker Corporation, Danaher Corporation and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. In the markets served by the TA Division, the Company’s principal competitors include:


PerkinElmer, Inc., Mettler-Toledo International Inc., NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern Instruments Ltd., Anton-Paar and General Electric Company.

The market for consumable LC products, including separation columns, is highly competitive and more fragmented than the analytical
instruments market. The Company encounters competition in the consumable columns market from chemical companies that produce column chemicals and small specialized companies that pack and distribute columns. The Company believes that it is one of
the few suppliers that processes silica, packs columns and distributes its own product. The Company competes in this market on the basis of reproducibility, reputation, performance and, to a lesser extent, price. The Company’s principal
competitors for consumable products include: Phenomenex, Inc., Supelco, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., General Electric Company, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Merck and Co., Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to offer a predictable
level of performance when used with ACQUITY UPLC columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the ACQUITY UPLC instrument base will enhance its chromatographic column business because of the high level of synergy between ACQUITY UPLC
columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instrument. In 2009, Agilent Technologies, Inc. introduced a new LC system, which it termed a UHPLC, and which it has claimed has similar performance characteristics to Waters’ ACQUITY UPLC.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

The
Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents and has patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. Certain technology and software is licensed from third parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The
Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is, in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its
loss would materially affect the Company’s business as a whole.

Environmental Matters and Climate Change

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or operations that may have adverse
environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages resulting from sites of past
spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations and has operated its business in the past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. From time to time,
Company operations have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its operations, financial
condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws.

The Company is sensitive to
the growing global debate with respect to climate change. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company published its first sustainability report identifying the various actions and behaviors the Company has adopted concerning its commitment to both the
environment and the broader topic of social responsibility. An internal sustainability working group was formed and is functioning to develop increasingly robust data with respect to the Company’s utilization of carbon producing substances in
an effort to continuously reduce the Company’s carbon footprint. See Item 1A, Risk Factors—Effects of Climate Change, for more information on the potential significance of climate change legislation. See also Note 14 in the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about geographic areas.

Item 1A:

Risk Factors

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, the following:

Global economic conditions may decrease demand for the Company’s products and harm our financial results.

The Company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions. These changes in global economic conditions may
affect the demand for the Company’s products and services and may result in a decline in sales in the future. There can be no assurance that the strong demand for the Company’s products and services will continue in the future.

Disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the Company’s access to capital.

Financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have experienced times of extreme disruption in recent years, including, among other things, sharp
increases in the cost of new capital, credit rating downgrades and bailouts, severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets. Financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions, resulting in
large asset write-downs, higher costs of capital, rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money. There can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions. Any
future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the Company participates may impair the Company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility and impair its ability to
access sources of new capital. The Company’s cost of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur.

The Company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand, which may decrease for a number of reasons, many beyond the
Company’s control.

The demand for the Company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its LC, LC-MS, thermal
analysis, rheometry and calorimetry products; the timing and level of capital expenditures of the Company’s customers; changes in government regulations, particularly effecting drug, food and drinking water testing; funding available to
academic and government institutions; general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the Company’s major markets; and competitive considerations. The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter, as a
result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. There can be no assurance that the Company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely
impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of weakness in global economic conditions.

Additionally, the analytical instrument market may, from time to time, experience low sales growth. Approximately 52% of the
Company’s net sales in both 2011 and 2010, respectively, were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable industry conditions
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.


Competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the Company’s, which could
result in decreased sales.

The analytical instrument market and, in particular, the portion related to the Company’s HPLC, UPLC,
LC-MS, thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines, is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. The Company encounters competition from several international instrument manufacturers and other companies in both
domestic and foreign markets. Some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company’s business, but are typically less focused on the Company’s chosen markets. There can be no assurance that the
Company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the Company or that the Company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions. There can be no assurance that
the Company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against its competitors in the future.

The Company’s
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in the Company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the U.S.

The Company had approximately $991 million in debt and $1,281 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the Company also had
the ability to borrow an additional $419 million from its existing credit facilities. Most of the Company’s debt is in the U.S. There is a substantial cash requirement in the U.S. to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt
interest obligations, finance potential acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs. A majority of the Company’s cash is generated from foreign operations, with $1.2 billion of the Company’s cash held by foreign
subsidiaries. The Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the U.S. to address these requirements through (1) cash from U.S.
operations, (2) efficient and timely repatriation of cash from overseas, (3) the Company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility and (4) other sources obtained at an acceptable cost.

Debt covenants and the Company’s failure to comply with them could negatively impact the Company’s capital and financial results.

The Company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the Company’s ability to engage in certain activities
that could otherwise benefit the Company. These debt covenants include restrictions on the Company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements that may limit the Company’s ability to make dividend or other payments; secure
other indebtedness; enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the
Company’s debt agreements. The Company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on the Company’s future performance, which is subject to, but not limited to, prevailing economic conditions and
other factors, including factors that are beyond the Company’s control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.

Disruption of operations at Company manufacturing facilities could harm our financial condition.

The Company manufactures LC instruments at facilities in Milford, Massachusetts and through a subcontractor in Singapore; chemistry separation columns at its facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and
Wexford, Ireland; MS products at its facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire, England and Wexford, Ireland; thermal analysis products at its facilities in New Castle, Delaware and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; rheometry products at its facilities in
New Castle, Delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the Company’s acquisitions. Any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities, whether due to labor difficulties,
destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.


The Company’s international operations may be negatively affected by foreign political, regulatory
and economic changes, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

Approximately 71% and 70% of the Company’s net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively, were outside of the United States and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the
Company has considerable manufacturing operations in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as significant subcontractors located in Singapore. As a result, a significant portion of the Company’s sales and operations are subject to certain
risks, including adverse developments in the foreign political and economic environment, in particular, the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of European countries; the instability and possible dissolution of the Euro as
a single currency; sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices; tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in staffing and
managing foreign operations; and associated adverse operational, contractual and tax consequences.

Additionally, the
U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses, interest, taxes and net income varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to certain foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The loss of key members of management could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The operation of the Company requires managerial and operational expertise. None of the key management employees have an employment contract with the Company and there can be no assurance that such
individuals will remain with the Company. If, for any reason, such key personnel do not continue to be active in management, the Company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have an adverse and material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial
condition.

The Company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards
as material and patentable. However, there can be no assurance that any patents held by the Company will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company.
Conversely, there could be successful claims against the Company by third-party patent holders with respect to certain Company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties. The Company’s patents, including
those licensed from others, expire on various dates. If the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights, it could have an adverse and material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The Company’s business would suffer if the Company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply.

Most of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by the Company are available from a number of different suppliers; however, a number of items
are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have, at a minimum, a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the Company. A prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or
components could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely affect the Company’s business.

The Company’s sales would deteriorate if the Company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules.

Certain components or modules of the Company’s LC and MS instruments are manufactured by long-standing outside contractors, including the
manufacturing of LC instrument systems and related components by well-established contract manufacturing firms in Singapore. Disruptions of service by these outside contractors could


have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the Company. A prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations.

The Company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pre-tax income
between tax jurisdictions, which are unpredictable.

The Company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0% to in excess of 35%
in various jurisdictions in which it does business. In addition, the Company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections
caused by factors including, but not limited to, changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates, could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the Company’s income tax
expense, effective tax rate and results of operations.

The effects of climate change could harm the Company’s business.

The Company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemical and other substances that are regulated
under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. In the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory
authorities with respect to the use and/or levels of possible emissions from such chemicals and/or other substances, the Company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes. Any such changes could have a
material effect on the financial statements of the Company.

Another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the
severity of global weather conditions. The Company manufactures a growing percentage of its HPLC, UPLC and MS products in both Singapore and Wexford, Ireland. Severe weather conditions, including earthquakes, hurricanes and/or tsunami, could
potentially cause significant damage to the Company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries. The effects of such damage and the resultant disruption of manufacturing operations could have a materially adverse impact to the
financial results of the Company.

Compliance failures could harm the Company’s business.

The Company is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including, among others, health and safety,
import/export, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and environmental laws and regulations. A portion of the Company’s operations are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations are complex and
govern an array of product activities, including design, development, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. Any failure by the Company to comply with applicable government regulations could result in product recalls, the
imposition of fines, restrictions on the Company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations.

Some of the Company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacture, handling, use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances. This requires
the Company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations. If the Company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacture or distribution of its products, it could face civil and/or
criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant.

Some of
the Company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization. The Company must comply with these rules, as well as those of other agencies, such as those of the
United States Occupational Health and Safety Administration. Failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification and/or the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
operations.

Item 7:

Management’s

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business and Financial Overview

The Company has two operating
segments: the Waters Division and the TA Division (“TA

®

”). The Waters Division’s products and
services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC

®

” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products
and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, life science, biochemical, industrial, food, environmental, academic and
governmental customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability of fine chemicals, polymers and viscous
liquids in consumer goods and healthcare products.

The Company’s sales were $1,851 million, $1,643
million and $1,499 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Sales increased 13% in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 10% in 2010 as compared to 2009. In 2011, as compared with 2010, instrument system sales increased 14% while combined sales of
chemistry consumables and services increased 11%. These overall increases in 2011 sales were attributable to increased spending by the Company’s pharmaceutical, industrial and chemical analysis customers on new and existing LC, MS and TA
products. The sales growth in 2011 is also attributable to an increase in demand for the recently launched ACQUITY
UPLC

®

H-Class, Xevo

®

Q-Tof

TM

, Xevo

®

TQ-S and SYNAPT

®

G2-S instrument systems. Sales growth of these new instrument systems was achieved in all major regions of the
world. The effect of foreign currency translation increased sales by 3% in 2011. The Company expects the impact of foreign currency translation to be slightly negative to 2012 sales when compared to 2011 based on current exchange rates. The 2010
increase in sales when compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher demand for the Company’s products and services resulting from an improvement in global economic conditions, introduction of new


products, and an increase in pharmaceutical and industrial spending on the Company’s products. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales growth in 2010.

Waters Division sales increased 12% in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 9% in 2010 as compared to 2009. The effect of foreign currency
translation increased Waters Division sales by 3% in 2011 and had minimal impact on Waters Division sales in 2010. TA’s sales increased 16% in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 17% in 2010 as compared to 2009. The effect of foreign currency
translation increased TA sales by 3% in 2011 and had minimal impact on TA sales in 2010. The July 2011 acquisition of Anter Corporation (“Anter”) added 1% to TA’s sales in 2011 when compared to 2010.

Geographically, sales increased 16% in Europe, 13% in Asia (including Japan), 6% in the U.S. and 26% in the rest of the world during 2011
as compared with 2010. The effect of foreign currency translation increased sales in 2011 by 5% in Europe, 4% in Asia and 1% in the rest of the world. During 2010, as compared with 2009, sales increased 21% in Asia and 9% in the U.S., while sales
were flat in Europe and increased 13% in the rest of the world. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased sales in 2010 by 4% in Europe and increased sales by 4% in Asia and 3% in the rest of the world. Europe’s 2011 sales benefited
from strong demand from pharmaceutical and chemical analysis customers. Asia’s 2011 sales growth rate was not as high as the 2010 sales growth rate due to the impact of large regulatory pharmaceutical and food analysis shipments in China in
late 2010 and a slowdown in customer orders in India in late 2011, principally due to the devaluation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. The Company does not expect the impact of the India rupee devaluation to have a long-term effect on
sales.

In 2011, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 13% and combined sales to industrial and environmental customers
increased 15% as compared to 2010. These increases were primarily a result of increased spending on instrument systems, chemistry consumables and services by the Company’s customers and sales from the ACQUITY UPLC H-Class, Xevo Q-Tof, Xevo TQ-S
and SYNAPT G2-S instrument systems. In 2010, as compared to 2009, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 12% and sales to industrial, food safety and environmental customers increased 14%. These increases were primarily a result of increased
spending on instrument systems, chemistry consumables and services by the Company’s customers as global economic conditions improved as compared to the prior year. Combined global sales to government and academic customers were 5% higher in
both 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2010 as compared to 2009. These increases were primarily attributable to sales of newly introduced LC and LC-MS systems and strong global academic spending that occurred in Asia in 2010. In 2012, as a result of the
continuing austerity programs being put in place worldwide, the Company’s sales to governmental and academic customers may continue to lag behind the Company’s overall anticipated sales growth rate.

Operating income was $529 million, $450 million and $395 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The overall increase in operating
income in 2011 when compared to 2010 was primarily due to increases in sales volumes and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The overall increase in operating income in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily from increases in
sales volumes with relatively similar product mix and gross margin percentages. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $26 million and $6 million of the increases in operating income in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2010
compared to 2009, respectively. The Company expects the impact of foreign currency translation to be neutral or possibly decrease 2012 operating income when compared to 2011 based on current exchange rates.

Net income per diluted share was $4.69, $4.06 and $3.34 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net income per diluted share was primarily
impacted by the following factors in 2011, 2010 and 2009:

•

The benefits from higher sales volumes, product mix and the leveraging of lower growth in operating expenses.

•

The impact from the shift in pretax income between tax rate jurisdictions were negligible to the net income per diluted share in 2011 and increased net
income per diluted share by $0.14 in 2010 after excluding the one-time transactions noted below.


•

Foreign currency translation added $0.24 and $0.06 to net income per diluted share in 2011 and 2010, respectively. This benefit to net income per
diluted share is not expected to continue in 2012 as compared to 2011 at current exchange rates.

•

In 2010, an $8 million tax benefit was recorded related to the reversal for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom
and a $2 million tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits added $0.10 per diluted share in 2010.

•

A $6 million TA building lease termination expense recorded in 2009 increased selling and administrative expenses and lowered net income per diluted
share by $0.04 in 2009.

•

A $5 million tax benefit was recorded in 2009 related to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities and added $0.05 per diluted share in
2009.

The impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from the Company’s share repurchase program, offset by the incremental interest
expense on borrowings to repurchase those shares, increased net income per diluted share slightly in 2011 and increased net income per diluted share by $0.06 in 2010.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $497 million, $458 million and $418 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The $39
million increase in operating cash flow in 2011 when compared to 2010 was primarily the result of higher net income and was also impacted in 2011 by the payment of amounts earned under the Company’s 2010 management incentive plans. The increase
in operating cash flow in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily a result of higher net income, lower incentive compensation payments made in 2010 as compared to 2009, and payments made in 2009 for a $6 million litigation payment and $6 million TA
building lease termination.

Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures related to property, plant,
equipment and software capitalization were $85 million, $63 million and $94 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures were higher in 2011 due to a $14 million land acquisition in the United Kingdom, where the Company plans
to construct a new facility that will consolidate certain existing primary MS research, manufacturing and distribution locations. The Company expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $50 million to $70 million to
construct this facility. Capital expenditures were higher in 2009 due to the acquisition of land and construction of a new TA facility.

In January 2012, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Bahr Thermoanalyse GmbH (“Bahr”), a German manufacturer of a wide-range of thermal analyzers, for $12 million in
cash. The Company acquired the net assets of Anter for $11 million in cash in 2011. The Company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of Thar Instruments, Inc. (“Thar”) for $36 million in cash in 2009. The Company
continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to augment the Waters and TA operating divisions.

Within cash flows used in financing activities, the Company received $60 million, $101 million and $19 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Fluctuations in these
amounts were primarily attributable to changes in the Company’s stock price and the expiration of stock option grants. In February 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its
outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company repurchased $364 million, $292 million and $210 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under the February 2011 authorization and
previously announced stock repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to
further grow the Company’s sales and profits.

In July 2011, Waters entered into a new credit agreement (the “2011
Credit Agreement”). The 2011 Credit Agreement provides for a $700 million revolving facility and a $300 million term loan facility. The term loan


facility and the revolving facility both mature on July 28, 2016 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. In March 2011, the Company issued and sold senior unsecured notes with
a total face value of $200 million. The Company used the proceeds from the 2011 Credit Agreement and the issuances of senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. As a result of the issuances of senior
unsecured notes, the Company’s weighted-average interest rates have increased in 2011 due to higher rates paid on this fixed-rate debt.

Results of Operations

Year Ended
December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010

Net Sales

Product sales were $1,322 million and $1,167 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, an increase of 13%. The increase in product sales in 2011 was
primarily due to higher demand from the Company’s pharmaceutical, industrial and chemical analysis customers and strong uptake in sales from the ACQUITY UPLC H-Class, Xevo Q-Tof, Xevo TQ-S, SYNAPT G2-S, thermal analysis and rheology instrument
systems. The Company also benefited during 2011 from higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC columns, which are primarily used by an expanding installed base of ACQUITY UPLC instruments. In addition, foreign currency translation added 3% to product sales for
2011.

Service sales were $529 million and $477 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, an increase of 11%. The increase in
service sales in 2011 was primarily attributable to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. In addition, foreign currency translation added 3% to service sales for 2011.

Waters Division Net Sales

Waters
Division sales increased 12% in 2011 as compared to 2010. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division across all product lines, resulting in an increase in total sales of 3% in 2011.

Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS) increased 14% in 2011. The increase in instrument systems sales was primarily attributable to
higher demand from the Company’s pharmaceutical and industrial customers and the adoption and uptake in sales from the ACQUITY UPLC H-Class, Xevo Q-Tof and Xevo TQ-S instrument systems. Chemistry consumables sales increased 11% in 2011. These
increases were driven primarily by higher demand for chemistry consumable products, including increased sales of ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns. Waters Division service sales grew 11% in 2011 due to increased sales of service plans and billings to a
higher installed base of customers. Waters Division sales by product line in 2011 were 53% for instrument systems, 18% for chemistry consumables and 29% for service, as compared to 52% for instrument systems, 18% for chemistry consumables and 30%
for service in 2010.

Waters Division sales in Europe increased 16%, with the effect of foreign currency translation
increasing Europe’s sales by 5%. Waters Division sales in Europe benefited from strong demand from pharmaceutical and chemical analysis customers. Waters Division sales in Asia increased 13%; however, the sales growth rate was not as high as in
2010 due to the impact of large regulatory pharmaceutical and food analysis shipments in China in late 2010 and a slowdown in customer orders in India in late 2011 due to the devaluation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. The effects of
foreign currency translation increased Asia’s sales by 4%. Waters Division sales in the U.S. increased 5% and sales to the rest of the world increased 25%. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales in the rest of world.

TA Division Net Sales

TA’s sales were 16% higher in 2011 as compared to 2010. Instrument system sales increased 17% in 2011 and represented 76% of sales in 2011 as
compared to 75% in 2010. The increase in instrument system sales was primarily a result of higher demand for instrument systems from TA’s industrial customers due to improved economic conditions, as well as revenue associated with the shipment
of the new Discovery instrument systems.


TA service sales increased 14% in 2011 due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation added 3% to TA’s 2011
sales as compared to 2010 and the 2011 acquisition of Anter added 1% to sales in 2011. Geographically, TA’s sales increased in each territory.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for 2011 was $1,121 million compared to $990 million for 2010,
an increase of 13%. The increase in gross profit dollars in 2011 was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 60.5% in 2011 as compared to 60.2% in 2010 due to sales volume leveraging
manufacturing fixed costs and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales is
affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, product mix and product costs of instrument systems and associated software platforms. Beginning in 2012, the Company expects to introduce several new products and software platforms whose
cost and amortization of capitalized software development costs may affect the Company’s product mix and may lower associated gross profit margins slightly as a percentage of sales. See Note 6 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for estimated future amortization expense.

Selling and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses for 2011 and 2010 were $490 million and $445 million, respectively, an increase of 10%. The increase in selling and
administrative expenses in 2011 was a result of the Company’s investment in headcount additions, principally in sales and service; higher merit and fringe benefit costs; higher sales and incentive compensation costs; and foreign currency
translation. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 26.5% for 2011 compared to 27.1% for 2010.

Research
and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $92 million and $84 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, an increase
of 10%. The increase in research and development expenses in 2011 was primarily due to development costs incurred on new products and increased headcount.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $22 million and $14 million for 2011 and
2010, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2011 was primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings, as well as higher interest rates paid on fixed-rate debt.

Provision for Income Taxes

The four principal jurisdictions the Company manufactures in
are the U.S., Ireland, the United Kingdom and Singapore, where the effective tax rates are approximately 35%, 12.5%, 26.5% and 0%. The Company has a contractual tax rate in Singapore of 0% through the end of 2016, while the statutory tax rate in
Singapore is 17%. The Company’s effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors, including, but not limited to, the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates; sales volumes and profit levels in
each tax jurisdiction; changes in tax laws, tax rates and policies; and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation. As a result of variability in these factors, the Company’s effective tax rates in the future may not be similar
to the effective tax rates reported for 2011, 2010 or 2009.

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were
15.0% and 12.8%, respectively. Included in the income tax provision for 2011 is a $2 million tax benefit related to the reversal of a reserve for interest related to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom. This tax benefit decreased the
Company’s effective tax rate by 0.3 percentage points in 2011. Included in the 2010 income tax provision was an $8 million tax benefit related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the United
Kingdom and $2 million of tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits decreased the


Company’s effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points in 2010. The remaining difference between the effective tax rate for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to a slight
shift in pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with higher effective tax rates.

Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year
Ended December 31, 2009

Net Sales

Product sales were $1,167 million and $1,052 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of 11%. The increase in product sales in 2010 was primarily due to higher demand by the Company’s
customers as a result of improved economic conditions and an increase in sales from the recently introduced ACQUITY UPLC H-Class, SYNAPT G-2 and Xevo Q-Tof instrument systems. Service sales were $477 million and $447 million in 2010 and 2009,
respectively, an increase of 7%. The increase in service sales in 2010 was primarily attributable to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers.

Waters Division Net Sales

Waters Division sales increased 9% in 2010 as compared to
2009. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on Waters Division sales in 2010.

Waters instrument system sales (LC
and MS technology-based) increased 11% in 2010 and were primarily attributable to higher demand from the Company’s pharmaceutical, industrial, academic and government customers due to improvement in global economic conditions and the
introduction of the new ACQUITY UPLC H-Class, SYNAPT G-2 and Xevo Q-Tof instrument systems. Chemistry consumables sales increased 9% in 2010 and were driven primarily by higher demand for chemistry consumable products, specifically, the ACQUITY UPLC
columns. Waters Division service sales increased 6% in 2010 due to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Waters Division sales by product line in both 2010 and 2009 were 52% for instrument systems,
18% for chemistry consumables and 30% for service.

Waters Division sales in Europe decreased 1% in 2010 and the effects of
foreign currency translation decreased European sales by 3% in 2010. Waters Division sales in Asia increased 19% in 2010, primarily due to strong sales growth in China and India. The effects of foreign currency translation increased sales in Asia by
4% in 2010. Waters Division sales in the U.S. and the rest of the world increased 8% and 13%, respectively. The effects of foreign currency translation increased 2010 sales in the rest of world by 3%.

TA Division Net Sales

TA’s
sales were 17% higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily a result of higher demand for instrument systems from TA’s industrial customers due to improved economic conditions. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact
on TA’s 2010 sales as compared to 2009. Instrument system sales increased 19% in 2010 and represented 75% of sales in 2010 as compared to 74% in 2009. TA service sales increased 11% in 2010 primarily due to increased sales of service plans and
billings to a higher installed base of customers. Geographically, sales increased in each territory.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for 2010 was $990 million compared to $904 million for 2009, an increase of 10%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to
60.2% in 2010 as compared to 60.3% in 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars in 2010 was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes. During 2010, the Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales was slightly impacted by an
unfavorable change in the sales mix and the unfavorable impact of movements in certain foreign exchange rates between the currencies where the Company manufactures products and the currencies where the sales were transacted, principally the Euro,
Japanese Yen and British Pound. These declines in gross profit as a percentage of sales were mostly offset by the benefit of manufacturing product cost reductions and the benefit from manufacturing overhead absorption as a result of the increase in
sales volume.


Selling and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses for 2010 and 2009 were $445 million and $421 million, respectively, an increase of 6%. The increase in 2010 selling and administrative expenses includes merit,
merit-related fringe benefit and incentive compensation increases. These increases were offset by the impact of the $6 million TA building lease termination expense recorded in 2009 and an immaterial correction for certain incentive plan and other
accrual balances recorded in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 27.1% for 2010 compared to 28.1% for 2009.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $84 million and
$77 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of 9%. The increase in research and development expenses in 2010 was primarily due to costs incurred on new products launched in 2010.

Provision for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were
12.8% and 16.4%, respectively. Included in the 2010 income tax provision was an $8 million tax benefit related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom and $2 million of tax benefit
related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points in 2010. Included in the income tax provision for 2009 was a $5 million tax benefit related to
the reversal of a $5 million provision that was originally recorded in 2008, relating to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. The recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated
by the U.S. Treasury in February 2009. This tax benefit decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2009. The remaining difference between the effective tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable
to higher pre-tax income in lower tax rate jurisdictions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):


Cash Flow from Operating Activities

Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $497 million and $458 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 when compared to 2010 include the following significant changes in the
sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase in net income:

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and higher sales volumes
in 2011 as compared to 2010. Days-sales-outstanding (“DSO”) was 64 days at December 31, 2011 and 67 days at December 31, 2010.

•

The 2011 change in inventories was attributable to the increase in inventory related to the introduction of new products and associated spare parts
launched in 2011.

•

The 2011 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was a result of timing of payments to vendors and a decrease in income taxes payable
in the current year as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. The 2010 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was a result of increases in accounts payable and accrued income taxes.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2011 and 2010 was a result of the higher installed base of customers renewing
annual service contracts.

•

Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and
other liabilities.

Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009

Net cash provided by operating activities was $458 million and $418 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The changes within net
cash provided by operating activities in 2010 as compared to 2009 include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase in net income:

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and higher sales volumes
in 2010 as compared to 2009. DSO was 67 days at both December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

•

The 2010 change in inventories was attributed to the increase in inventory related to the ramp up in sales of new products launched in the second half
of 2010 and in early 2011.

•

The 2010 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was impacted by a higher accounts payable balance, higher incentive compensation
accruals and higher accrued interest balances, while the 2009 change was impacted by a $6 million litigation payment and a $6 million TA building lease termination payment. In addition, accounts payable and other current liabilities changed as a
result of timing of payments to vendors.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2010 and 2009 was a result of the higher installed base of customers renewing
annual service contracts.

•

Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and
other liabilities.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $356 million, $412 million and $419 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $85 million, $63
million and $94 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures were higher in 2011 due to a $14 million land


acquisition in the United Kingdom, where the Company plans to construct a new facility that will consolidate certain existing primary MS research, manufacturing and distribution locations. The
Company expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $50 million to $70 million to construct this facility. Capital expenditures were higher in 2009 due to the acquisition of land and construction of a new TA facility.

During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company purchased $1,749 million, $1,235 million and $518 million of short-term investments,
respectively, while $1,490 million, $886 million and $229 million of short-term investments matured, respectively. Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $11 million and $36 million during 2011 and 2009, respectively. There were no
business acquisitions in 2010.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

In July 2011, Waters entered into the 2011 Credit Agreement, which provides for a $700 million revolving facility and a $300 million term loan facility. The term loan facility and the
revolving facility both mature on July 28, 2016 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The Company uses the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. In July 2011, the Company borrowed $300 million
under the new term loan facility. The Company used the proceeds of the term loan and the revolving borrowings to repay the outstanding amounts under the credit agreement entered into in January 2007 (the “2007 Credit Agreement”). Waters
terminated the 2007 Credit Agreement early without penalty.

The interest rates applicable to the 2011 Credit Agreement are,
at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate (which is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 1/2%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or
12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 20 basis points and between 85 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. The facility fee on the
2011 Credit Agreement ranges between 15 basis points and 30 basis points. The 2011 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for
any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2011 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade
credit facilities. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets due to the
fact that the Company utilizes the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. It is the Company’s intention to pay the outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months following the respective
period end date, however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so.

The Company issued and sold senior
unsecured notes with a face value of $200 million in both 2011 and 2010. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. Interest on both issuances
of senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually. The Company may redeem some of the notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make-whole
amount. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In
addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default.

During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $225 million, $134 million and $92 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a total of $991
million in outstanding debt, which consisted of $400 million in outstanding notes, $300 million borrowed under a term loan facility under the 2011 Credit Agreement, $280 million borrowed under revolving credit facility under the 2011 Credit
Agreement and $11 million borrowed under various other short-term lines of credit. The outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets due to the


fact that the Company utilizes the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. It is the Company’s intention to pay the outstanding revolving line of credit balance during
the subsequent twelve months following the respective period end date; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under existing credit
agreements of $419 million after outstanding letters of credit.

In February 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company repurchased 4.5 million, 4.4 million and 4.5 million shares at a cost of $364
million, $292 million and $210 million, respectively, under the February 2011 authorization and previously announced programs. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had purchased an aggregate of 3.8 million shares at a cost of $314 million
under the February 2011 program, leaving $186 million authorized for future repurchases.

The Company received $60 million,
$101 million and $19 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. The majority of the
Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are generated from foreign operations, with $1.2 billion held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2011. Due to the fact that most of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments are held outside of the U.S., the Company must manage and maintain sufficient levels of cash flow in the U.S. to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt and interest, finance potential U.S. acquisitions and
continue to repurchase shares under the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S. These U.S. cash requirements are managed by the Company’s cash flow from U.S. operations and the use of the Company’s revolving credit facilities.

Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position, along with expected future cash flows from
earnings based on historical trends, the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements,
authorized share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following is a summary of the
Company’s known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands):

(1)

Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of business and uncertain tax positions discussed below.

The interest rates applicable to term loan and revolving loans under the 2011 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the
base rate (which is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 1/2%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate
margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 20 basis points and between 85 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. The


facility fee on the 2011 Credit Agreement ranges between 15 basis points and 30 basis points. The 2011 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of
not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2011 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and
warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties and the licenses expire at
various dates through 2012. Fees paid for licenses were less than $1 million in each of the years 2011, 2010 and 2009. Future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2011 are immaterial.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course
of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of
operations. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10-K.

The Company has long-term liabilities for
deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the
Company and whether the employee elects lump-sum or annuity payments. During fiscal year 2012, the Company expects to contribute approximately $7 million to $9 million to the Company’s defined benefit plans.

In order to accommodate future sales growth, the Company purchased land in the United Kingdom for $14 million in 2011 to consolidate
certain existing primary MS research, manufacturing and distribution locations in the United Kingdom into one facility. The Company expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $50 million to $70 million to construct
this facility. The Company believes it can fund the construction of this facility with cash flows from operating activities and its borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities.

The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standard for income taxes, which
requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all
of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. If all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2011 were to become
recognizable in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of approximately $73 million in its income tax provision. The Company’s uncertain tax positions are taken with respect to income tax return reporting periods beginning after
December 31, 1999, which are the periods that generally remain open to income tax audit examination by the concerned income tax authorities. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments
for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, the Company does not expect to record any material changes in the
measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the settlement of tax audit examinations within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2011, the Company does expect,
however, to record a reduction in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of approximately $4 million due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments within the next twelve
months.


The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the
foreseeable future.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not
consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests,
derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity,
market risk or credit risk support to the Company.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its
ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners
or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the
performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend
lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Summary

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations that require
management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of
different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and
other items could potentially have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. The
Company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance and prior to shipment of the instrument. At December 31, 2011, the Company
had current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities of $110 million and $25 million, respectively. Revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
delivery has occurred; the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. Shipping and handling costs are
included in cost of sales, net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order.

Product shipments, including those for
demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. The


Company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company structures its sales arrangements as shipping point or
international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue upon shipment. In some cases, destination based shipping terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue is generally recognized when the products arrive at the customer
site.

The Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with
multiple-element revenue recognition accounting standards. With respect to the installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is
recognized as a multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of
amounts charged by third parties.

Instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance
period. The amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed.
No revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Sales of software are accounted for in
accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition. The Company’s software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts. Software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable, and there are no significant post-delivery obligations remaining. The revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized
ratably over the maintenance term. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. The Company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction
includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered element (maintenance) is deferred and the remaining portion of the
arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element (software license) and is recognized as revenue.

Loss Provisions on Accounts
Receivable and Inventory

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request
collateral from its customers, but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, past transaction history
with the customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro-economic environment. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product
returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful
accounts. The Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2011 was $367 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $9 million.

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis (“FIFO”). The Company
estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand, including that in the Company’s current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. If actual future
demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. The Company’s inventory balance at December 31, 2011 was recorded at its net realizable value of $213 million,
which is net of write-downs of $14 million.


Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, particularly as it pertains to capitalized software;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends, competitive products and technologies; and

•

significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Company’s capitalized patents,
trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses.

When the Company determines that the carrying
value of an individual intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset, long-lived
asset or goodwill, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the
asset is written-down to its estimated fair value. Net intangible assets, long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $192 million, $237 million and $297 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2011.

The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on January 1 of each year. For goodwill impairment review purposes,
the Company has two reporting units, the Waters Division and TA Division. The Company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future; however, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are
completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. The factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

significant decline in the Company’s projected revenue, earnings or cash flows;

•

significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate;

•

significant decline in the Company’s stock price or the stock price of comparable companies;

•

adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and

•

unanticipated competition.

Warranty

Product warranties are
recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the
Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from
the Company’s previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2011, the Company’s warranty liability was $13 million.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements,
the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting
from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance
sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position
and results of operations.


The accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the
necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the Company accounts for
its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption
that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. At
December 31, 2011, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $73 million.

Litigation

As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10-K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With
respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a
loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional
exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation.

With respect to the claims referenced in
Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10-K, management of the Company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to certain claims. As developments occur in these matters and
additional information becomes available, management of the Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the Company’s
results of operations or financial position.

Pension and Other Retirement Benefits

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Company’s pension plans and other retirement
benefits are evaluated periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets, are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.20% for its U.S. benefit plans and 2.50% for its non-U.S. benefit plans.

At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could
be effectively settled. The Company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer Pension Discount Curve for high quality investments as of December 31, 2011 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows
for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once the interest rates were determined, the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. At December 31, 2011, the Company determined the
weighted-average discount rate to be 4.33% for the U.S. benefit plans and 3.29% for the non-U.S. benefits plans.

A
one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one-quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate
of return would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million.

Stock-based Compensation

The accounting
standard for stock-based compensation requires that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company has used the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock
option awards. Under the fair-value recognition provisions of this


statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of
share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the
Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of the expense has
been reduced for estimated forfeitures. This accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated
based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard, the compensation expense that the Company records in future periods may differ significantly from what
the Company has recorded in the current period.

The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted
under the stock-based compensation accounting standard and, consequently, has not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified transition method, compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior
to December 31, 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method.

As of December 31, 2011, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted-average lives over which the costs will be amortized
were as follows (in millions):

Recent Accounting Standard Changes and Developments

Information regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this document and should
be considered an integral part of this Item 7. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards.

Item 7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and
interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Company’s overall risk management guidelines.

The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange-rate risk with respect to certain inter-company balances, forecasted transactions
and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting
exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations.

The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
The Company’s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and


floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the
Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount.

Hedge Transactions

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with the
accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value hedge, the
changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the
derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. In addition, disclosures required for derivative
instruments and hedging activities include the Company’s objectives for using derivative instruments, the level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the
Company’s financial position and performance.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to
foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency and
interest rate exposures. The Company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair-value, cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions. In addition, the Company considers the impact of its counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the
contracts. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows
associated with the hedged items.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company used interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In August 2007, the
Company entered into two floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October 2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt.
The Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a change of $2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest
rate agreements and recorded additional interest expense of $2 million.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter-company balances and short-term assets and liabilities. Principal
hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts, which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying
exposures. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts
with notional amounts totaling $161 million, $136 million and $138 million, respectively.


The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts included in the consolidated balance
sheets are classified as follows (in thousands):

December 31, 2011

December 31, 2010

Other current assets

$


$


Other current liabilities

$

1,317

$


The following is a summary of the activity in the statements of operations related to the forward foreign
exchange contracts (in thousands):

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the
U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2011 would decrease pre-tax earnings by approximately $16 million.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with
original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in bank deposits, U.S. treasury bills, U.S. treasury bill money market funds, Canadian U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills, commercial paper and European government bond money market funds.
Investments with longer maturities are classified as short-term investments, and are held primarily in bank deposits, investment grade commercial paper and U.S., Canadian, German and Dutch government treasury bills. The Company maintains balances in
various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, $1,200 million out of $1,281 million and $901
million out of $946 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to material tax repatriation effects. As of December 31, 2011, the
Company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles, collateralized debt obligation conduits or asset-backed conduits.

The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short
maturities of these instruments. As of December 31, 2011, the carrying value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value.


Item 8:

Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and of cash flows present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control —Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1    Description of Business and Organization

Waters Corporation (“Waters

®

” or the “Company”) is an analytical instrument manufacturer that primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters Division, high
performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC

®

”
and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These
systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using a common software platform and are used along with other analytical instruments. LC is a standard technique
and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS instruments are used in drug discovery and
development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), food safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and
separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. Through its TA Division
(“TA

®

”), the Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry
and calorimetry instruments, which are used in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a
developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument system.

2    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, product returns and allowances, bad debts, inventory valuation, equity
investments, goodwill and intangible assets, warranty and installation provisions, income taxes, contingencies, litigation, retirement plan obligations and stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial
market conditions, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, risk of disruption, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, compliance
with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies and changes in the fair value of the underlying assets of the Company’s defined benefit plans.

Principles of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All material
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Translation of Foreign Currencies

For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are
translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s net sales derived from
operations outside the United States were 71% in 2011, 70% in 2010 and 69% in 2009. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for the years
presented.

Seasonality of Business

The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year
end.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cash equivalents primarily represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in bank deposits, U.S. treasury bills, U.S. treasury bill money market funds,
Canadian U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills, commercial paper and European government bond money market funds. Investments with longer maturities are classified as short-term investments, and are held primarily in bank deposits, investment grade
commercial paper and U.S., Canadian, German and Dutch government treasury bills. The Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than U.S.
dollars. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, $1,200 million out of $1,281 million and $901 million out of $946 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries
and may be subject to material tax repatriation effects.

Short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale in
accordance with the accounting standard for investments in debt and equity securities. All available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair market value and any unrealized holding gains and losses, to the extent deemed temporary, are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity, net of the related tax effects. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment, the Company considers all available evidence to evaluate the
extent to which the decline is “other than temporary” and marks the investment to market through a charge to the statement of operations. The Company classifies its investments as short-term investments exclusive of those categorized as
cash equivalents. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had short-term investments with a cost of $897 million and $638 million, respectively, which approximated market value.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are
recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number of factors, including
historical experience and the customer’s credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for
collectibility. Account balances are charged against the allowance when the Company feels it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for doubtful
accounts and sales returns for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products and services to a significant number of large and small customers throughout the world, with net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately 52% in 2011, 52% in
2010 and 51% in 2009. None of the Company’s individual customers accounted for more than 3% of annual Company sales in 2011, 2010 or 2009. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral, but in certain circumstances may require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

Inventory

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a
first-in, first-out basis (“FIFO”).

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A
liability has also been recorded to recognize uncertain tax return reporting positions.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, while the costs of significant
improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings — fifteen to thirty years; building improvements — five to ten years; leasehold
improvements — the shorter of the economic useful life or life of lease; and production and other equipment — three to ten years. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related accumulated
depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated balance sheets and related gains or losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no material gains or losses from retirement or sale of assets in 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Asset Impairments

The
Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with the accounting standard for property, plant and equipment. Whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company
evaluates the fair value of the asset, relying on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. Any change in the carrying amount of an asset as a
result of the Company’s evaluation is separately identified in the consolidated statements of operations.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests for goodwill impairment using a fair-value approach at the reporting unit level annually, or earlier, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce
the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additionally, the Company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment for its reporting units as of January 1 each year. The goodwill and other intangible assets accounting
standard defines a reporting unit as an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by management. For goodwill impairment review purposes, the Company has two reporting
units, the Waters Division and TA Division. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition. Under the impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value of reporting units was estimated using a discounted cash flows technique, which includes certain management assumptions,
such as estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and discount rates.

The Company’s intangible assets include
purchased technology; capitalized software development costs; costs associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses; debt issuance costs and acquired in-process research and development
(“IPR&D”). Purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years. Other intangibles are amortized over a period
ranging from one to thirteen years. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the related debt. Acquired IPR&D is amortized from the date of completion over its estimated useful life. In addition, acquired IPR&D will be tested for
impairment until completion of the acquired programs.

Software Development Costs

The Company capitalizes internal and external software development costs for products offered for sale in accordance with the accounting standard for the
costs of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. Capitalized costs are amortized to cost of sales over the period of economic benefit, which approximates a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software
products, generally three to five years. The Company capitalized $29 million of direct expenses that were related to the development of software in both 2011 and 2010. Net capitalized software included in intangible assets totaled $115 million
and $103 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, see Note 6, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles”.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs in accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible
assets. Capitalized internal software development costs are amortized over the period of economic benefit which approximates a straight-line basis over ten years. Net capitalized internal software included in property, plant and equipment totaled
$3 million and $4 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Investments

The Company accounts for its investments that represent less than twenty percent ownership, and for which the Company does not have significant influence,
using the accounting standard for investments in debt and equity securities. Investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, and for which there is not a readily determinable market value, are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. For
investments in which the Company owns or controls between twenty and forty-nine percent of the voting shares, or over which it exerts significant influence over operating and financial policies, the equity method of accounting is used. The
Company’s share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in the consolidated statements of


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operations and was not material in any period presented. All investments at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are included in other assets and amounted to $4 million for both years.

Fair Value Measurements

In
accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Fair values determined
by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair
values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31,
2011 (in thousands):


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis at December 31, 2010 (in thousands):

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities have been classified as Level 2. These assets and
liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit
spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing
sources. The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, short-term investments, 401(k) restoration plan assets and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2.
After completing these validation procedures, the Company did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by third-party pricing services as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments

The Company’s cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The
carrying value and fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $400 million and $410 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011. The carrying value and fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $200
million and $203 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.

Hedge Transactions

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be adversely impacted
by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates.

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with
the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value hedge, the


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective
portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. In
addition, disclosures required for derivative instruments and hedging activities include the Company’s objectives for using derivative instruments, the level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as how derivative instruments
and related hedged items affect the Company’s financial position and performance.

The Company currently uses derivative
instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the
impact of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets
and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions. In addition, the Company considers the impact of its counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party
to execute under the contracts. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company has used interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In August 2007, the
Company entered into two floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October 2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt.
The Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a change of $2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest
rate agreements and recorded additional interest expense of $2 million.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter-company balances and short-term assets and liabilities. Principal
hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts, which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying
exposures. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts
with notional amounts totaling $161 million, $136 million and $138 million, respectively.

The following is a summary of the activity in the statements of operations related to
the forward foreign exchange contracts (in thousands):

Stockholders’ Equity

In February 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During 2011, the Company repurchased
3.8 million shares at a cost of $314 million under this program, leaving $186 million authorized for future purchases.

During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company repurchased 4.5 million, 4.4 million and 4.5 million shares at a cost of $364
million, $292 million and $210 million, respectively, under the February 2011 authorization and previously announced programs. The Company believes it has the resources to fund the common stock repurchases as well as to pursue acquisition
opportunities in the future.

On August 9, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of a stock purchase rights
plan where a dividend of one fractional preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) was declared for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company. The dividend was paid on August 27, 2002 to
the stockholders of record on that date. The Rights, which expire on August 27, 2012, become exercisable only under certain conditions. When they first become exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to buy from Waters one one-hundredth
of a share of new Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (authorized limit of 4,000) for $120.00. When a person or group actually has acquired 15% or more of Waters’ common stock, the Rights will then become exercisable for a number
of shares of Waters’ common stock with a market value of twice the $120.00 exercise price of each Right. In addition, the Rights will then become exercisable for a number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company with a market value of
twice the $120.00 exercise price per Right. The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at a price of $0.001 per Right up until 10 days following a public announcement that any person or group has acquired 15% or more of the
Company’s common stock.

Revenue Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. The Company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of
the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance prior to shipment of the instrument. Revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists; delivery has occurred; the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. Shipping and handling
costs are included in cost of sales, net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order.

Product shipments, including
those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. The Company generally recognizes product revenue when legal
title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company structures its sales arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue upon shipment. In some cases, destination based shipping
terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue is generally recognized when the products arrive at the customer site.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in
accordance with the multiple-element revenue recognition accounting standards. With respect to the installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is
shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation
hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties.

Instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the
maintenance period. The amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service
is performed. No revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Sales of software are accounted for in
accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition. The Company’s software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts. Software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable, and there are no significant post-delivery obligations remaining. The revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized
ratably over the maintenance term. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. The Company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction
includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered element (maintenance) is deferred and the remaining portion of the
arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element (software license) and recognized as revenue.

Returns and customer credits are
infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales arrangements. Revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized before the customer acceptance
criteria are satisfied. Discounts from list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales.

Product Warranty Costs

The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of
operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure
rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and
estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

The following is a
summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Advertising Costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expenses for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were
$11 million, $10 million and $10 million, respectively.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and benefits,
facilities costs, overhead costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company
has two stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 10, “Stock-Based Compensation”.

Earnings Per Share

In accordance with the earnings per share accounting standard, the Company presents two earnings per share (“EPS”) amounts.
Income per basic common share is based on income available to common shareholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Income per diluted common share includes additional dilution from potential
common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding.

Comprehensive Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with the accounting standards for comprehensive income, which establish the accounting rules
for reporting and displaying comprehensive income. The standard requires that all components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements.

Subsequent Events

The Company did not
have any material subsequent events, except for the recent acquisition discussed in Note 5, “Acquisitions”.

Recently Adopted
Accounting Standards

In October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This
consensus amends existing revenue recognition accounting standards. This consensus provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple-deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration
allocated. This guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management’s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered
item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item. The previously existing accounting consensus required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction
between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor. Under the previous accounting consensus, if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable, then
revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined. The new approach is effective


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect
on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Also in October 2009, a new accounting
consensus was issued for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. This new consensus amends the previous accounting guidance for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software. This new consensus requires that
tangible products which contain software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance. This new approach is
effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2011, a new accounting standard was issued relating to the presentation of comprehensive income. This standard eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as
part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. An entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous
statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This standard is to be applied retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard will not have
a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2011,
amended accounting guidance was issued for goodwill in order to simplify how companies test goodwill for impairment. The amendments permit a company to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than
50 percent. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, a company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test
is unnecessary. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this accounting
pronouncement to have a material effect on our financial statements when implemented.

3    Inventories

Inventories are classified as follows (in thousands):


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

4    Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):

During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company retired and disposed of approximately $6 million,
$9 million and $7 million of property, plant and equipment, respectively, most of which was fully depreciated and no longer in use. Gains and losses on disposal were immaterial.

5    Acquisitions

In January 2012, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Bahr Thermoanalyse GmbH (“Bahr”), a German
manufacturer of a wide-range of thermal analyzers, for $12 million in cash. This acquisition will be accounted for under the accounting standard for business combinations and the results of this acquisition will be included in the Company’s
consolidated results from the acquisition date.

In July 2011, the Company acquired the net assets of Anter Corporation
(“Anter”), a manufacturer of thermal analyzers used to measure thermal expansion and shrinkage, thermal conductivity and resistivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat capacity of a wide range of materials, for $11 million in
cash. Anter was acquired to expand TA’s thermal analysis instrument product offering and to leverage the Company’s distribution channels. This acquisition was accounted for under the accounting standard for business combinations and
Anter’s results have been included in the consolidated results of the Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair
values. The Company has allocated $4 million of the purchase price to intangible assets comprised of customer relationships and acquired technology. The Company is amortizing the customer relationships over six years and the acquired technology over
ten years. These intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average period of nine years. The remaining purchase price of $6 million has been accounted for as goodwill. The principal factor that resulted in recognition of goodwill was
that the purchase price for the acquisition was based in part on cash flow projections assuming the integration of any acquired technology and products with our products, which is of considerably greater value than utilizing each of the acquired
company’s technology or products on a stand-alone basis. The goodwill also includes value assigned to assembled workforce, which cannot be recognized as an intangible asset. The sellers also have provided the Company with customary
representations, warranties and indemnification, which would be settled in the future if and when the contractual representation or warranty condition occurs. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Anter is expected to add approximately $6
million on a full-year basis to the Company’s annual sales. Anter’s impact on the Company’s net income since the acquisition date for the year ended December 31, 2011 was not significant.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table presents the fair values, as determined by the Company, of 100% of
the assets and liabilities owned and recorded in connection with the Anter acquisition (in thousands):

In February 2009, the Company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of Thar Instruments, Inc.
(“Thar”), a privately-held global leader in the design, development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction (“SFC”) systems, for $36 million in cash,
including the assumption of $4 million of debt. The acquisition of Thar was accounted for under the accounting standard for business combinations and the results of Thar have been included in the consolidated results of the Company from the
acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The Company has allocated $24 million of the purchase price to intangible assets
comprised of customer relationships, non-compete agreements, acquired technology, IPR&D and other purchased intangibles. These intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average period of 13 years. Included in intangible assets
is a trademark in the amount of $4 million, which has been assigned an indefinite life. The excess purchase price of $22 million has been accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The pro forma effect of the ongoing operations for Waters, Anter, and Thar as though these acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of
the periods covered by this report is immaterial.

6    Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The carrying amount of goodwill was $297 million and $292 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The
Company’s acquisition of Anter increased goodwill by $6 million (See Note 5) and currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by $1 million in 2011.

The Company’s intangible assets included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (in thousands):


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company acquired $4 million of
purchased intangibles as a result of the acquisition of Anter. In addition, the gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets decreased by $6 million and $5 million, respectively, in the year ended
December 31, 2011 due to the effect of foreign currency translation.

For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010
and 2009, amortization expense for intangible assets was $30 million, $28 million and $25 million, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be approximately $32 million for 2012 and is estimated to increase to
approximately $45 million per year for the years 2013 through 2016. The estimated significant increases in amortization expense are due to amortization associated with capitalized software costs related to the launch of new software product
platforms planned in the fourth quarter of 2012. The carrying value of the new software platform is approximately $83 million as of December 31, 2011 and will be amortized over ten years.

7    Debt

In July 2011, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the “2011 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $700 million
revolving facility and a $300 million in term loan facility. The revolving facility and term loan facility both mature on July 28, 2016 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The Company used $425 million of the proceeds from
the 2011 Credit Agreement to repay the outstanding amounts under the Company’s existing multi-borrower credit agreement dated as of January 11, 2007 (the “2007 Credit Agreement”). Waters terminated the 2007 Credit Agreement early
without penalty.

The interest rates applicable to the 2011 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to
either the base rate (which is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 1/2%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest
rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 20 basis points and between 85 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. The facility fee on the 2011 Credit Agreement ranges between 15 basis points and
30 basis points. The 2011 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters,
respectively, the same as the 2007 Credit Agreement. In addition, the 2011 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit
facilities. The outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets due to the fact that the Company utilizes the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital
needs. It is the Company’s intention to pay the outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months following the respective period end date.

The Company issued and sold the following senior unsecured notes in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:

The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other
outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less

than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the note purchase agreement) of the Company, the
Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less
than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, these notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and
events of default.

As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.

The Company had the following outstanding debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had a total amount available to borrow of $419 million
and $543 million, respectively, after outstanding letters of credit, under the 2011 Credit Agreement and 2007 Credit Agreement. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings were 2.33%
and 1.69% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in the weighted-average interest rate for the Company’s long-term debt is primarily due to a higher mix of fixed-rate debt and an increase in the interest rate credit
margin on the 2011 Credit Agreement.

The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit
totaling $109 million and $111 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the weighted-average interest rates
applicable to the short-term borrowings were 2.02% and 2.10%, respectively.

Income tax data for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows (in thousands):


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards which give rise to deferred tax assets and
deferred tax (liabilities) are summarized as follows (in thousands):


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Net deferred tax assets of $56 million and $48 million are included in other
current assets and $24 million and $20 million are included in other assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The Company’s deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss, tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credits are comprised of the following at December 31, 2011: less than
$1 million benefit of U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2020 and 2012, respectively; $14 million in research and development credits that begin to expire in 2012; and less than $1 million
($2 million pre-tax) in foreign net operating losses, which do not expire under current law.

As of December 31,
2009, the Company had provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of $84 million, principally against foreign tax credits ($71 million), certain foreign net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. During the year ended
December 31, 2010, the Company realized a benefit of $12 million from electing tax deduction rather than tax credit treatment with respect to portions of its foreign tax credit carryforward and determined that it would similarly realize an
additional benefit of $14 million in the future for the remainder of this deferred tax asset. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company released the $71 million valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset
associated with the foreign tax credit carryforward, reduced the deferred tax asset associated with the foreign tax credit carryforward by $57 million (reduced to $14 million), reduced accrued taxes by $12 million and increased additional paid-in
capital by $26 million. The Company increased additional paid-in capital because the valuation allowance that was originally established against this deferred tax asset was recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital. With the filing of
the Company’s U.S. tax return for the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company will have fully realized the remaining $14 million value of this deferred tax asset.

The income tax benefits associated with non-qualified stock option compensation expense recognized for tax purposes and credited to additional paid-in capital were $32 million, $11 million and
$5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

At December 31, 2011, there
were unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $2 billion. The Company has not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on these earnings as it is the Company’s current intention to permanently
reinvest these earnings outside the U.S.

The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance
with the accounting standard for income taxes, which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of those tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of
those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibits any discounting of those unrecognized tax benefits for the time value of money.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2011,
2010 and 2009 (in thousands):


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a net $8 million tax
benefit in the income tax provision which represents the realization of a reserve for uncertain United Kingdom tax benefits net of the net audit settlement. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded $2 million of tax
benefit in the income tax provision related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax exposure. Included in the income tax provision for the year ended 2009 is approximately $5 million of tax benefit related to the reversal of a $5 million tax
provision that was originally recorded in 2008, relating to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. The recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury in
February 2009.

The Company’s uncertain tax positions are taken with respect to income tax return reporting periods
beginning after December 31, 1999, which are the periods that generally remain open to income tax audit examination by the concerned income tax authorities. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential
tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, the Company does not expect to record any material
changes in the measurement of any other unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the settlement of tax audit examinations and the Company has not received any indication that a
settlement is expected within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2011, the Company does expect, however, to record a reduction in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of approximately $4
million due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments within the next twelve months.

The
Company’s effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 15.0%, 12.8% and 16.4%, respectively. Included in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2011 is $2 million of tax benefit
related to the reversal of reserves for interest related to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom. This tax benefit decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 0.3 percentage points in the year ended December 31, 2011. Included in
the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2010 is the aforementioned $8 million tax benefit related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom and the aforementioned
$2 million of tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points in the year ended December 31, 2010. Included in the income tax
provision for the year ended December 31, 2009 is the aforementioned $5 million of tax benefit related to the reversal of a $5 million provision that was originally recorded in 2008, related to the reorganization of certain foreign legal
entities. The tax benefit in 2009 decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in the year ended December 31, 2009. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were primarily
attributable to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates.

9    Other Commitments and Contingencies

Lease agreements, expiring at various dates through 2026, cover buildings, office equipment and automobiles. Rental expense was $28
million, $27 million and $34 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Future minimum rents payable as of December 31, 2011 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year are as

2011 are immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2012 and thereafter.

From time to time, the Company and its
subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the
aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

The Company enters into
standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party,
generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property
damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited.
Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.

10    Stock-Based Compensation

In May 2003, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (“2003 Plan”). As of
December 31, 2011, the 2003 Plan has 1.4 million shares available for granting in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types
of awards. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock unit conversion. Under the 2003 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock
at the date of grant. The 2003 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 4, 2013. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units may be
issued under the 2003 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. No award of restricted stock may have a restriction period of less than three years except as may be recommended by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or with respect to any award of restricted stock which provides solely for a performance-based risk of forfeiture so long as such award has a restriction period of at least one year. As of
December 31, 2011, the Company had stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards outstanding.

In
February 2009, the Company adopted its 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible employees may contribute up to 15% of their earnings toward the quarterly purchase of the Company’s common stock. The plan makes available
0.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock, which includes the remaining shares available under the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2011, 1.1 million shares have been issued under both the 2009 and
1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plans. Each plan period lasts three months beginning on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. The purchase price for each share of stock is the lesser of 90% of the market price on
the first day of the plan period or 100% of the market price on the last day of the plan period. Stock-based compensation expense related to this plan was $1 million, less than $1 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011,
2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting
standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The stock-based compensation accounting standards require forfeitures to be
estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates,
stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of this standard, the compensation expense that the Company
records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period.

The
consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards and the employee
stock purchase plan (in thousands):

As of both December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has capitalized stock-based compensation costs of
less than $1 million in inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. As of both December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has capitalized stock-based compensation costs of $3 million in capitalized software in the consolidated balance sheets.

Stock Options

In
determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate
indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience
for the population of non-qualified stock optionees. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes
model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were $45 million, $38 million and $36 million of total unrecognized
compensation costs related to unvested stock option awards that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.8 years.

Restricted Stock

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company
granted 12 thousand, 12 thousand and 8 thousand shares of restricted stock. The restrictions on these shares lapse at the end of a three-year period. The weighted-average fair value on the grant date of the restricted stock granted in
2011, 2010 and 2009 was $78.10, $61.63 and $38.09, respectively. The Company has recorded $1 million, $1 million and less than $1 million of compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to the
restricted stock grants. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has 32 thousand unvested shares of restricted stock outstanding with a total of $1 million of unrecognized compensation costs. These costs are expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

13    Retirement Plans

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters Employee Investment Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution plan, immediately
upon hire. Employees may contribute from 1% to 30% of eligible pay on a pre-tax basis and the Company makes matching contributions of 100% for contributions up to 6% of eligible pay. Employees are 100% vested in employee and Company matching
contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company’s matching contributions amounted to $12 million, $11 million and $10 million, respectively. In addition, the Company also sponsors various
other employee benefit plans (primarily defined contribution plans) outside the United States. The Company contributed $12 million, $11 million and $10 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to these non-U.S. plans.

The Company also sponsors other employee benefit plans in the U.S., including a retiree healthcare plan, which provides reimbursement for
medical expenses and is contributory. There are various non-U.S. retirement plans sponsored by the Company. The eligibility and vesting of the non-U.S. plans are generally consistent with local laws and regulations.

The net periodic pension cost is made up of several components that reflect different aspects of the Company’s financial
arrangements as well as the cost of benefits earned by employees. These components are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method and are based on certain actuarial assumptions. The Company’s accounting policy is to
reflect in the projected benefit obligation all benefit changes to which the Company is committed as of the current valuation date; use a market-related value of assets to determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior service costs on a
straight-line basis over the expected future service of active participants as of the date such costs are first recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related value of plan assets
and the projected benefit obligation over the expected future service of active participants.

portfolio returns with at least a return of 2.5% above the one-year constant maturity Treasury bond yield over reasonable measurement periods and based on reasonable market cycles.

Within the equity portfolio of the U.S. retirement plans, investments are diversified among market capitalization and investment
strategy. The Company targets a 20% allocation of its U.S. retirement plans’ equity portfolio to be invested in financial markets outside of the United States. The Company does not invest in its own stock within the U.S. retirement

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company
considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio and historical expenses paid by the plan. A one-quarter percentage point increase in the
assumed long-term rate of return on assets would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the
Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million.

During fiscal year
2012, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $7 million to $9 million to the Company’s defined benefit plans.

14    Business Segment Information

The accounting standard for segment reporting establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual
financial statements and requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports of public business enterprises. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic
areas and major customers. The Company’s business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision makers. As a result of this evaluation, the Company
determined that it has two operating segments: Waters Division and TA Division.

Waters Division is primarily in the business
of designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. TA Division is primarily in the business of designing,
manufacturing, distributing and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two divisions are its operating segments and each has similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services;
types and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated
financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company.

The Company’s unaudited quarterly results are summarized below (in thousands, except per share data):


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a
result of purchasing habits on capital goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. Selling and administrative expenses are typically higher in the second and third quarters over the first quarter in each year
as the Company’s annual payroll merit increases take effect. Selling and administrative expenses will vary in the fourth quarter in relation to performance in the quarter and for the year. In the second quarter of 2011, the Company recorded $2
million of tax benefit related to the reversal of reserves for interest related to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded $2 million of tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition
tax exposure. In the third quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a net $8 million tax benefit in the income tax provision related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom (See Note 8).
