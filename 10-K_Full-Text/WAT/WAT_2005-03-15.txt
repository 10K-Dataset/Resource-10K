INDEX



PART I

Item 1:

Business

General

Waters Corporation, (“Waters” or the
“Company”) an analytical instrument manufacturer,
designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters
Division, high performance liquid chromatography
(“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography
(“UPLC”) together with HPLC, herein referred to as
(“LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”)
instrument systems and associated service and support products,
including chromatography columns and other consumable products.
Additionally, and as a result of the acquisitions by Waters
Division of Creon Lab Control AG (“Creon”) in
July 2003 and NuGenesis Technologies Corporation
(“NuGenesis”) in February 2004, the Company entered
the laboratory informatics market (“Laboratory
Informatics”), which consists of laboratory-to-enterprise
scale software systems for managing and storing scientific
information collected from a wide variety of instrument test
methods. Through its TA Instruments Division
(“TA”), the Company designs, manufactures, sells and
services thermal analysis and rheometry instruments which are
used in predicting the suitability of polymers and viscous
liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and health care
products. The Company is also a developer of and supplier of
software based products which interface with the Company’s
instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of
the instrument system.

The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, life
science, biochemical, industrial, academic and government
customers working in research and development, quality assurance
and other laboratory applications. The Company’s
LC instruments are utilized in this broad range of
industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the
chemical, physical and biological composition of materials as
well as to purify a full range of compounds. MS instruments are
used in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial
testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as
“proteomics”), food safety analyses and environmental
testing. The Company’s thermal analysis and rheometry
instruments are used in predicting the suitability of fine
chemicals and polymers for uses in various industrial, consumer
goods and health care products.

Waters is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding
common stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating
subsidiary. The Company previously operated as the Waters
Chromatography division of Millipore Corporation, prior to a
management buyout of the division that became effective on
August 18, 1994. Waters became a publicly traded company
with its initial public offering (“IPO”) in November
1995. Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and
complementary technologies to its range of products with the
acquisitions of Micromass Limited (“Micromass”) in
September 1997 and TA in May 1996.

Business Segments

The Company evaluated its business activities that are regularly
reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer for which discrete
financial information is available. As a result of this
evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating
segments: Waters Division and TA Division.

As indicated above, the Company operates in the analytical
instruments industry, manufacturing, distributing and servicing
products in three complementary technologies:
LC instruments, columns and other consumables, MS, and
thermal analysis and rheometry instruments. Laboratory
Informatics consists of laboratory-to-enterprise scale software
systems for managing and storing scientific information
collected from a wide variety of LC and MS instrument test
methods and is an integral product line within the Waters
Division.

The Company’s two operating segments, Waters Division and
TA, have similar economic characteristics, product processes,
products and services, types and classes of customers, methods
of distribution, and regulatory environments. Because of these
similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one
reporting segment for financial statement purposes.



Waters Division

High Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid
Chromatography

Developed in the 1950’s, HPLC is the standard technique
used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a
variety of chemicals and other materials. HPLC’s
performance capabilities enable it to separate and identify 80%
of all known chemicals and materials. As a result, HPLC is used
to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for
research and development purposes, quality control and process
engineering applications.

The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served
by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these
markets, HPLC is used extensively to identify new drugs, to
develop manufacturing methods, and to assure the potency and
purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of
other applications such as the identification of food content
for nutritional labeling in the food and beverage industry, the
testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing
industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as
chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by
universities, research institutions and government agencies, and
in many instances, the United States Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”) and the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and their
international counterparts, mandate testing that requires HPLC
instrumentation.

A complete HPLC system consists of five basic components:
solvent delivery system, sample injector, separation column,
detector and data acquisition unit. The solvent delivery system
pumps the solvent through the HPLC system, while the sample
injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow. The
chromatography column then separates the sample into its
components for analysis by the detector, which measures the
presence and amount of the constituents. The data acquisition
unit, usually referred to as the instrument’s software or
data system, then records and stores the information from the
detector.

The primary “consumable products” for HPLC are
chromatography columns. These columns are packed with separation
media used in the HPLC testing process and are replaced at
regular intervals. The chromatography column contains one of
several types of packing, typically stationary phase particles
made from silica. As the sample flows through the column, it is
separated into its constituent components.

Waters columns can be used on Waters branded as well as
competitors’ HPLC systems. The Company believes that it is
one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica,
packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the
Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key
attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and
react quickly to new customer requirements.

During 2003 and 2004, the Company experienced growth in its HPLC
chromatography column and sample preparation businesses,
especially in the
Xterra

tm

and
Atlantis

tm

columns as well as in
Oasis

tm

sample preparation cartridges, all newly introduced in 2003. In
2004, the Company introduced a new column brand called
Sunfire

tm

.

Based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and
publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company
believes that it is the world’s largest manufacturer and
distributor of HPLC instruments, chromatography columns and
other consumables and related services. The Company also
believes that it has the leading HPLC market share in the United
States, Europe and non-Japan/ Asia and believes it has a leading
market share position in Japan.

Waters manufactures HPLC instruments that are offered in
configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation,
from
Breeze

tm

systems for academic research applications to fully automated
Alliance®2795 systems for high speed screening, and with a
variety of detection technologies, from UV absorbance to
MS, optimized for certain analyses. In 2003, the Company
introduced new application tailored HPLC systems for the
analysis of biologics as well as a new HPLC detector utilizing
evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of
HPLC to compounds that are not amenable to UV absorbance
detection.

In March 2004, Waters introduced a novel HPLC-type technology
that the Company described as Ultra-Performance Liquid
Chromatography which utilizes a packing material with narrow
diameter particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY
UPLC

tm

,
to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow



chromatographic bands that are generated by these small
particles. By using UPLC and the ACQUITY instrument, researchers
and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical
separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many
analyses performed by HPLC. In addition, in using UPLC,
researchers have the potential to extend the range of
application beyond that of HPLC, enabling the uncovering of new
levels of scientific information. Though UPLC and the ACQUITY
instrument are an extension of HPLC, the instrument is
compatible with the Company’s software products and the
general operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the
Company’s customers and field sales and support
organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology
and instrument. The Company began shipping the ACQUITY UPLC
system for demonstration and evaluation in the second quarter of
2004, with a normalized shipping plan, similar delivery
schedules as compared to HPLC products, beginning in the third
quarter of 2004.

The servicing and support of LC instruments and accessories
is an important source of revenue for the Waters Division. These
revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support
plans, demand service, customer training and performance
validation services. Support plans most typically involve
scheduled instrument maintenance, a commitment to supply
software and firmware upgrades and an agreement to promptly
repair a non-functioning instrument in return for a fee
described in a one or two year contract that is priced according
to the configuration of the instrument.

In the third quarter of 2003, Waters expanded its data
management product lines through the acquisition of Creon and
further enhanced its capability in this area through the
acquisition of NuGenesis in the first quarter of 2004. These new
Laboratory Informatics software products available for sale by
the Waters Division as a result of these acquisitions expand the
range of the Company’s information management offerings.
The Company’s existing server based software products,
Millenium® and
Empower

tm

,
are now augmented by the addition of Creon’s internet or
“web” based software that enables the reporting of
scientific data sourced from a broader array of instruments.

Broadly defined, Laboratory Informatics products are involved
with the safe keeping and organization of laboratory procedures
and experimental results. The products developed by Creon and
NuGenesis are software-based systems designed to accommodate the
general information archiving and retrieving needs of
laboratories involved in instrumental analyses, typically within
pharmaceutical, chemical and academic institutions. Customers
buying these products are often using them to replace
paper-based or internally developed (home grown) software-based
systems that lack the capacity, security and ease of use that is
either desired or required. The Company feels it has retained
the development resources from the acquired companies to ensure
continued leadership in this emerging market and plans to
continue selling and supporting its informatics customers
through the worldwide field-based resources of the Waters
Division augmented by a smaller group of specialists.

In 2004, the Company introduced a new informatics product, the
Electronic Laboratory Notebook, (“eLab
Notebook

tm

”),
designed to replace and augment the paper-based safekeeping and
archiving of laboratory procedures and results. In combination
with the Company’s Scientific Data Management System
(“SDMS”) product, eLab Notebook functions as a portal
to laboratory scale information storage and retrieval systems as
well as a flexible and personally manageable notation and
display device. The pricing of eLab Notebook is based upon the
number of users or seats that the customer decides to purchase.
The Company began shipping eLab Notebook in the fourth quarter
of 2004.

Mass Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is
used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials,
and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of
molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that
have been converted into ions.

The Company believes it is a market leader in the development,
manufacture, sale and distribution of MS instruments. These
instruments can be integrated and used along with other
complementary analytical instruments and systems such as HPLC,
UPLC, chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis
chromatography, gas chromatography and elemental analysis
systems. A wide variety of instrumental designs fall



within the overall category of MS instrumentation including
devices that incorporate quadrupole, ion trap, time of flight
(“Tof”) and classical magnetic sector technologies.
Furthermore, these technologies are often used in tandem to
maximize the efficacy of certain experiments.

Currently, the Company offers and provides service, support and
training for a wide range of MS instruments utilizing various
combinations of quadrupole, Tof and magnetic sector designs.
These instruments are used in drug discovery and development as
well as for environmental testing. The majority of mass
spectrometers sold by Waters are designed to utilize an HPLC or
UPLC system as the sample introduction device. These products
supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life
science, pharmaceutical, biomedical, clinical and environmental
markets worldwide. Service revenues are primarily related to the
sale of parts and to billed labor associated with instrument
repair and routine maintenance.

The mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection
device for HPLC and UPLC. The Company’s smaller sized mass
spectrometers (such as the single quadrupole
ZQ

tm

and Waters
EMD

tm

)
are often referred to as HPLC “detectors” and are
either sold as part of an HPLC system or as an HPLC upgrade.
Tandem quadrupole systems, such as the Waters Quattro
micro

tm

and Quattro Ultima® instruments, are used primarily for
experiments performed for late stage drug development, including
clinical trial testing, and Q-Tof Instruments such as the
Company’s Q-Tof
micro

tm

and Q-Tof Ultima® instruments, are typically used to
analyze the role of proteins in disease processes, an
application sometimes referred to as “proteomics”.

In 2003, the Company introduced two new mass spectrometry
systems, the Quattro
Premier

tm

and the LCT
Premier

tm

.
The Quattro Premier is a tandem quadrupole instrument that is
designed to deliver a higher level of speed, sensitivity and
reliability in a more compact configuration. The LCT Premier is
a LC, electrospray-Tof instrument designed to deliver a higher
level of mass accuracy and the ability for more precise
quantitative analysis.

In 2004, the Company introduced a new Q-Tof configuration mass
spectrometry system, the Q-Tof
Premier

tm

to replace its Q-Tof Ultima line of systems and offer a new
level of instrument performance to its customers. The Q-Tof
Premier is a tandem mass spectrometry system developed to
provide increased levels of sensitivity and specificity to
customers involved in challenging analyses such as those often
encountered in proteomics and metabolite profiling experiments.
The Company began shipping the Q-Tof Premier in the fourth
quarter of 2004. The Q-Tof Premier is compatible and often
purchased with an HPLC or UPLC system as an inlet, a device to
efficiently introduce a separated sample into the mass
spectrometer.

LC-MS

Liquid chromatography (HPLC and UPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS)
are instrumental technologies often embodied within an
analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of
analyses or as a general purpose analytical device. An
increasing percentage of the Company’s customers are
purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it is
becoming common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within
the same laboratory and be operated by the same user. The
descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical
segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical
categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly
in today’s instrument market, this segmentation and
categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of
instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS
technologies as part of a single device. In response to this
development and to further promote the high utilization of these
hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters
Division to develop, manufacture, sell and support integrated
LC-MS systems.

TA Division

Thermal Analysis

Thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of
materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature
affect several characteristics of materials such as their
physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical
properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal
analysis techniques. Consequently, thermal analysis techniques
are widely used in the development, production and characteriza-



tion of materials in various industries such as plastics,
chemicals, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and electronics.

Rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in
characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow
properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity
and deformation under different types of “loading” or
conditions. The information obtained under such conditions
provides insight to a material’s behavior during
manufacturing, transport, usage and storage.

Thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are heavily used in
material testing laboratories and in many cases provide
information useful in predicting the suitability of polymers and
viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
health care products. As with HPLC, a range of instrumentation
is available with increasing levels of sample handling and
information processing automation. In addition, systems and
accompanying software packages can be tailored for specific
applications. For example, the
Q-Series

tm

family of differential scanning calorimeters includes a range of
instruments from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive
systems that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a
variety of sample cells and temperature control features for
analyzing a broad range of materials. In 2002, TA introduced a
new dynamic mechanical analyzer (“DMA”), the
Q800

tm

DMA. In 2003, TA introduced two new DMA’s, the
Q400

tm

DMA and the
Q600

tm

DMA. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2003, TA expanded its
rheometry product line through the acquisition of Rheometrics
Scientific, Inc. (“Rheometrics”). During 2003, the
Rheometrics product line was successfully integrated within the
TA Instruments Division.

The Company sells, supports and services these product offerings
through TA, headquartered in New Castle, Delaware. The TA
division operates independently from the Waters Division though
several of its overseas offices are situated in Waters
facilities. TA has dedicated field sales and service operations
and service revenue primarily derived from the sale of
replacement parts and from billed labor expenses associated with
the repair, maintenance and upgrade of installed systems.

Customers

The Company has a broad and diversified customer base that
includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts,
universities and government agencies. The pharmaceutical segment
represents the Company’s largest sector and includes
multinational pharmaceutical companies, generic drug
manufacturers and biotechnology companies. The Company’s
other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers,
polymer manufacturers, food and beverage companies and
environmental testing laboratories. The Company also sells to
various universities and government agencies worldwide. The
Company’s technical support staff works closely with its
customers in developing and implementing applications that meet
their full range of analytical requirements.

The Company does not rely on any single customer or one group of
customers for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal
years 2004 and 2003, no single customer accounted for more than
3% of the Company’s net sales.

Sales and Service

The Company has one of the largest sales and service
organizations in the industry focused exclusively on LC, MS and
thermal analysis markets. Across these technologies, using
respective specialized sales and service forces, the Company
serves its customer base with approximately 1,990 field
representatives in 89 sales offices throughout the world as
of December 31, 2004 compared to approximately
1,890 field representatives in 97 sales offices as of
December 31, 2003. The sales representatives have direct
responsibility for account relationships, while service
representatives work in the field to install instruments and
minimize instrument downtime for customers. Technical support
representatives work directly with customers, helping them to
develop applications and procedures. The Company provides
customers with comprehensive product literature and also makes
consumable products available through a dedicated catalog.



Manufacturing

The Company provides high quality LC products by controlling
each stage of production of its instruments and columns. The
Company assembles most of its LC instruments at its
facility in Milford, Massachusetts, where it performs machining,
wiring, assembly and testing. The Milford facility employs
manufacturing techniques that are expected to meet the strict
ISO 9002 quality manufacturing standards and FDA mandated
Good Manufacturing Practices. The Company outsources
manufacturing of certain electronic components such as
computers, monitors and circuit boards to outside vendors that
can meet the Company’s quality requirements.

The Company manufactures its LC columns at its facilities in
Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland, where it processes,
sizes and treats silica and polymer media that are packed into
columns, solid phase extraction cartridges and bulk shipping
containers. The Wexford facility also manufactures and
distributes certain data, instruments and software components
for the Company’s LC, MS and thermal analysis product
lines. These facilities meet the same ISO and FDA standards met
by the Milford, Massachusetts facility and are approved by the
FDA.

The Company manufactures most of its MS products at its
facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire, England and
Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the
Company’s MS instruments are manufactured by long-standing
outside contractors. Each stage of this supply chain is closely
monitored by the Company to maintain its high quality and
performance standards. The instruments, components or modules
are then returned to the Company’s facilities where its
engineers perform final assembly, calibrations to customer
specifications and quality control procedures. The
Company’s MS facilities meet similar ISO and FDA standards
met by the Milford, Massachusetts facility and are approved by
the FDA.

Thermal analysis products are manufactured at the Company’s
New Castle, Delaware facility and rheometry products are
manufactured at the Company’s New Castle, Delaware and
Crawley, England facilities. Similar to MS, certain elements of
TA’s products are manufactured by outside contractors and
are then returned to the Company’s facilities for final
assembly, calibration and quality control. The Company’s
thermal analysis facilities meet similar ISO standards met by
the Milford, Massachusetts facility.

Research and Development

The Company maintains an active research and development program
focused on the development and commercialization of products
which both complement and update the existing product offering.
The Company’s research and development expenditures for
2004, 2003 and 2002 were $65.2 million, $59.2 million
and $51.9 million, respectively. Nearly all of the current
LC products of the Company have been developed at the
Company’s main research and development center located in
Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the
Company’s extensive field organizations. The majority of
the MS products have been developed at facilities in England and
nearly all of the current thermal analysis products have been
developed at the Company’s research and development center
in New Castle, Delaware. At December 31, 2004, there were
approximately 525 employees involved in the Company’s
research and development efforts. The Company has increased
research and development expenses relating to acquisitions and
the Company’s continued commitment to invest significantly
in new product development and existing product enhancements.
Despite the Company’s active research and development
programs, there can be no assurances that the Company’s
product development and commercialization efforts will be
successful or that the products developed by the Company will be
accepted by the marketplace.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 4,200 employees, with 49%
located in the United States, and 3,900 employees, with 48%
located in the United States at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The increase of 8% over 2003 is primarily due to
the acquisition of NuGenesis and increases in service personnel
in support of the Company’s growing installed base of
instrument systems. The Company considers its employee
relations, in general, to be good, and the Company’s
employees are not represented by any unions. The Company
believes that its future success depends, in a large part, upon
its continued ability to attract and



retain highly skilled employees. During 2004, the Company
announced and commenced a small restructuring effort to realign
its personnel between various support functions and field sales
and service organizations around the world. The employment of
approximately 70 people was terminated as a result of this
restructuring, all of whom had left the Company as of
December 31, 2004.

Competition

The analytical instrument and systems market is highly
competitive. The Company encounters competition from several
worldwide instrument manufacturers in both domestic and foreign
markets for each of its three technologies. The Company competes
in its markets primarily on the basis of instrument performance,
reliability and service and, to a lesser extent, price. Some
competitors have instrument businesses that are more diversified
than the Company’s business, but are typically less focused
on the Company’s chosen markets. Some competitors have
greater financial and other resources than the Company.

In the markets served by HPLC, UPLC, MS and LC-MS, the
Company’s principal competitors include: Applied
BioSystems, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., Thermo Electron
Corporation, Varian, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation and Bruker
BioSciences Corporation. In the markets served by TA, the
Company’s principal competitors include: PerkinElmer Inc.,
Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, HAAKE
and Parr-Physica. The Company is not aware of a competitor
offering a UPLC system comparable to its ACQUITY instrument.

The market for consumable HPLC products, including separation
columns, is also highly competitive but is more fragmented than
the analytical instruments market. The Company encounters
competition in the consumable columns market from chemical
companies that produce column chemicals and small specialized
companies that pack and distribute columns. The Company believes
that it is one of the few suppliers that process silica, packs
columns, and distributes its own product. The Company competes
in this market on the basis of reproducibility, reputation and
performance, and, to a lesser extent, price. The Company’s
principal competitors for consumable products include
Phenomenex, Supelco Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., Alltech
International Holdings, Inc. and Merck and Co., Inc. The ACQUITY
instrument is designed to offer a predictable level of
performance when used with UPLC columns to effect the chemical
separation. UPLC columns are both fluidically and electronically
connected to the ACQUITY instrument to allow users to
simultaneously employ and track the performance status of the
UPLC column. The Company believes that the expansion of UPLC
technology will enhance its chromatographic column business
because of the high level of synergy between UPLC and the
ACQUITY UPLC instrument.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

The Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents
and has patent applications pending in the United States and
abroad. Certain technology and software is licensed from third
parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The
Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as
valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes
that no one patent or group of patents, or trademark or license
is, in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its
loss would materially affect the Company’s business as a
whole.

Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws,
regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or
operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as
discharges to air and water, as well as handling and disposal
practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose
liability for the costs of cleaning up, and certain damages
resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases
of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently
conducts its operations, and in the past has operated its
business, in substantial compliance with applicable
environmental laws. From time to time, operations of the Company
have resulted or may result in noncompliance with or liability
for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. In July 2003, the
Company entered into a settlement agreement (the
“Environmental Settlement Agreement”) with the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, acting by and through the
Attorney General and the



Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”), with
respect to alleged non-compliance with state environmental laws
at its Taunton, Massachusetts facility. Pursuant to the terms of
a final judgment entered in the Superior Court of the
Commonwealth on July 10, 2003, the Company paid a civil
penalty of $5.9 million. In addition, the Company agreed to
conduct a Supplemental Environmental Project in the amount of
$0.6 million, comprised of investments in capital
infrastructure, to study the effects of bio-filtration on
certain air emissions from the Taunton facility and for the
purchase of equipment in connection therewith. Pursuant to the
terms of the Environmental Settlement Agreement, the Company
also agreed to undertake a variety of actions to ensure that air
emissions from the facility do not exceed certain limits and
that the facility is brought into full compliance with all
applicable environmental regulations. The Company does not
currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its
operations, financial condition or competitive position as a
result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws.

(ii) general changes in the economy or marketplace
including currency fluctuations, in particular with regard to
the Euro, British pound and Japanese yen, (iii) changes in
the competitive marketplace, including obsolescence resulting
from the introduction of technically advanced new products and
pricing changes by the Company’s competitors, (iv) the
ability of the Company to generate increased sales and
profitability from new product introductions, (v) the
reduction in capital spending of pharmaceutical customers,
(vi) the loss of intellectual property rights in the
Company’s research and development efforts, as well as
additional risk factors set forth below. Actual results or
events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and
expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements,
whether because of these factors or for other reasons. The
Company does not assume any obligation to update any
forward-looking statements.

Risk Factors

Competition and the Analytical Instrument Market:

The analytical instrument market, and, in particular, the
portion related to the Company’s HPLC, UPLC, MS, LC-MS,
thermal analysis and rheometry product lines, is highly
competitive, and the Company encounters competition from several
international instrument manufacturers and other companies in
both



domestic and foreign markets. Some competitors have instrument
businesses that are more diversified than the Company’s
business, but are typically less focused on the Company’s
chosen markets. There can be no assurances that the
Company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and
less costly products than those of the Company, or that the
Company will be able to increase its sales and profitability
from new product introductions. There can be no assurances that
the Company’s sales and marketing forces will compete
successfully against its competitors in the future.

Additionally, the market may, from time to time, experience low
sales growth. Approximately 53% of the Company’s net sales
in 2004 were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries, which may be periodically subject to unfavorable
market conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable industry
conditions could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations.

Risk of Disruption:

The Company manufactures HPLC and UPLC instruments at its
facility in Milford, Massachusetts, separation columns at its
facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland, MS
products at its facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire,
England and Wexford, Ireland, thermal analysis products at its
facility in New Castle, Delaware and rheometry products at its
facilities in New Castle, Delaware and Crawley, England. Any
prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these
facilities, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or
damage to either facility or other reasons, could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations and financial condition.

Foreign Operations and Exchange Rates:

Approximately 64% of the Company’s 2004 net sales were
outside of the United States and were primarily denominated in
foreign currencies. As a result, a significant portion of the
Company’s sales and operations are subject to certain
risks, including adverse developments in the foreign political
and economic environment, tariffs and other trade barriers,
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and
potentially adverse tax consequences.

Additionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net
sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Significant increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative
to certain foreign currencies could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s results of operations.

Reliance on Key Management:

The operation of the Company requires managerial and operational
expertise. None of the key management employees has an
employment contract with the Company, and there can be no
assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company.
If, for any reason, such key personnel do not continue to be
active in management, the Company’s operations could be
adversely affected.

Protection of Intellectual Property:

The Company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights
and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as
material and patentable. However, there can be no assurances
that any patents held by the Company will not be challenged,
invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted
thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company.
Conversely, there could be successful claims against the Company
where its intellectual property does not cover competitor
products or is invalidated. The Company’s patents,
including those licensed from others, expire on various dates.
If the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property
rights, it could have an adverse and material effect on the
Company’s results of operations and financial conditions.

Reliance on Customer Demand:

The demand for the Company’s products is dependent upon the
size of the markets for its HPLC, UPLC, MS, thermal analysis and
rheometry products, the level of capital expenditures of the
Company’s customers, the rate of economic growth in the
Company’s major markets and competitive considerations.
There can be no assurances that the Company’s results of
operations will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of
the factors listed above.



Reliance on Suppliers:

Most of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by
the Company are available from a number of different suppliers;
however, a number of items are purchased from limited or single
sources of supply, and disruption of these sources could have a
temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results
of the Company. The Company believes alternative sources could
ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials, but a
prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components
could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition or results of operations and could result in damage to
its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely
affect the Company’s business.

Reliance on Outside Manufacturers:

Certain components or modules of the Company’s MS
instruments are manufactured by long-standing outside
contractors. Disruptions of service by these outside contractors
could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the
financial results of the Company. The Company believes that it
could obtain alternative sources for these components or
modules, but a prolonged inability to obtain these components or
modules could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations.

Item 2:

Legal Proceedings

Hewlett-Packard Company

The Company filed suit in the United States against
Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH (collectively,
“HP”), seeking a declaration that certain products
sold under the mark “Alliance” do not constitute an
infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or its foreign
subsidiaries (the “HP patents”). The action in the
United States was dismissed for lack of controversy. Actions
seeking revocation or nullification of foreign HP patents were
filed by the Company in Germany, France and England. A German
patent tribunal found the HP German patent to be valid. In
Germany, France and England, HP and its successor, Agilent
Technologies Deutschland GmbH, have brought an action alleging
that certain features of the Alliance pump may infringe the HP
patents. In England, the Court of Appeal has found the HP patent
valid and infringed. The Company’s petitions for leave to
appeal to the House of Lords were denied. A trial on damages was
scheduled for November 2004. In March 2004, Agilent Technologies
GmbH brought a new action against the Company alleging that
certain features of the Alliance pump continue to infringe the
HP patents. At a hearing held in the UK on June 8, 2004,
the UK court postponed the previously scheduled November 2004
damages trial until March 2005. Instead, the court scheduled the
trial in the new action for November 2004. In December 2004, the
UK court ruled in the new action that the Company did not
infringe the HP patents. HP has filed an appeal in that action
and the damages trial scheduled for March 2005 has been
postponed pending this appeal and rescheduled for November 2005.
In France, the Paris District Court has found the HP patent
valid and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company appealed
the French decision and on April 12, 2004, the French
appeals court affirmed the Paris District Court’s finding
of infringement. The Company has filed a further appeal in the
case. In the German case, a German court has found the patent
infringed. The Company appealed the German decision, and in
December 2004, the German appeals court reversed the trial court
and issued a finding of non-infringement in favor of the
Company. HP is seeking an appeal in that action. The Company
recorded provisions in the quarters ended June 30, 2002 and
April 3, 2004 for estimated damages, legal fees, and court
costs incurred with respect to this ongoing litigation. The
provision represents management’s best estimate of the
probable and reasonably estimable loss related to the litigation.



Other:

Cohesive Technologies, Inc. (“Cohesive”) has brought
three suits against the Company in the U.S. District Court of
Massachusetts. Cohesive alleges that several products of the
Company, which are part of a much larger product line, are an
infringement of two Cohesive U.S. Patents. The Company has
denied infringement of such patents and has asserted several
defenses. Two of the products alleged to be an infringement are
now obsolete and are no longer sold in the United States. During
the fourth quarter of 2001, a jury returned a verdict in one of
the suits finding the Company liable for infringement of one of
the two patents. The Company intends to continue to vigorously
defend its position. Judgment has not been entered on the
jury’s verdict and further proceedings may preclude such
entry. The Company believes it has meritorious positions and
should prevail either through judgment or on appeal, although
the outcome is not certain. The Company believes that any
outcome of the proceedings will not be material to the Company.

Viscotek Corporation (“Viscotek”) filed a civil action
against the Company in the Federal District Court for the
Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, alleging that one
option offered by the Company with a high temperature gel
permeation chromatography instrument is an infringement of two
of its patents. These patents are owned by E.I. DuPont de
Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) and claimed to be
exclusively licensed to Viscotek. DuPont is not a party to the
suit. On January 16, 2004, a jury returned a verdict
finding that the Company had not infringed Viscotek’s
patents. Judgment has been entered on the jury’s verdict in
favor of the Company. Viscotek has appealed the judgment. The
Company believes it should prevail on appeal and, in any event,
that any outcome of the proceedings will not be material to the
Company.

Item 7:

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Business and Financial Overview:

The Company’s business in 2004 continued to benefit from
stable pharmaceutical customer demand, improved industrial
chemical customer demand and the impact of new product
initiatives. Sales grew by 15% in 2004 and by 8% in 2003.
Excluding currency effects, sales grew by 11% in 2004 and were
flat in 2003. Geographically, business was strongest in the
U.S., Japan, and Asia, particularly India and China, while
trending positively in Europe during the second half of the
year. Growth in these geographies was across all of the
Company’s product lines and in particular mass spectrometry
(“MS”) products and ACQUITY
UPLC

™

systems,
which accelerated sales in the second-half of the year.

From a product line perspective and excluding the impact of
currency translation, the Waters Division liquid chromatography
products (“LC”) — including high performance
liquid chromatography (“HPLC”) and Ultra Performance
Liquid Chromatography (“UPLC”) — grew
approximately 9% in 2004 and benefited from shipment of the
ACQUITY systems, growth in LC service revenues of 13% and growth
in LC chemical products of 10%. In mass spectrometry, sales grew
approximately 6% in 2004, as initial shipments of the Q-T of
Premier

tm

augmented the full-year performance of tandem quadrupole
instrument sales. As a result of the acquisition of Creon Lab
Control AG (“Creon”) in July 2003 and NuGenesis
Technologies Corporation (“NuGenesis”) in February
2004, the Waters Division entered the laboratory informatics
market (“Laboratory Informatics”). Laboratory
Informatics products and service added approximately 2% to the
Company’s sales growth in 2004. The Thermal Analysis
Division (“TA”) sales grew approximately 11% in 2004,
benefiting from overall stronger industrial chemical customer
demand, recent new product introductions and from the expansion
of the business into overseas markets.

Operating income was $284.9 million and $219.2 million
in 2004 and 2003, respectively, an increase of
$65.7 million or 30% for the year. In 2004, operating
income included the benefit of a litigation judgment in the
amount of $17.1 million from Perkin-Elmer Corporation
offset by litigation provisions of $7.8 million and



a technology license asset impairment of $4.0 million. In
2003, operating income included expensed in-process research and
development of $6.0 million, a loss on sale of a business
of $5.0 million, restructuring charges of $0.9 million
and litigation provisions of $1.5 million. The remaining
increase in operating income of $47.0 million is primarily
a result of sales volume growth, reductions in manufacturing
costs, operating expense leverage, and the effects of currency
translations.

Operating cash flow increased to $259.4 million in 2004
compared to $157.0 million in 2003. The increase of
$102.4 million for the year is primarily attributable to
the increase in net income and a decrease in the change of
accrued litigation from $60.1 million in 2003 to
$16.1 million in 2004 primarily related to the Applera
patent litigation. In addition, the Company received
$17.1 million in 2004 related to the Perkin-Elmer
Corporation patent litigation judgment. Capital expenditures
related to property, plant, equipment, software capitalization
and other intangibles were $66.2 million in 2004 compared
to $34.6 million in 2003. During 2004, the Company
purchased a 250,000 square foot building adjacent to the
Company’s headquarters for $18.1 million. The Company
intends to use this building to consolidate certain functions
and facilities in Massachusetts in 2005 and spent an additional
$3.2 million in 2004 to prepare the building for its
intended use.

In June 2004, the Company effectively concluded its
$400.0 million stock buyback program previously announced
in May 2003. The Company repurchased approximately
11.8 million shares under this program. In October 2004,
the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
repurchase up to $500.0 million in outstanding common
shares over a two-year period. The Company believes that the
share repurchase program is beneficial to shareholders by
increasing earnings per share through reducing the outstanding
shares and has financial flexibility to fund these share
repurchases given current cash and debt levels. In 2004, the
Company repurchased a total of 5.5 million shares of its
common stock for $231.3 million, of which 1.2 million
shares were purchased under the October 2004 program for
$56.3 million. This follows a 2003 repurchase of a total
11.9 million shares of common stock for $324.6 million.

In December 2004, the Company terminated its existing credit
agreement early without penalty and entered into a new Credit
Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of
banks, many of which participated in the prior credit agreement.
The new Credit Agreement increases the Company’s borrowing
capacity from $375.0 million to $700.0 million and
provides for lower borrowing costs and less restrictive
covenants. The Company believes that this additional borrowing
capacity will provide the Company the flexibility to fund
working capital needs, potential acquisitions and stock
repurchases. The Company had outstanding borrowings at the end
of 2004 of $456.7 million, primarily relating to borrowings
in the U.S. under the Company’s new Credit Agreement.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2003

(The Company has included references to the Notes of the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8 below.)

Net Sales:

Net sales for 2004 were $1,104.5 million, an increase of
15% compared to $958.2 million for 2003. Excluding currency
effects, net sales grew 11% over 2003. Currency translation
effect increased sales growth in 2004 by 4% primarily due to the
strengthening of the Euro, British pound, Japanese Yen and
Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. In 2004, product sales
increased $83.7 million or 12% and service sales increased
$62.7 million or 27% over sales in 2003. The increase in
product sales, aside from the effects of foreign currency
translation, is primarily due to the continued strength of LC,
MS and TA sales growth, the mid-year launch of the ACQUITY UPLC
system and the impact of acquired businesses. The increase in
service sales, aside from the effects of foreign currency
translation, is primarily due to growth in the Company’s
instrument installed base and sales of service contracts,
including the effect of the Company’s recent acquisitions.

Waters Division Net Sales:

With respect to the Waters Division’s performance by
product line (excluding the effects of currency translation), LC
sales (Liquid Chromatography — including HPLC and UPLC
product lines) grew approxi-



mately 9%. The growth in LC instrument sales in 2004 was 7%.
This growth was due principally to the introduction of new
products, such as the ACQUITY UPLC instrument, and steady demand
for existing instruments. In 2004, the sales of LC consumables
(sample preparation devices) in the Company’s chemistry
operations grew 10% primarily as a result of continued strength
in demand related to pharmaceutical production and the
introduction of new chromatography columns, most notably the
Sunfire

tm

product line. LC service sales grew 13% over 2003 due to
increased sales of service plans to the Company’s growing
installed base of customers. For the LC business, service
revenue was approximately 28% of total LC revenue in 2004. The
growth of LC service revenue was geographically broad-based and
was driven by increased demand primarily from large
multi-national customers for service plans to maintain a higher
percentage of their installed base and newly purchased Waters
instruments. LC consumables account for approximately 19% of
overall LC sales.

MS sales grew approximately 6% in 2004 (excluding the effects of
currency translation). The increase in sales over 2003 is
primarily a result of strong growth of tandem quadrupole
instruments throughout the year and the positive impact of new
product shipments, especially the Q-Tof Premier, late in the
year. The growth in 2004 is also a result of weak 2003 MS
performance, during which MS sales declined 18% over the
prior year, due primarily to the effects of a patent litigation
loss sustained in 2002. During 2004, the Company re-entered all
instrument categories impacted by the patent litigation loss.
Service revenue for the MS product line accounted for
approximately 19% of total MS revenue in 2004 and 2003, and
grew approximately 12% in 2004 due to increased sales of service
plans to the Company’s growing installed base of customers.

The Laboratory Informatics product line was expanded in 2004
with the acquisition of NuGenesis in the first quarter. In 2003,
the Laboratory Informatics product and service offerings
consisted of those from Creon, a company that Waters acquired in
2003. In 2004, Laboratory Informatics sales added approximately
2% to sales growth. Revenues consisted of new product sales as
well as revenue associated with the servicing of the user base.

Geographically, Waters LC and MS sales in Asia had the highest
growth in 2004. Growth in Asia was highlighted by business
associated with growth of the pharmaceutical industry in India
and more broad-based growth in China. More regulations for food
and drinking water testing contributed to sales growth in Japan
and in Southeast Asia. In Asia and in Japan, the Company’s
growth rates in sales (excluding the effects of currency
translation) were 27% and 14%. respectively. Sales in the U.S.
grew 12% while Europe experienced a modest 1% increase in sales
due to slower sales volume in the first half of the year.

TA Instruments Division Net Sales:

Sales for thermal analysis instruments, rheometry instruments
and related service revenues grew 11% in 2004 (excluding the
effects of currency translation). The growth of this business
was influenced by strong sales growth of 16% outside of the
U.S., primarily from Europe and Asia, as a result of expanded
sales and marketing efforts in the regions. Sales in the U.S.
grew 5%. In 2004 and 2003, service revenue was approximately 26%
of overall revenue and grew approximately 10% in 2004 primarily
as a result of providing service to a larger installed base of
instruments.

Gross Profit:

Gross profit for 2004 was $649.7 million compared to
$560.4 million for 2003, an increase of $89.3 million
or 16% and is generally consistent with the increase in net
sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.8%
in 2004 from 58.5% in 2003. The increase in gross profit
percentage is a net result of favorable foreign currency
translation along with the continuing success of the
Company’s manufacturing cost reduction programs, offset by
costs associated with additional service resources added to the
Waters Division in support of the service product line growth.
Within MS, there was a decrease in gross profit as a percentage
of net sales as a result of a product mix shift away from the
higher margin Q-Tof product line.

Selling and Administrative Expenses:

Selling and administrative expenses for 2004 and 2003 were
$300.2 million and $264.3 million, respectively. As a
percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses
declined slightly to 27.2% for 2004 compared



to 27.6% for 2003. The $35.9 million, or 14%, increase in
total selling and administrative expenses for 2004 included an
increase of approximately $11.9 million as a result of
currency translation; an incremental $10.4 million
attributed to the Laboratory Informatics acquisition; an
increase of $18.6 million in personnel costs attributed to
higher headcount, selling related expenses related to the higher
sales volume, annual merit increases and increased employee
incentive plans costs as a result of the Company’s 2004
performance. An increase in costs related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance of $3.2 million was offset by a decrease in
litigation costs of $3.8 million. The increase in selling
and administrative expenses was partially offset by
$6.6 million of realized and unrealized foreign currency
transaction gains compared to the $2.2 million of realized
and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in 2003.

Research and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses were $65.2 million for
2004 and $59.2 million for 2003, an increase of
$6.0 million or 10%. The increase is primarily attributable
to an increase in headcount due to Laboratory Informatics
acquisitions, the effects of foreign currency translation, and
to the Company’s continued commitment to invest
significantly in the development of new and improved LC, MS,
thermal analysis and rheometry products.

Purchased Intangibles Amortization:

Purchased intangibles amortization for 2004 was
$4.8 million compared to $4.2 million for 2003, an
increase of $0.6 million or 14%. The increase primarily
relates to the amortization of purchased intangibles resulting
from the Laboratory Informatics acquisitions.

Litigation Settlement and Provisions:

Net litigation settlements and provisions for 2004 were a
$9.3 million benefit compared to a litigation provision of
$1.5 million for 2003. The Company recorded the benefit of
a litigation judgment in the second quarter of 2004 in the
amount of $17.1 million and a provision expense of
$7.8 million in the first quarter of 2004. The benefit in
2004 is related to the conclusion of the Company’s
litigation with Perkin-Elmer. The provision in 2004 is related
to the on-going patent infringement suit with Hewlett-Packard.
In 2004, the Company made payments for legal fees and potential
award deposits regarding the Hewlett-Packard litigation in the
amount of approximately $4.1 million. The Company recorded
a $1.5 million expense in 2003 for an environmental matter
concerning the Company’s Taunton facility (Note 13).

Loss on Sale of Business:

The Company recorded a $5.0 million charge relating to the
loss on the sale (Note 8) of the inorganic MS product line
in 2003. There was no such charge in 2004.

Impairment of Long-Lived Asset:

In 2004, the Company recorded a $4.0 million charge for an
other-than-temporary impairment of its technology license with
Sandia National Laboratories, as a significant portion of the
technology collaboration program was suspended. The remaining
value of the license is approximately $1.0 million at
December 31, 2004. There was no such charge in 2003.

Restructuring and Other Unusual Charges, net:

2004 Restructuring:

In January 2004, the Company initiated a restructuring effort to
realign its personnel between various support functions and
field sales and service organizations around the world. As a
result, 70 employees were terminated, all of which had left the
Company as of December 31, 2004. The provision of
$2.1 million represents costs incurred, including severance
costs, for the 70 people and other directly related incremental
costs of this realignment effort.

2002 Restructuring:

In July 2002, the Company took action to restructure and combine
its field sales, service and distribution of its Micromass and
LC operations. The objective of this integration was to leverage
the strengths of both divisions and align and reduce operating
expenses. The integration efforts impacted the U.S., Canada,
continental Europe and the United Kingdom. Approximately
55 employees were terminated, all of which had left the
Company as of December 31, 2003. In addition, the Company
originally committed to closing four sales and distribution
facilities, two of which were closed by December 31, 2004.

The Company recorded $2.6 million of charges for the year
ended December 31, 2003 and $7.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, for restructuring and other
directly related incremental charges relating to its integration
of the worldwide LC and MS sales, service and support
organizations. The charge for the year ended December 31,
2003 includes severance costs for 13 people, distributor
termination costs and other directly related incremental costs
of this integration effort. The charge for the year ended
December 31, 2002 includes severance costs for 42 people,
contract cancellation fees, non-cancelable lease obligations and
other directly related incremental costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
reversed approximately $2.2 million in restructuring
reserves, primarily attributable to a change in plans with
respect to two facilities previously selected for closure and
distributor contract settlements being less than previously
estimated. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company reversed approximately $1.9 million in
restructuring reserves, primarily attributable to facility
closure and distributor termination costs being less than
previously estimated and the retention of certain employees
previously selected for termination.

The Company also recorded an unrelated restructuring provision
of $0.1 million at its TA subsidiary for severance and
other related costs in the year ended December 31, 2003.
There were no such charges for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2002.

Expensed In-Process Research and Development:

In 2003, in connection with the acquisition of Creon, the
Company wrote off the fair value of purchased in-process
research and development (“IPR&D”) of various
projects for the development of new products and technologies in
the amount of $6.0 million. The amount was determined by
identifying research projects for which technological
feasibility had not been established and which had no
alternative future uses. As of the Creon acquisition date (the
“Acquisition Date”), there were four projects that met
the above criteria. The



significant IPR&D projects identified consist of the eLab
Notebook and the automatic LC-MS dereplication system. The
IPR&D charges associated with these projects were
$4.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively.

Management determined the valuation of the IPR&D using a
number of factors, including engaging a third party valuation
firm to provide an independent appraisal. The value was based
primarily on the discounted cash flow method. This valuation
included consideration of (i) the stage of completion of
each of the projects, (ii) the technological feasibility of
each of the projects, (iii) whether the projects had an
alternative future use, and (iv) the estimated future
residual cash flows that could be generated from the various
projects and technologies over their respective projected
economic lives.

The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility
of these projects was whether the product met predetermined
design specifications and complex functionality. As of the
Acquisition Date, none of the IPR&D projects had reached
predetermined design specifications and complex functionality.
In assessing the technological feasibility of a project,
consideration was also given to the level of complexity in
future technological hurdles that each project had to overcome.

Future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of
the projects were determined based upon management’s
estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the
various products and technologies involved. These projected cash
flows were then discounted to their present values taking into
account management’s estimate of future expenses that would
be necessary to bring the projects to completion. The discount
rates include a rate of return, which accounts for the time
value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the
economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized.
The cash flows were discounted at discount rates ranging from
55% to 60% per annum, depending on the project’s stage of
completion and the type of complex functionality needed. This
discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects
included in the purchased IPR&D resulted in a total
valuation of $6.0 million. Although work on the projects
related to the IPR&D continued after the acquisition, the
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was written
off because the projects underlying the IPR&D that was being
developed were not considered technologically feasible as of the
Acquisition Date. As of December 31, 2004, the IPR&D
automatic LC-MS dereplication system project still had not
reached technological feasibility. The expected remaining cost
to complete this project is not considered material to the
Company and there are currently no expected material variations
between projected results from the projects versus those at the
time of the acquisition. The Company expects the project to be
completed within the next twelve months.

Other Income (Expense), Net:

In 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $1.0 million and
$0.3 million, respectively, of pre-tax charges for
other-than-temporary impairments to the carrying amounts of
certain equity investments (Note 5). The 2004 pre-tax
charge of $1.0 million is for the Company’s remaining
investment carrying value of GeneProt. This charge was recorded
based on the Company’s current assessment of
GeneProt’s financial condition.

Interest Expense:

Interest expense was $10.1 million and $2.4 million
for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2004 interest
expense is primarily attributed to the additional borrowings in
the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase programs (Note 10).

Interest Income:

Interest income for 2004 and 2003 was $11.9 million and
$7.1 million, respectively. The increase in interest income
is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher interest
rate yields.

Provision for Income Taxes:

The Company’s effective tax rate was 21.6% in 2004 and
23.6% in 2003. The change in effective tax rates for the period
was impacted by the net tax effect of the Perkin-Elmer
litigation judgment received and litigation provisions and
restructuring charges made during 2004, compared to the tax
effect of certain litigation provisions, restructuring charges,
expensed in-process research and development and loss on sale of
a business incurred during 2003. The effective tax rates,
excluding these items and corresponding tax effects, were 21.0%



and 23.0% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. This decrease is primarily attributable to the
increase in income in international jurisdictions with lower
effective tax rates.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2002

(The Company has included references to the Notes of the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8 below.)

Net Sales:

Net sales for 2003 were $958.2 million, an increase of 8%
compared to $890.0 million for 2002. Excluding the
favorable currency effects, net sales remained essentially flat
over 2002. In 2003, product sales increased $25.9 million
or 4% and service sales increased $42.4 million or 22% over
sales in 2002.

With respect to the Company’s performance by product line
(excluding the effects of currency translation), LC sales
overall grew approximately 5%. In 2003, LC chemistry grew 11%
primarily as a result of continued strength in sales related to
pharmaceutical production. LC service sales grew 14% over 2002
due to increased sales of service plans to our growing installed
base of customers. Growth in chemistry and service were offset
by a decline of 1% in instrument sales during 2003. The decline
in instrument sales is largely attributable to a combination of
postponements and delays in purchase decisions for such
instruments by the Company’s customers for new and
replacement products. For the LC business, service revenue was
approximately 27% of total LC revenue in 2003 compared to 25% of
revenue in 2002. The growth of service revenue was
geographically broad-based and was driven by increased demand
from large multi-national customers for service plans to
maintain a higher percentage of their installed base and newly
purchased Waters instruments. Chromatography consumables account
for approximately 19% of overall LC sales and grew by
approximately 11% in 2003. Chromatography consumable growth was
driven by increased utilization of existing LC equipment and by
the successful launch of a new line of chromatography columns
and sample preparation devices. Geographically, the strongest
growth areas of the world for LC in 2003 were Asia, Japan and
Eastern Europe, achieving 16%, 10% and 40% growth, respectively.
The U.S. grew modestly at 2%, while Europe experienced a decline
of 4%. Sales growth in Asian and Eastern European geographies is
related to economic modernization and development of basic
infrastructure. Japan continues to be a robust market as Waters
continues to offer Japanese language software products that meet
local needs. Markets in the U.S. and Europe languished in 2003
as we saw a continuation of delays in instrument replacements
early in the year at many of our pharmaceutical customers.

MS sales declined approximately 18% in 2003, excluding the
impact of the sale of the inorganic product line. The decline in
sales over 2002 was across most geographic areas, primarily due
to the impact of the Applera patent litigation, reduced MS
instrument prices and a decline in pharmaceutical capital
spending. Sales to customers working on proteomics applications
in the pharmaceutical industry, government and academic sector
and biotech all experienced declines in instrument purchases in
2003. The Company believes that its sales decline is a result of
a temporary market decline in 2003 as well as a loss of market
share to competing technologies that resulted in the overall 18%
sales decline in MS. Service revenue for the MS product line
accounted for approximately 19% of total MS revenue in 2003
compared to 12% in 2002, and grew approximately 27% during this
period. The growth in MS service revenue as a percentage of
overall MS revenue was primarily due to the decline in MS
instrument revenue, which is attributed to reduced demand from
proteomics customers.

Sales for thermal analysis products grew 20% in 2003, excluding
the impact of the acquired rheometry business. The growth of
this business is geographically broad-based with increased
spending by core industrial chemical and pharmaceutical
companies. The impact of sales in 2003 from the rheometry
business acquisition added an additional 16% to the thermal
analysis business growth. TA service revenue was approximately
26% of total TA revenue. Compared to 2002, TA service
revenue grew by approximately 41% primarily as a result of
providing service to a larger installed base of instruments and
the Rheometrics acquisition.



Gross Profit:

Gross profit for 2003 was $560.4 million compared to
$516.5 million for 2002, an increase of $43.9 million
or 8%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.5%
in 2003 from 58.0% in 2002. The increase in gross profit of 8%
is generally linear with the net sales increase of 8%, which is
mostly attributed to favorable foreign exchange in 2003.

Selling and Administrative Expenses:

Selling and administrative expenses for 2003 and 2002 were
$264.3 million and $246.8 million, respectively. As a
percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses
remained relatively flat at 27.6% for 2003 compared to 27.7% for
2002. The $17.4 million or 7% increase in total selling and
administrative expenses for 2003 included an increase of
approximately $17.7 million as a result of currency
translation, offset by a reduction in operating expenses of
$0.3 million. The reduction in operating expenses includes
cost savings of $4.5 million from the recently completed LC
and MS field sales and service integration efforts, generating
lower headcount and labor costs, associated fringe benefits and
travel costs. These reductions were offset by annual merit
increases across most divisions and other headcount additions
and related fringe benefits and indirect costs associated with
the 2003 acquisitions totaling approximately $4.2 million.
The Company experienced realized and unrealized foreign currency
transaction gains of approximately $2.2 million in 2003
compared to losses of $0.8 million in 2002, an increase of
$3.0 million.

Research and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses were $59.2 million for
2003 and $51.9 million for 2002, an increase of
$7.3 million or 14%. The increase is primarily attributable
to an increase in headcount due to acquisitions, specifically
Creon and Rheometrics, and to the Company’s continued
commitment to invest significantly in the development of new and
improved LC, MS, thermal analysis and rheometry products. In
addition, the Company incurred contract research and development
costs of $1.8 million related to new product development
efforts for the Q-Tof product line.

Purchased Intangibles Amortization:

Purchased intangibles amortization for 2003 was
$4.2 million compared to $3.6 million for 2002, an
increase of $0.6 million or 18%. The increase primarily
relates to amortization associated with the intangible assets
purchased as part of the Rheometrics and Creon acquisitions.

Litigation Provisions:

Litigation provision for 2003 was $1.5 million compared to
$7.9 million for 2002. The Company recorded
$1.5 million and $5.1 million in 2003 and 2002,
respectively, relating to an environmental matter concerning the
Company’s Taunton facility (Note 13). In 2002, the
Company recorded $2.8 million for the Applera patent
litigation for liabilities associated with product sales made
prior to the day of the unfavorable jury’s verdict in March
2002 (Note 12).

Loss on Sale of Business:

The Company recorded a $5.0 million charge relating to the
loss on the sale of the inorganic MS product line in 2003. There
was no such charge in 2002 (Note 8).

Impairment of Long-Lived Asset:

In 2002, the Company recorded a $2.4 million charge for an
other-than-temporary impairment of its technology license with
Variagenics, as the technology collaboration program was
discontinued (Note 5). There was no such charge in 2003.

Restructuring and Other Unusual Charges, net:

The Company recorded $2.6 million in 2003 and
$7.4 million in 2002 for restructuring and other directly
related incremental costs relating to its integration of the
worldwide LC and MS sales, service, manufacturing and support
organizations. The charge in 2003 includes severance costs for
13 people, distributor terminations and other directly related
incremental costs of this integration effort. The charge in 2002
includes severance



costs for 42 people, contract cancellation fees,
non-cancelable lease obligations and other directly related
incremental costs.

During 2003, the Company reversed approximately
$1.9 million in restructuring reserves, primarily
attributable to distribution and facility settlements being less
than previously estimated and the retention of certain employees
previously selected for employment termination. There were no
such reversals in 2002.

The Company has included in the consolidated balance sheet in
other long-term liabilities approximately $1.5 million and
$1.8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, for non-cancelable lease obligations with a
portion to be paid out extending to 2012. The remaining
$1.1 million and $3.7 million of the liability is
included in other current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The amount of expected annual cost savings is approximately
$6.0 million. The Company began realizing savings of
approximately $1.5 million per quarter beginning in the
second quarter of 2003. The Company believes that there were no
material increases in other expenses or reductions in revenues
as a result of this restructuring. The annual cost savings is
comprised of head count reductions of approximately
$4.2 million, reductions in related travel, promotional and
other expenses of approximately $1.6 million and facility
closures of approximately $0.2 million.

The Company also recorded an unrelated restructuring provision
of $0.1 million at its TA subsidiary for severance and
other related costs in 2003. There were no such charges in 2002.

Expensed In-Process Research and Development:

See Expensed In-Process Research and Development herein under
the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2003 discussion.

Other Income (Expense), Net:

In 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded $0.3 million and
$6.0 million, respectively, in pre-tax charges for
other-than-temporary impairments to the carrying amounts of
certain equity investments, including investments in GeneProt
and Variagenics (Note 5). During 2002, the Company recorded
a $1.0 million charge to other income (expense), in the
consolidated statements of operations, for an
other-than-temporary impairment of the equity investment and
warrants resulting from Variagenics public stock price declines.
In addition, in 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of
$12.6 million to other income (expense) for an
other-than-temporary impairment of its investment in GeneProt.
This charge was recorded because to the Company’s
knowledge, GeneProt had been unable to generate enough
commercial interest to expand its business in the U.S. market.
Additionally, during 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded a
$0.3 million and $0.1 million charge, respectively, to
other income (expense) for the impairment of certain other
equity investments. The impairment charges in 2002 were offset
by a $7.7 million termination fee received from GeneProt
for cancellation of its $20.0 million order. There were no
such off-setting charges in 2003.



Interest Expense:

Interest expense was $2.4 million and $2.5 million for
2003 and 2002, respectively. Total interest expense in 2003 was
offset by a $0.9 million reduction in an interest expense
estimate relating to the calculation of interest expense for the
Applera litigation paid in April 2003 (Note 12). Excluding
this reduction, interest expense for 2003 would have been
$3.3 million, or an increase of 32%. This increase
primarily relates to interest expense on borrowings against the
Company’s credit facility to fund the stock repurchase
program (Note 10). In 2002, the interest expense primarily
related to accrued post-judgment interest associated with the
Applera litigation.

Interest Income:

Interest income for 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and
$7.5 million, respectively. The decline in interest income
is primarily due to lower yields on cash investments.

Provision for Income Taxes:

The Company’s effective income tax rate was 23.6% in 2003
and 22.1% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate increased
primarily due to lower effective tax rates on special charges
and the expensed in-process research and development charge
related to the Creon acquisition of $6.0 million not being
tax deductible under German statutory law.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle:

In 2002, the method of accounting for patent related costs
associated with patent litigation was changed effective
January 1, 2002 from a method of capitalizing the patent
related costs and amortizing them over their estimated remaining
economic life to expensing the costs as incurred. The Company
believes that this change is preferable because it will provide
a better comparison with the Company’s industry peers, the
majority of which expense these costs as incurred. The
$4.5 million cumulative effect of the change on prior years
(after reduction for income taxes of $1.3 million) is
included as a charge to net income for 2002. There were no such
charges for 2003.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in
thousands):

Net cash provided from operating activities was
$259.4 million and $157.0 million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The primary sources of net cash provided from
operating activities were net income, the effect of depreciation
and amortization, and the increase in the tax benefit related to
stock option plans from stock



options exercised. Included in net income for 2004 was
$17.1 million in proceeds for the Perkin-Elmer litigation
judgment. Depreciation and amortization increased in 2004
primarily from the increase in capital spending, higher software
capitalization amortization and the effect of the Laboratory
Informatics acquisitions. Days-sales-outstanding
(“DSO”) increased by 5 days to 76 days in
2004 from 71 days in 2003. The increase in accounts
receivable and DSO are directly related to the timing of the
Company’s sales within the quarter, and foreign currency
translation. The increase in inventory at December 31, 2004
is related to the development of new products, primarily the
ACQUITY UPLC and the Q-Tof Premier.

The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities
are primarily related to the timing of payments of income tax,
compensation, and retirement accruals. Accrued litigation
decreased by $16.1 million primarily due to the
$18.1 million payment to Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex
Instruments for the settlement of a patent litigation matter and
approximately $4.1 million of payments in connection with
the Hewlett-Packard patent litigation matter, offset by a
$7.8 million provision for the Hewlett-Packard patent
litigation in 2004. The remaining change in accrued litigation
is attributed to payment of legal fees directly associated with
existing litigation accruals.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled
$108.6 million in 2004 compared to $18.7 million in
2003. Additions to fixed assets and intangible assets were
$66.2 million in 2004 and $34.6 million in 2003.
Included in 2004 was a 250,000 square foot building purchase
adjacent to the Company’s headquarters for
$18.1 million as well as approximately $3.2 million of
costs in construction in-progress related to improvements made
to the building. The Company intends to use this building to
consolidate certain functions and facilities in Massachusetts in
2005 and to accommodate growth over the next several years.
Aside from the purchase of this building, fixed asset and
intangible asset additions were consistent with capital spending
trends and expectations throughout the respective years.
Business acquisitions were $42.4 million and
$35.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, as the
Company continues to seek growth opportunities through
acquisitions. Included in 2003 was approximately
$49.9 million of cash provided by a decrease in restricted
cash. The Company held approximately $49.9 million of
restricted cash at December 31, 2002 in connection with the
standby letter of credit issued by the Company in 2002 for the
unfavorable judgment in the Applera patent litigation. Due to
the March 2003 affirmed judgment in the case, the Company paid
$53.7 million to Applera in April 2003. As a result of that
payment, the Company will no longer be required to maintain a
restricted cash balance.

Regarding cash provided by (used in) financing activities, the
Company repurchased 5.5 million and 11.9 million
common stock shares at a cost of $231.3 million and
$324.6 million, during 2004 and 2003, respectively. In
October 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million in
outstanding common shares over a two-year period. The Company
believes that the share repurchase program is beneficial to
shareholders by increasing earnings per share via reducing the
outstanding shares through open market purchases and that it has
adequate financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases
given current cash and debt levels. During 2004, the Company
purchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of
$56.3 million under the October 2004 Board of Directors
authorized repurchase program and 4.3 million shares at a
cost of approximately $175.0 million under a previously
authorized program under which the Company has purchased the
maximum amount of authorized shares. The Company believes it has
the resources to fund the common stock repurchases as well as to
pursue acquisition opportunities in the future. The Company
received $45.0 million and $27.8 million of proceeds
from other financing activities, including the exercise of stock
options and the purchase of shares pursuant to employee stock
purchase plans in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In December 2004, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement
(the “Credit Agreement”) to replace its existing
credit facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a
$250.0 million term loan facility, a $300.0 million
revolving facility (“US Tranche”), and a
$150.0 million revolving facility (“European
Tranche”). The term loan facility and the revolving
facilities both mature on December 15, 2009, and require no
scheduled prepayments before that date. At December 31,
2004, the Company had $250.0 million outstanding under the
term loan facility which is classified as long-term debt and
$190.0 million outstanding under the US Tranche revolving
facility. The Company terminated its existing credit agreement
early without penalty. The interest rates applicable to the term
loan and revolving loans under the new credit agreement are



equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime
rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1,
2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case plus an
interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage
ratio, which can range between 29.5 basis points and 80.0 basis
points. The Credit Agreement is unsecured in nature, and
requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio
test of not less than 3.5:1, and a leverage ratio test of not
more than 3:1, for any period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters, respectively. The minimum interest coverage ratio on
the terminated agreement was 5:1 and the maximum leverage ratio
test was 2.5:1. In addition, the new credit agreement includes
negative covenants that are customary for investment grade
credit facilities. The new credit agreement also contains
certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative
covenants and events of default. The new Credit Agreement
increased the Company’s committed syndicated borrowing
capacity from $375.0 million to $700.0 million and
provides for lower borrowing costs. The additional borrowing
capacity will provide the Company the flexibility to fund
working capital needs, potential acquisitions and stock
repurchases.

The Company believes that the cash and cash equivalent balance
of $539.1 million at the end of 2004 and expected cash flow
from operating activities together with borrowing capacity from
committed credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working
capital, capital spending requirements, authorized share
repurchase amounts and any adverse final determination of
ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months.
Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its
financial position along with expected future cash flows from
earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise
funds from a number of financing alternatives and external
sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating and
investing needs beyond the next twelve months.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(“AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA contains a
series of provisions, several of which are pertinent to the
Company. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for
U.S. multi-national corporations to repatriate accumulated
income abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction
for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. It
has been the Company’s practice to permanently reinvest all
foreign earnings into foreign operations and the Company
currently still plans to continue to reinvest foreign earnings
permanently into its foreign operations. The deduction is
subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to
how to interpret numerous provisions of the AJCA. As such, the
Company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to
what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not
yet been remitted to the U.S. Should the Company determine that
it plans to repatriate any foreign earnings, it will be required
to establish an income tax expense and related tax liability on
such earnings. If the Company elects this provision before it
expires at the end of 2005, the Company could repatriate a
maximum of $500.0 million in qualified foreign earnings. If
the maximum was repatriated, the Company estimates an increase
in the income tax provision of between $20.0 million and
$45.0 million depending on the final technical
clarifications.

Commitments:

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third
parties, which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid
for licenses were approximately $1.1 million in 2004,
$2.9 million in 2003 and $5.4 million in 2002. Future
minimum licenses payable under existing license agreements as of
December 31, 2004 are immaterial.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
individually or in the aggregate, with the exception of the
current litigation described in Note 12, Patent Litigation,
will not be material to the financial position or results of
operations.

During fiscal year 2005, the Company expects to contribute
approximately $7.5 million to the Company’s retirement
plans. Capital expenditures are expected to be modestly higher
in 2005, excluding the recent building purchase, due to expected
capital needs to support the growth in the business.

The Company is not aware of any undisclosed risks and
uncertainties, including but not limited to product technical
obsolescence, regulatory compliance, protection of intellectual
property rights, changes in pharmaceutical industry spending,
competitive advantages, current and pending litigation, and
changes in foreign exchanges rates, that are reasonably likely
to occur and could materially and negatively affect the
Company’s existing cash balance or its ability to borrow
funds from its credit facility. The Company also believes there
are no provisions in the new credit facility, its real estate
leases, and supplier and collaborative agreements that would
accelerate payments, require additional collateral or impair its
ability to continue to enter into critical transactions. The
Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any
dividends in the foreseeable future.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Summary:

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires
the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical
accounting policies are those that are central to the
presentation of the Company’s financial condition and
results of operations that require management to make estimates
about matters that are highly uncertain. On an on-going basis,
the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Revenue Recognition:

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
Partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or
performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the
consolidated balance sheets. Once the product is shipped, all
advance payments received associated with that particular order
are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the
customer invoice. Shipping and handling costs are included in
cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the
order. The Company’s products generally carry one year of
warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once
the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a
service contract. Service contract billings are generally
invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term,
and revenue is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
contract term. At December 31, 2004, the Company had
current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities of
approximately $66.8 million and $7.3 million,
respectively.

Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted
accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility
is not reasonably assured. The Company’s method of revenue
recognition for certain products requiring installation is in
accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104,
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.”
Accordingly, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the
fair value of the installation service is deferred



when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a
multiple element arrangement when installation is complete. The
Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a
number of factors, including hourly service billing rates,
estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged
by third parties. The Company believes that this amount
approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the
installation effort.

Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory:

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
to make required payments. If the financial condition of the
Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
allowances may be required. The Company does not request
collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced
through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit.
The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors
including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the
customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends
and the macro-economic environment. Sales returns and allowances
are estimates of future product returns related to current
period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount
and timing of revenue for any period if management made
different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales
returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company’s
accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004 was
$271.7 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and
sales returns of $7.1 million. Historically, the Company
has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
or market on a first-in, first-out basis (“FIFO”). The
Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on
technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future
demand including that in the Company’s current backlog of
orders, and industry and market conditions. If actual future
demand or market conditions are less favorable than those
projected by management, additional write-downs may be required.
The Company’s inventory balance at December 31, 2004
was $139.9 million, net of write-downs to net realizable
value of $14.1 million.

Valuation of Equity Investments:

The Company holds minority equity interests in companies having
operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus,
some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share
prices. For investments where a company is not publicly traded,
the Company obtains and reviews quarterly and annual financial
statements and progress of technological expectations. The
Company records an investment impairment charge when it believes
an investment has experienced a decline in value that is
other-than-temporary. Future adverse changes in market
conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments
could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying
value of the investments that may not be reflected in an
investment’s current carrying value, thereby possibly
requiring an impairment charge in the future. In 2004 and 2003,
the Company recorded $1.0 million and $0.3 million
charges to other expense, respectively, in the consolidated
statements of operations, for the impairment of certain equity
investments. At December 31, 2004, the Company had equity
investments totaling $17.9 million included in other assets
on the balance sheet.

Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill:

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles,
long-lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important
which could trigger an impairment review include but are not
limited to the following:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
    projected future operating results;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends; and

•

significant changes or developments in strategic technological
    collaborations or legal matters which affect the Company’s
    capitalized patent, trademark and intellectual properties such
    as licenses.

When the Company determines that the carrying value of
intangibles, long-lived assets and related goodwill may not be
recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above
indicators, it measures



any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method
using a discount rate determined by management to be
commensurate with the risk inherent in the Company’s
current business model. In 2004, the Company recorded a
$4.0 million charge for an other-than-temporary impairment
of its technology licenses with Sandia National Laboratories as
a significant portion of the technology collaboration program
was suspended. Net intangible assets, long-lived assets, and
goodwill amounted to $85.2 million, $135.9 million,
and $228.5 million, respectively, as of December 31,
2004. The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its
goodwill. The Company performed its annual review during 2004
and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in
the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that
at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment
charge will not be recorded.

Warranty:

Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its
component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is
affected by product failure rates, material usage and service
delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should
actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery
costs differ from the Company’s previous estimates,
revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
At December 31, 2004, the Company’s warranty liability
was $10.6 million.

Income Taxes:

As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial
statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes
in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process
involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure
together with assessing temporary differences resulting from
differing treatment of items, such as depreciation,
amortization, and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting
purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and
liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance
sheets. The Company must then assess the likelihood that its
deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income
and, to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely, the
Company must establish a valuation allowance. In the event that
actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company
adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need
to establish an additional valuation allowance which could
materially impact its financial position and results of
operations.

The Company has realized significant income tax benefits
associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options.
The corresponding credit was to additional paid-in-capital.
Because of the outstanding stock options, the Company believes
that it is more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax
assets will not be realized. Therefore, a valuation allowance
has reduced to zero all the deferred tax assets relating to U.S.
income. In the future event there is U.S. taxable income, the
valuation allowance would be reversed and deferred tax assets
recorded with a corresponding credit to additional
paid-in-capital.

Litigation:

As described in Item 3 of Part I of this
Form 10-K, the Company is a party to various pending
litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim,
management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether
a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss.
If and when management has determined, with respect to a
particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can
reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records
a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the
lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will
disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject
to considerable interpretation.

With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management
of the Company to date has been able to make this determination,
and thus has recorded charges, with respect to the claims
described under the heading “Hewlett-Packard Company.”
As developments occur in these matters and additional
information becomes available, management of the Company will
reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which
may result in its recording charges or additional charges, which
could materially impact the Company’s results of operation
or financial position.



Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits:

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
and the fair values of plan assets for the Company’s
pension plans and other post-retirement benefits are evaluated
periodically by management in consultation with outside
actuaries and investment advisors. Changes in assumptions are
based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as
the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are
evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.00%.

At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount
rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension
liabilities could be effectively settled. This rate should be in
line with rates for high quality fixed income investments
available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits,
and changes as long-term interest rates change. At year-end
2004, the Company determined this rate to be 5.75%.
Post-retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as
those used by the Company’s defined benefit pension plan in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits
other than Pensions.”

Recent Accounting Standards Changes

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payments”, which amends SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. This
standard requires that all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the
statement of operations based on their fair values. The standard
is effective for public companies for interim periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. The final standard allows alternative
methods for determining fair value. At the present time, the
Company has not determined which valuation method it will use;
however, under the Black-Scholes valuation model, it is
estimated that the pre-tax compensation expense recorded in the
consolidated statements of operations for the second half of
2005 would be approximately $14.5 million.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153
“Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets” which amends
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29. This standard
requires that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be measured based
on the fair value of the assets exchanged. This standard is
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and should be applied
prospectively. At the present time, the Company does not believe
that adoption of SFAS 153 will have a material effect on
its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151
“Inventory Costs” which amends Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 43 Chapter 4. This standard
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted materials
(spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges
and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to
inventory based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. This standard is effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
At the present time, the Company is evaluating SFAS 151 but
does not believe that it will have a material effect on its
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(“AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA contains a
series of provisions, several of which are pertinent to the
Company. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S.
multi-national corporations to repatriate accumulated income
abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for
certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. It has
been the Company’s practice to permanently reinvest all
foreign earnings into foreign operations and the Company
currently still plans to continue to reinvest foreign earnings
permanently into its foreign operations. The deduction is
subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to
how to interpret numerous provisions of the AJCA. As such, the
Company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to
what extent, the Company might repatriate foreign earnings that
have not yet been remitted to the U.S. Should the Company
determine that it plans to repatriate any foreign earnings, it
will be required to establish an income tax expense and related
tax liability on such earnings. If the Company elects this
provision before it expires at the end of 2005, the Company
could repatriate a maximum of $500.0 million in qualified
foreign earnings. If



the maximum was repatriated, the Company estimates an increase
in the income tax provision of between $20.0 million and
$45.0 million depending on the final technical
clarifications.

Item 7a:

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its
exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes
other than trading, in accordance with the Company’s
overall risk management guidelines. Further information
regarding the Company’s accounting policies for financial
instruments and disclosures of financial instruments can be
found in Notes 2 and 10 to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange-rate risk
with respect to certain inter-company balances, forecasted
transactions and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen
and British pound. The Company manages its foreign currency
exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to
analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting
exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes
derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to further
reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations.

The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and
cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
interest rates. The Company’s policy is to manage interest
costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that
management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix
in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered
into interest rate swaps, in which the Company agrees to
exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed
and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an
agreed upon notional amount.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a
floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount
of $125.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to
the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt, with a maturity
date of 21 months. The Company subsequently closed out the
swap in the second quarter of 2004, with a realized gain of
$1.6 million. The total pre-tax amount of the gain that was
re-classified to earnings in 2004 was $0.7 million. The
remaining $0.9 million will be re-classified to earnings in
2005 over the original term of the interest rate swap. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company had no outstanding cash flow
hedges.

Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
throughout the world, with approximately 31% of its sales
denominated in Euros, 11% in Yen and smaller sales exposures in
other currencies. As a result, the Company’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected
by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company
uses cross-currency interest rate swaps, forward contracts and
range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders’ equity
balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange
rates. These agreements are designated as foreign currency
hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. Any increase
or decrease in the fair value of cross-currency interest rate
swap agreements, forward contracts or range forward contracts is
offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of
the Company’s consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore,
these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an
effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the Company.

During 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in Yen
foreign affiliates with cross-currency interest rate swaps, with
notional values ranging from approximately $25.0 million to
approximately $37.0 million. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, the notional amounts of outstanding contracts were
approximately $37.0 million and $25.0 million,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
$2.4 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
which consisted of realized losses



of $1.6 million relating to closed cross-currency interest
rate swap agreements and unrealized losses of $0.8 million
relating to the Japanese Yen cross-currency interest rate swap
agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
$1.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
which consisted of realized gains of $1.3 million and
unrealized gains of $0.3 million. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company recorded cumulative net
pre-tax losses of $1.0 million in accumulated other
comprehensive income, which consisted of realized losses of
$1.4 million and unrealized gains of $0.4 million.

During 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in British
pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts
in British pounds. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax gain of
$0.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
which consisted of realized gains of $0.5 million related
to closed forward agreements and unrealized gains of
$0.2 million related to the British pound forward
agreements. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had
forward foreign exchange contracts in British pounds with a
notional amount of approximately 45.0 million British
pounds outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2003,
the Company recorded realized losses of $3.3 million in
accumulated other comprehensive income relating to forward
foreign exchange contracts in British pounds that were entered
into and closed in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company had no open forward foreign exchange contracts in
British pounds. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company recorded unrealized gains of $0.3 million in
accumulated other comprehensive income relating to forward
foreign exchange contracts in British pounds.

During 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in British
pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in
British pounds. Under the terms of the agreement the Company
purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell British
pounds, and sells an option to their counterparties above the
current spot rate to buy British pounds, with option premiums
that offset. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Company recorded a realized cumulative net pre-tax loss of
$8.6 million to accumulated other comprehensive income,
related to the closed range forward agreements. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company had no open range forward
agreements in British pounds.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end
exchange rates (a weakening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market
value of the cross-currency interest rate swap and foreign
exchange contracts agreements, designated as hedges of net
investment in foreign operations, as of December 31, 2004,
would decrease accumulated other comprehensive income by
approximately $12.3 million.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
certain inter-company balances. Principal hedged currencies
include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British pound. The periods of
these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be
consistent with changes in inter-company balances. Gains and
losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of
operations. At December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with
notional amounts totaling approximately $62.9 million and
$32.0 million, respectively.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end
exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair
market value of the forward contracts, designated as fair value
hedges, as of December 31, 2004 would decrease earnings by
approximately $6.3 million.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations
from the investments of cash generated from operations. The
Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less,
in repurchase agreements and money market funds. Cash
equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry
an insignificant risk of change in value. The Company
periodically maintains balances in various operating accounts in
excess of federally insured limits.



Item 8:

Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation:

We have completed an integrated audit of Waters
Corporation’s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of
its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
related consolidated statements of operations, of
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule at Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
patent related costs in 2002.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9a, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating



effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Description of Business, Organization and Basis of
    Presentation

Waters Corporation, (“Waters” or the
“Company”) an analytical instrument manufacturer,
designs, manufactures sells and services, through its Waters
Division, high performance liquid chromatography
(“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography
(“UPLC”) together with HPLC, herein referred to as
(“LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”)
instrument systems and associated service and support products
including chromatography columns and other
“consumable” products. These systems are complementary
products that can be integrated together and used along with
other analytical instruments. LC is a standard technique and is
utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify,
monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological
composition of materials, and to purify a full range of
compounds. MS instruments are used in drug discovery and
development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of
proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”)
and environmental testing. Liquid chromatography (LC or
UPLC) is often combined with MS to create LC-MS instruments that
include a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system
with mass spectrometric compound identification and
quantification. As a result of the acquisitions of Creon Lab
Control AG (“Creon”) in July 2003 and NuGenesis
Technologies Corporation in February 2004, Waters Division
entered the laboratory informatics market (“Laboratory
Informatics”). Laboratory Informatics consists of
laboratory-to-enterprise scale software systems for managing and
storing scientific information collected from a wide variety of
instrumental test methods. Through its TA Instruments
Division (“TA”), the Company designs, manufactures,
sells and services thermal analysis and rheometry instruments
which are used in predicting the suitability of polymers and
viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
health care products. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2003,
the Company completed the integration of the LC and MS worldwide
sales, service and support organizations. Accordingly, the
Micromass operating segment (“Micromass”) has been
integrated into the Waters operating segment. As discussed in
Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company has two operating segments, Waters Division and TA,
which have been aggregated into one reporting segment for
financial statement purposes.


Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, Waters evaluates
its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,
product returns and allowances, bad debts, inventory valuation,
equity investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income
taxes, warranty and installation provisions, pension
obligations, contingencies and litigation. Waters bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the
analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to,
development by its competitors of new technological innovations,
dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary
technology, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and
compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and
agencies.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified in the
accompanying financial statements in order to be consistent with
the current year’s classifications.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly
owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or
controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All
material inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated.

Translation of Foreign Currencies

For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date while revenues and
expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing
during the period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s net sales
derived from operations outside the United States were 64% in
2004, 63% in 2003 and 59% in 2002. Gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions are included in net income in the
consolidated statements of operations and were not material for
the years presented.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents primarily represent highly liquid investments,
with original maturities of 90 days or less, in repurchase
agreements and money market funds which are convertible to a
known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change
in value. The Company has periodically maintained balances in
various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits.

Restricted Cash

At December 31, 2002, restricted cash was
$49.9 million, which represented credit support for a
standby letter of credit issued securing damages awarded plus
interest with respect to the Applera patent litigation
(Note 12). In April 2003, the Company made a payment of
$53.7 million for damages and interest relating to this
patent litigation and, as a result, the Company is no longer
required to maintain a restricted cash balance.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products and services to a significant
number of large and small customers throughout the world, with
net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately 53% in
2004, 53% in 2003 and 54% in 2002. None of the Company’s
individual customers accounted for more than 3% of annual
Company sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The Company performs
continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
does not require collateral, but in certain circumstances may
require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company
has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the
existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on
historical write-off experience. The allowance for doubtful
accounts is reviewed on a monthly basis. Past due balances over
90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed
individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged
off against the allowance when the Company feels it is probable
the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have
any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventory

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
or market on a first-in, first-out basis (“FIFO”).

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences
between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and
liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is
provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon
the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense while the
costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation
is provided using the straight-line method over the following
estimated useful lives: buildings — thirty years,
building improvements — seven to thirty years,
leasehold improvements — the shorter of the economic
useful life or life of lease, and production and other equipment
- -two to ten years. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the
assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the balance sheet and related gains or losses
are reflected in the statement of operations. There were no
material gains or losses from retirement or sale of assets in
2004, 2003 and 2002.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests for goodwill impairment using a fair value
approach at the reporting unit level annually, or earlier if an
event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. Additionally, the Company has elected to make
January 1 the annual impairment assessment date for its
reporting units. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”, defines a reporting unit as an operating segment,
or one level below an operating segment, if discrete financial
information is prepared and reviewed by management. Goodwill is
allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition.
Under the impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying
amount exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill
exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value
of reporting units were estimated using a discounted cash flows
technique which includes certain management assumptions such as
estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and discount
rates.

The Company’s intangible assets include purchased
technology, capitalized software development costs, costs
associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and
intellectual properties, such as licenses, and debt issuance
costs. Purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market
values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their
estimated useful lives ranging from two to fifteen years. Other
intangibles are amortized over a period ranging from three to
thirteen years. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life
of the related debt.

Software Development Costs

The Company capitalizes software development costs for products
offered for sale in accordance with SFAS 86,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed”. Capitalized costs are
amortized to cost of sales over the period of economic benefit,
which approximates a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the related software products, generally three
to four years (Note 9).

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs in
accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”) 98-1,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use”. Capitalized internal software
development costs are amortized over the period of economic
benefit which



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximates a straight-line basis over ten years. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, capitalized internal software
included in property, plant and equipment totaled
$2.7 million and $1.7 million net of accumulated
amortization of $2.5 million and $2.1 million,
respectively.

Change in Accounting for Patent Related Costs

In the second quarter of 2002, the Company changed its method of
accounting for legal costs associated with litigating patents
effective January 1, 2002. Prior to the change, the Company
capitalized these patent costs and amortized them over the
estimated remaining economic life of the patent. Under the new
method, these costs are expensed as incurred. The Company
believes that this change is preferable because it will provide
a better comparison with the Company’s industry peers, the
majority of which expense these costs as incurred. The
$4.5 million cumulative effect of the change on prior years
(after reduction for income taxes of $1.3 million) is
included as a charge to net income as of January 1, 2002.
The effect of the change for the year ended December 31,
2002 was to decrease income before cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle approximately $2.8 million or $0.02
per diluted share and net income $7.3 million or $0.05 per
diluted share.

Investments

The Company accounts for its investments that represent less
than twenty percent ownership using SFAS 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities.” This standard requires that certain debt and
equity securities be adjusted to market value at the end of each
accounting period. Unrealized market gains and losses are
charged to earnings if the securities are traded for short-term
profit. Otherwise, these securities are considered
available-for-sale investments and unrealized gains and losses
are charged or credited to other comprehensive income
(loss) in stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and
losses on sales of investments are included in the consolidated
statements of operations.

Investments for which the Company does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence and for which there is not a
readily determinable market value are accounted for under the
cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates
the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the
cost method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost
or estimated net realizable value. For investments in which the
Company owns or controls between twenty and forty-nine percent
of the voting shares, or over which it exerts significant
influence over operating and financial policies, the equity
method of accounting is used. The Company’s share of net
income or losses of equity investments is included in the
consolidated statements of operations and was not material in
any period presented. All investments at December 31, 2004
and 2003 are included in other assets.

Asset Impairments

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
accordance with SFAS 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Whenever
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the fair
value of the asset, relying on a number of factors including but
not limited to operating results, business plans, economic
projections and anticipated future cash flows. Any change in the
carrying amount of an asset as a result of the Company’s
evaluation is separately identified in the consolidated
statements of operations.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and debt approximate cost.

Stockholders’ Equity

On August 9, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the
adoption of a stock purchase rights plan where a dividend of one
fractional preferred share purchase right (a “Right”)
was declared for each outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company. The dividend was paid on
August 27, 2002 to



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the stockholders of record on that date. The Rights, which
expire on August 27, 2012, become exercisable only under
certain conditions. When they first become exercisable, each
Right will entitle its holder to buy from Waters one
one-hundredth of a share of new Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (authorized limit of 4,000) for
$120.00. When a person or group actually has acquired 15% or
more of Waters’ common stock, the Rights will then become
exercisable for a number of shares of Waters’ common stock
with a market value of twice the exercise price ($120.00) of
each Right. In addition, the Rights will then become exercisable
for a number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company
with a market value of twice the exercise price per Right. The
Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at a price of $0.001
per Right up until 10 days following a public announcement
that any person or group has acquired 15% or more of the
Company’s common stock.

On June 25, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the
Company to repurchase up to $200.0 million of its
outstanding common shares over a one-year period. During the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company
purchased 4,399 shares of its common stock for
$100.6 million and 4,078 shares of its common stock for
$99.3 million, respectively. The total shares purchased
under this program were 8,477 thus completing its
$200.0 million stock buyback program.

On May 6, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $400.0 million
of its outstanding common shares over a two-year period. During
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company
purchased 4,270 shares of its common stock for
$175.0 million and 7,540 shares of its common stock for
$224.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2003,
the Company had borrowings outstanding under its credit facility
of $236.5 million principally to finance share repurchases.
The total shares purchased under this program were 11,810,
effectively completing its $400.0 million stock buyback
program.

On October 25, 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million
in outstanding common shares over a two-year period. During the
year ended December 31, 2004, the Company purchased
1,246 shares of its common stock for $56.3 million. At
December 31, 2004, the Company had borrowings outstanding
under its credit facility of $440.0 million principally to
finance share repurchases.

In the aggregate, the Company has repurchased 5,516 shares of
its common stock for $231.3 million during the year ended
December 31, 2004. The Company believes that the current
share repurchase program is beneficial to shareholders by
increasing earnings per share via reducing the outstanding
number of shares through open market purchases.

Hedge Transactions

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with
SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities”, as amended, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether
designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or
liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair value
hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized
in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow
hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of
the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income
(“OCI”) and are recognized in earnings when the hedged
item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair
value are recognized in earnings.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage
exposures to foreign currency risks. The Company’s
objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign
currency risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or
reduce the impact of foreign currency exposure. The Company
documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, and links all derivatives designated as fair
value, cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and
liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted
transactions. The Company also assesses and documents, both at
the hedges’ inception and on an



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
rates and interest rates.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a
floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount
of $125.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to
the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt, with a maturity
date of 21 months. The Company subsequently closed out the
swap in the second quarter of 2004, with a realized gain of
$1.6 million. The total pre-tax amount of the gain that was
re-classified to earnings in 2004 was $0.7 million. The
remaining $0.9 million will be re-classified to earnings in
2005 over the original term of the interest rate swap. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company had no outstanding cash flow
hedges.

Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
throughout the world, with approximately 31% of its sales
denominated in Euros, 11% in Yen and smaller sales exposures in
other currencies. As a result, the Company’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected
by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company
uses cross-currency interest rate swaps, forward contracts and
range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders’ equity
balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange
rates. These agreements are designated as foreign currency
hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. Any increase
or decrease in the fair value of cross-currency interest rate
swap agreements, forward contracts or range forward contracts is
offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of
the Company’s consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore,
these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an
effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the Company.

During 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in Yen
foreign affiliates with cross-currency interest rate swaps, with
notional values ranging from approximately $25.0 million to
approximately $37.0 million. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, the notional amounts of outstanding contracts were
approximately $37.0 million and $25.0 million,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
$2.4 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
which consisted of realized losses of $1.6 million relating
to closed cross-currency interest rate swap agreements and
unrealized losses of $0.8 million relating to the Japanese
Yen cross-currency interest rate swap agreements. For the year
ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded cumulative
net pre-tax gains of $1.6 million in accumulated other
comprehensive income, which consisted of realized gains of
$1.3 million and unrealized gains of $0.3 million. For
the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded
cumulative net pre-tax losses of $1.0 million in
accumulated other comprehensive income, which consisted of
realized losses of $1.4 million and unrealized gains of
$0.4 million.

During 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in British
pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts
in British pounds. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax gain of
$0.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
which consisted of realized gains of $0.5 million related
to closed forward agreements and unrealized gains of
$0.2 million related to the British pound forward
agreements. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had
forward foreign exchange contracts in British pounds with a
notional amount of approximately 45.0 million British
pounds outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2003,
the Company recorded realized losses of $3.3 million in
accumulated other comprehensive income relating to forward
foreign exchange contracts in British pounds that were entered
into and closed in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company had no open forward



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

foreign exchange contracts in British pounds. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company recorded unrealized gains of
$0.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive income
relating to forward foreign exchange contracts in British pounds.

During 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in British
pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in
British pounds. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell British
pounds, and sells an option to its counterparties above the
current spot rate to buy British pounds, with option premiums
that offset. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Company recorded a realized cumulative net pre-tax loss of
$8.6 million to accumulated other comprehensive income,
related to the closed range forward agreements. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company had no open range forward
agreements in British pounds.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
certain inter-company balances. Principal hedged currencies
include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British pound. The periods of
these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be
consistent with changes in inter-company balances. Gains and
losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of
operations. At December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with
notional amounts totaling approximately $62.9 million and
$32.0 million, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
specifying fixed terms and prices. Proceeds received in advance
of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as
deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Shipping
and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts
invoiced to the customer per the order.

The Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain
products requiring installation is in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.” Accordingly, the
larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the
installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and
revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when
installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value
of installation based on several factors, including hourly
service billing rates, estimated installation hours and
comparisons of amounts charged by third parties.

The Company recognizes product revenue when legal title has
transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company
generally structures its sales arrangements as FOB shipping
point or international equivalent and accordingly, recognizes
revenue upon shipment. In some cases, FOB destination based
shipping terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases
revenue is recognized when the products arrive at the customer
site.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and recorded as a
reduction to sales. Rights of return are generally not included
in sales arrangements. Revenue associated with products that
contain specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized
before the customer acceptance criteria is satisfied. Discounts
from list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales.

Nearly all of the Company’s instruments contain embedded
operating system and data management software, which is included
in the purchase price. Software is also sold separately and
revenue is recognized upon shipment under the provisions of SOP
97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as no
significant post-delivery obligations remain. Software upgrades
are typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue
recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company assists customers in obtaining financing with an
independent third-party leasing company with respect to certain
product sales. Revenue is generally recognized upon product
shipment under these arrangements. The Company receives payment
from the leasing company shortly after shipment, provided
delivery and credit documentation meets contractual criteria.
The customer is obligated to pay the leasing company but the
Company retains some credit risk if the customer is unable to
pay. Accordingly, the Company reduces revenue equal to
pre-established loss-pool criteria, including contracts with
recourse. The Company’s credit risk is significantly
reduced through loss-pool limitations and re-marketing rights in
the event of a default.

Product Warranty Costs

The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time
of sale which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated
statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive
product quality programs and processes, including actively
monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies,
the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product
failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs
incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the
accrued warranty liability is based on historical information
such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units
repaired and estimated cost of material and labor. The liability
is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

The following is a rollforward of the Company’s accrued
warranty liability for the year ended December 31, 2004

Advertising Costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in
selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations. Advertising expenses for 2004, 2003
and 2002 were $6.4 million, $7.5 million and
$8.3 million, respectively.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised of costs
incurred in performing research and development activities
including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead
costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and
development expenses are expensed as incurred.

Expensed In-Process Research and Developments Expenses

Costs to acquire in-process research and development
(“IPR&D”) projects and technologies, which have
not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition
and have no alternative future use, are expensed as incurred
(Note 7).

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has five stock-based compensation plans, which are
described in Note 16. The Company uses the intrinsic value
method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations, including
Interpretation 44, “Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation,” for its plans.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its
fixed employee stock option plans and its employee stock
purchase plan since all



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

stock based compensation awards are granted at the current fair
value of the Company’s common stock as of the date of the
award.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share had the Company applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” for the
Company’s five stock-based compensation plans.

The fair value of each option grant under SFAS 123 was

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment”, which requires the expensing of
unvested stock options. SFAS 123R is effective as of the
third fiscal quarter of 2005. Assuming SFAS 123R is adopted
as expected beginning July 1, 2005, pre-tax compensation
expense recognized in the 2005 financial statements is expected
to approximate $14.5 million (unaudited).

On December 31, 2004, the Company approved an amendment to
accelerate the vesting of approximately 238 thousand unvested
stock options granted between December 2000 and February 2001 to
certain employees of the Company. These options had an exercise
price significantly greater than the market value of the
Company’s stock at that time. Each stock option was
scheduled to vest primarily in 2005, but became fully vested and
exercisable on December 31, 2004. The exercise price and
number of shares underlying each affected stock option were
unchanged. The acceleration of these options was primarily done
as a result of the issuance of SFAS 123R which, under the
modified prospective method, requires the expensing of unvested
stock options in the first interim or annual reporting period
that begins after June 15, 2005. As a result of this
acceleration, the Company would not be required to recognize
share-based compensation, net of related tax effects, of
$4.1 million (unaudited) in the second half of 2005,
based on valuation calculations using the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Black-Scholes methodology. Total 2004 stock-based compensation
expense, net of related tax effects, is $39.4 million
including approximately $11.4 million of expense, net of
related tax effects, as a result of the acceleration of the
238 thousand unvested stock options on December 31,
2004.

Income Per Share

In accordance with SFAS 128, “Earnings Per
Share,” the Company presents two earnings per share
(“EPS”) amounts. Income per basic common share is
based on income available to common shareholders and the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
periods presented. Income per diluted common share includes
additional dilution from potential common stock, such as stock
issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding.

Comprehensive Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with
SFAS 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income.” The
statement establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of
general-purpose financial statements. The statement requires
that all components of comprehensive income be reported in a
financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence
as other financial statements.

Recent Accounting Standards Changes

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, which amends
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”. This standard requires that all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on
their fair values. The standard is effective for public
companies for interim periods beginning after June 15,
2005. The final standard allows alternative methods for
determining fair value. At the present time, the Company has not
yet determined which valuation method it will use; however,
under the Black-Scholes valuation model, it is estimated that
the pre-tax compensation expense recorded in the consolidated
statements of operations for the second half of 2005 would be
approximately $14.5 million (unaudited).

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153
“Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets” which amends
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29. This standard
requires that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be measured based
on the fair value of the assets exchanged. This standard is
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and should be applied
prospectively. At the present time, the Company does not believe
that adoption of SFAS 153 will have a material effect on
its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151
“Inventory Costs” which amends Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 43 Chapter 4. This standard
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted materials
(spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges
and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to
inventory based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. This standard is effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
At the present time, the Company is evaluating SFAS 151 but
does not believe that it will have a material effect on its
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(“AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA contains a
series of provisions, several of which are pertinent to the
Company. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for
U.S. multi-national corporations to repatriate accumulated
income abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction
for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. It
has been the Company’s practice to permanently reinvest all
foreign earnings into foreign operations and the Company
currently still plans to continue to reinvest foreign earnings
permanently into its foreign operations. The deduction is
subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to
how to interpret numerous provisions of the AJCA. As such, the
Company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to
what



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

extent, the Company might repatriate foreign earnings that have
not yet been remitted to the U.S. Should the Company determine
that it plans to repatriate any foreign earnings, it will be
required to establish an income tax expense and related tax
liability on such earnings. If the Company elects this provision
before it expires at the end of 2005, the Company could
repatriate a maximum of $500.0 million (unaudited) in
qualified foreign earnings. If the maximum was repatriated, the
Company estimates an increase in the income tax provision of
between $20.0 million (unaudited) and
$45.0 million (unaudited) depending on the final
technical clarifications.

Business Investments

In November 2000 and February 2002, the Company made minority
equity investments in
GeneProt

tm

,
Inc. (“GeneProt”), a privately held company, of
$3.6 million and $10.0 million, respectively. The
investment in GeneProt is accounted for under the cost method of
accounting. To the Company’s knowledge, due to changes in
GeneProt’s ability to generate enough commercial interest
to expand its business in the U.S. market, the Company recorded
pre-tax charges of $1.0 million and $12.6 million to
other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of
operations during the years ended December, 31, 2004 and 2002,
respectively, for an other-than-temporary impairment of its
investment in GeneProt. The investment in GeneProt is zero at
December 31, 2004 and approximately $1.0 million at
December 31, 2003, and is included in other assets. In
connection with GeneProt’s canceled order of up to
$20.0 million of mass spectrometry equipment, related
systems and services, the Company received approximately
$7.7 million from GeneProt as a cancellation fee, which is
recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated
statements of operations for the year ended December 31,
2002.

In June 2000, the Company formed a strategic alliance with
Variagenics, Inc. (“Variagenics”), a publicly traded
company, to develop and commercialize genetic variance reagent
kits for use in the clinical



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

development of pharmaceutical products. Variagenics was
considered a leader in applying genetic variance information to
the drug development process. In July 2000, the Company paid
Variagenics $7.5 million for a minority common stock equity
ownership and $3.0 million for a license to manufacture and
sell reagents. The investment in Variagenics is included in
other assets and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and
losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive
income (loss). During 2002, the Company recorded a
$1.0 million charge to other income (expense), in the
consolidated statements of operations, for an other than
temporary impairment of the equity investment and warrants
resulting from Variagenics public stock price declines. In the
fourth quarter of 2002, the license with Variagenics described
above was deemed fully impaired as the technology collaboration
program ceased, and the Company abandoned the technology and the
Company recorded a $2.4 million charge to impairment of
long-lived intangible asset in the consolidated statements of
operations. On January 31, 2003 Variagenics was merged with
Hyseq Pharmaceuticals and is now named Nuvelo, Inc.
(“Nuvelo”). The carrying amount, which approximates
market value, of the investment was approximately
$3.0 million and $3.2 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Other minority equity investments made during 2003 were
$1.8 million. Excluding the effects of currency, sales to
these entities during 2004 and 2003 were approximately
$0.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

During 2003, the Company recorded a $0.3 million charge to
other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of
operations for the impairment of certain other equity
investments.


Acquisitions

NuGenesis:

In February 2004, the Company acquired all of the capital stock
of NuGenesis Technologies Corporation (“NuGenesis”), a
company headquartered in Westborough, Massachusetts, for
approximately $42.9 million in cash. NuGenesis develops and
markets the NuGenesis Scientific Data Management System
(“SDMS”).

The acquisition of NuGenesis was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and the results of operations of
NuGenesis have been included in the consolidated results of the
Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the
acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and
assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The
Company has allocated $13.1 million of the purchase price
to intangible assets comprised of customer lists, trademarks and
other purchased intangibles. The excess purchase price of
$34.7 million after this allocation has been accounted for
as goodwill.

The Company considered a number of factors to determine the
purchase price allocation, including engaging a third party
valuation firm to independently appraise the fair value of
certain assets acquired. The



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

following table presents the fair values of assets and
liabilities recorded in connection with the NuGenesis
acquisition (in thousands):

In connection with the NuGenesis purchase price allocation,
deferred tax liabilities were established for the amortization
of intangible assets for book purposes that were not deductible
for tax purposes in the U.S. In the third quarter of 2004, the
Company transferred the NuGenesis intangible assets to a foreign
wholly-owned subsidiary, where the Company expects to deduct the
amortization of the intangible assets for book and tax purposes.
As a result, deferred tax liabilities and goodwill were reduced
by $4.6 million during the year ended December 31,
2004.

The Company recorded approximately $1.1 million in purchase
accounting liabilities relating to the NuGenesis acquisition.
Approximately $0.3 million has been utilized and
$0.7 million has been reversed as of December 31,
2004. The reversal was due to a change in management’s plan
to continue use of a facility lease assumed as part of the
acquisition until the end of its term in June 2005.

Creon:

Effective July 1, 2003, the Company acquired all of the
capital stock of Creon, a Company headquartered in Cologne,
Germany, for approximately $16.3 million in cash. Creon
specializes in Laboratory Information Management Software
(“LIMS”) solutions.

The acquisition of Creon was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting and the results of operations of Creon have
been included in the consolidated results of the Company from
the acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition was
allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed
liabilities based on their estimated fair values. In conjunction
with the acquisition, the Company recorded a charge of
$6.0 million for the write-off of acquired in-process
research and development. The technological feasibility of

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in-process research and development projects had not been
established at the date of acquisition and they had no
alternative future use. The Company has allocated
$4.4 million of the purchase price to intangible assets
comprised of customer lists and other purchased intangibles. The
excess purchase price of $5.6 million after this allocation
has been accounted for as goodwill.

The Company considered a number of factors to determine the
purchase price allocation, including engaging a third party
valuation firm to independently appraise the fair value of
certain assets acquired. The following table presents the fair
values of assets and liabilities recorded in connection with the
Creon acquisition (in thousands):

On January 15, 2003, the Company acquired the worldwide
rheometry business of Rheometrics for approximately
$16.5 million in cash. This transaction was accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting and the results of
operations of Rheometrics have been included in the consolidated
results of the Company from the acquisition date. This business
has been integrated into existing worldwide TA operations. The
purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to tangible and
intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their
estimated fair values. The Company has allocated
$5.5 million of the purchase price to intangible assets
comprised of customer lists, trademarks and other purchased
intangibles. The excess purchase price of $15.0 million
after this allocation has been accounted for as goodwill.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
acquired various tangible and intangible assets of certain Asian
distributors totaling approximately $1.4 million. In 2003,
the Company made similar acquisitions in Asia and Ireland
totaling approximately $5.4 million.

During 2002, the Company made business acquisitions totaling
$5.9 million. The business acquisitions were accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting and the results of
operations of the acquired companies have been included in the
consolidated results of the Company from the acquisition date.
The purchase prices of the acquisitions have been allocated to
tangible and intangible assets and any assumed liabilities based
on respective fair market values. Any excess purchase price
after this allocation has been accounted for as goodwill. With
respect to the 2002 acquisitions, the Company allocated
approximately $2.6 million of the purchase price to
customer contracts and non-compete covenants. Fixed assets and
intangible assets are being amortized over their expected useful
lives.

The following represents the pro forma results of the ongoing
operations for Waters, NuGenesis and Creon as though the
acquisitions of NuGenesis and Creon had occurred at the
beginning of each period shown (in thousands, except per share
data). The pro forma results exclude expensed in-process
research and development. The pro forma information, however, is
not necessarily indicative of the results that would have
resulted had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the
periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future
results.

The pro forma effects of the Rheometrics and other acquisitions
are immaterial.

7     Expensed In-Process Research
and Development

In connection with the acquisition of Creon, the Company wrote
off the fair value of purchased IPR&D of various projects
for the development of new products and technologies in the
amount of $6.0 million. The amount was determined by
identifying research projects for which technological
feasibility had not been established and had no alternative
future uses. As of the acquisition date, there were four
projects that met the above criteria. The significant IPR&D
projects identified consist of the eLab Notebook and the
automatic LC-MS dereplication system. The IPR&D charges
associated with these projects were $4.5 million and
$0.8 million, respectively.

Management determined the valuation of the IPR&D using a
number of factors, including engaging a third party valuation
firm to provide an independent appraisal. The value was based
primarily on the discounted cash flow method. This valuation
included consideration of (i) the stage of completion of
each of the projects, (ii) the technological feasibility of
each of the projects, (iii) whether the projects had an
alternative future use, and (iv) the estimated future
residual cash flows that could be generated from the various
projects and technologies over their respective projected
economic lives.

The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility
of these projects was whether the product has met predetermined
design specifications and complex functionality. As of the
acquisition date, the IPR&D projects had not reached
predetermined design specifications and complex functionality.
In assessing the technological feasibility of a project,
consideration was also given to the level of complexity in
future technological hurdles that each project had to overcome.

Future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of
the projects were determined based upon management’s
estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the
various products and technologies involved. These projected cash
flows were then discounted to their present values taking into
account



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

management’s estimate of future expenses that would be
necessary to bring the projects to completion. The discount
rates include a rate of return, which accounts for the time
value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the
economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized.
The cash flows were discounted at discount rates ranging from
55% to 60% per annum, depending on the project’s stage of
completion and the type of complex functionality needed. This
discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects
included in the purchased IPR&D resulted in a total
valuation of $6.0 million. Although work on the projects
related to the IPR&D continued after the acquisition, the
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was written
off because the projects underlying the IPR&D that was being
developed were not considered technologically feasible as of the
acquisition date. As of December 31, 2004, the IPR&D
automatic LC-MS dereplication system project still had not
reached technological feasibility. The expected remaining cost
to complete this project is not considered material to the
Company and there are currently no expected material variations
between projected results from the projects versus those at the
time of the acquisition. The Company expects the project to be
completed within the next twelve months.

8     Divestiture of Business

On March 26, 2003, the Company sold the net assets of its
mass spectrometry inorganic product line for approximately
$1.2 million in cash and the balance in notes receivable.
Assets sold included inventory and certain accounts receivable,
and liabilities assumed by the acquirer consisted of deferred
service revenue and advance payment obligations, and warranty
and installation obligations. The Company recorded a loss on
disposal of approximately $5.0 million, including severance
costs of approximately $0.3 million. This business
generated sales of approximately $14.0 million per year
with no significant effects to earnings per share results.

9     Goodwill and Other
Intangibles

The carrying amount of goodwill was $228.5 million and
$197.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The increase of $31.1 million is attributable
to the Company’s acquisitions (Note 6) during the
period of approximately $28.3 million, including certain
adjustments made in the third quarter of 2004, and currency
translation adjustments of approximately $2.8 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
acquired approximately $16.1 million of purchased
intangibles as a result of the NuGenesis acquisition
(Note 6) and other various customer lists and distributor
rights, mostly in Asia. In addition, foreign currency
translation increased intangible assets by approximately
$1.9 million in 2004.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
retired approximately $7.9 million in fully amortized
purchased intangibles and $2.8 million in fully amortized
capitalized software related to thermal analysis technology no
longer in use. During 2004, the Company recorded a
$4.0 million charge to operating income in the consolidated
statement of operations for the impairment of a license with
Sandia National Laboratories. There was no such charge in 2003.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
amortization expense for intangible assets was
$19.9 million, $11.9 million and $11.2 million,
respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is
estimated to be approximately $20.0 million for each of the
next five years. Accumulated amortization for intangible assets
increased approximately $0.2 million in 2004 due to the
effect of foreign currency translation.

10     Debt

In December 2004, the Company entered into a syndicated
committed Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”)
that provided for a $250.0 million term loan facility, a
$300.0 million revolving facility (“US Tranche”),
which includes both a letter of credit and a swingline
subfacility, and a $150.0 million revolving facility
(“European Tranche”). The Company may, on a single
occasion, request of the lender group that commitments for the
US Tranche or European Tranche be increased up to an additional
$100.0 million. Existing lenders are not obligated to
increase commitments, and the Company can seek to bring in
additional lenders. The term loan facility and the revolving
facilities both mature on December 15, 2009, and require no
scheduled prepayments before that date.

On December 15, 2004, the Company borrowed
$250.0 million under the term loan facility and
$195.0 million under the US Tranche revolving facility. The
Company used the proceeds of the term loan and the revolving
borrowing for the primary purpose of repaying outstanding
amounts under the Prior Credit Agreement (defined below). The
Company terminated such agreement early without penalty. The
terminated credit agreement consisted of a term loan tranche of
$125.0 million and a revolving tranche of
$250.0 million. The terminated credit agreement was
unsecured in nature.

The interest rates applicable to term loan and revolving loans
under the new credit agreement are, at the Company’s
option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of
the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the
applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each
case plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s
leverage ratio, which can range between 29.5 basis points and
80.0 basis points. The Credit Agreement requires that the
Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less
than 3.5:1, and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3:1, for
any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively.
The minimum interest coverage ratio on the Prior Credit
Agreement was 5:1 and the maximum leverage ratio test was 2.5:1.
In addition, the Credit Agreement includes negative covenants
that are customary for investment grade credit facilities and
are similar in nature to ones contained in the Prior Credit
Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary
representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events
of default, similar in nature to those in the terminated credit
agreement.

In February 2002, the Company entered into an agreement
(“Prior Credit Agreement”) that provided for a
$250.0 million line of credit, unsecured in nature and an
expiration date in February 2007. Loans under the Prior Credit
Agreement bore interest for each calendar quarter at an annual
rate equal to, at the Company’s option, 1) the
applicable LIBOR rate plus a varying margin between 0.60% and
1.50% or 2) prime rate.

In December 2003, the Company amended its existing
$250.0 million Prior Credit Agreement (“Amended Credit
Agreement”) dated February 2002 by closing on a
$125.0 million Add-On Term Loan Facility (“Term
Loan”). Proceeds from the Term Loan were used to repay
borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement, repurchase stock
and for general corporate purposes and was classified as
long-term debt at December 31, 2003. The applicable
interest changed from being based on the ratio of debt to total
capitalization to debt to EBITDA. Loans under the Amended Credit
Agreement bore interest for each quarter at a floating rate
equal to, at the Company’s option, 1) the applicable
LIBOR rate plus a varying margin between 0.60% and 1.50% or
2) prime rate.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had aggregate borrowings
under the Credit Agreement of $440.0 million and an amount
available to borrow of $256.8 million, after outstanding
letters of credit. At December 31, 2004, the
$250.0 million term loan was fully drawn and classified as
long-term debt. At December 31, 2003, the Company had
aggregate borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement of
$100.0 million and an amount available to borrow of
$147.7 million, after outstanding letters of credit.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company, and its foreign subsidiaries, also had available
short-term lines of credit, totaling $95.7 million at
December 31, 2004 and $96.0 million at
December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004 and 2003,
related short-term borrowings were $16.7 million at a
weighted average interest rate of 2.45% and $21.3 million
at a weighted average interest rate of 2.11%, respectively.


Income Taxes

Income tax data for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 follow in the tables below (in thousands):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The income tax benefits associated with nonqualified stock
option compensation expense recognized for tax purposes and
credited to additional paid-in capital were $32.0 million,
$17.6 million and $7.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
deferred tax benefit of net operating losses and credits is
broken out as follows: $73.0 million ($197.3 million
pre-tax) in U.S. operating loss carryforwards that begin to
expire in 2020; $48.4 million in foreign tax credits, which
begin to expire in 2009; $5.6 million in research and
development credits that begin to expire in 2009;
$1.6 million in alternative minimum income tax credits with
no expiration date; and $7.7 million ($26.7 million
pre-tax) in foreign net operating losses with expiration dates
ranging from 2005 to unlimited. The Company believes that it is
more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax benefit of
$154.9 million will not be realized, therefore, a valuation
allowance has reduced to zero all the deferred tax benefit
relating to U.S. income. In addition, the Company has provided a
full valuation allowance of $12.6 million against certain
foreign net operating losses and deferred interest. The deferred
tax liabilities relate primarily to the U.S. To the extent that
the deferred tax assets relate to stock option deductions, the
resultant benefits, if and when realized, will be credited to
stockholders’ equity.

Net deferred tax assets included in other current assets totaled
$4.1 million and $4.5 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Net deferred tax liabilities
included in other current liabilities totaled $10.4 million
and $9.3 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 21.6%, 23.6% and
22.1%, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate
benefited primarily from the preferential tax rate of 10%
afforded its Irish operations. The Irish rate will increase to
12.5% in 2011. The effect of the Irish operation is a benefit of
approximately $42.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share for
the year ended December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2004, there were unremitted earnings of
foreign subsidiaries of approximately $806.5 million. The
Company has not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign
withholding taxes on these earnings as it is the Company’s
current intention to permanently reinvest the earnings outside
the U.S.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(“AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA contains a
series of provisions, several of which are pertinent to the
Company. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S.
multi-national corporations to repatriate accumulated income
abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for
certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. It has
been the Company’s practice to permanently reinvest all
foreign earnings into foreign operations and the Company
currently still plans to continue to reinvest foreign earnings
permanently into its foreign operations. The deduction is
subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to
how to interpret numerous provisions of the AJCA. As such, the
Company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to
what extent, the Company might repatriate foreign earnings that
have not yet been remitted to the U.S. Should the Company
determine that it plans to repatriate any foreign earnings, it
will be required to establish an income tax expense and related
tax liability on such earnings. If the Company elects this
provision before it expires at the end of 2005, the Company
could repatriate a maximum of $500.0 million
(unaudited) in qualified foreign earnings. If the maximum
was repatriated, the Company estimates an increase in the income
tax provision of between $20.0 million (unaudited) and
$45.0 million (unaudited) depending on the final
technical clarifications.


Patent Litigation

Applera Corporation:

PE Corporation (since renamed Applera Corporation), MDS, Inc.
and Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex (“the Plaintiffs”)
filed a civil action against Micromass UK Limited and Micromass,
Inc., wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware (the
“Court”) on February 18, 2000. The Plaintiffs
alleged that the Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer infringes U.S. Patent No. 4,963,736 (“the
patent”). The patent is owned by MDS, Inc. and licensed to
a joint venture with Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex Instruments.

In March 2002, the Company was informed of a jury’s finding
that the Quattro Ultima with Mass Transit ion tunnel technology
infringes the patent. The same jury found that the infringement
was not willful and determined damages in the amount of
$47.5 million. The Court entered an injunction in which the
Company is enjoined from making, using and selling in the U.S.
the Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
incorporating features of the patent.

In March 2003, the Court’s decision was affirmed on appeal.
In April 2003, the Company paid total damages and interest of
approximately $53.7 million to the Plaintiffs. These
instruments are manufactured in the United Kingdom and shipments
to the rest of the world outside the United States were not
subject to this litigation. Similar claims were asserted against
the Company by the Plaintiffs in Japan and Canada. Also, in
2003, the Company reversed approximately $0.9 million of
interest as a one-time credit to interest expense.

Previously, in July 2002, the Company filed a civil action
against Applera Corporation alleging patent infringement of U.S.
Patent No. 5,304,798 owned by the Company. In November
2002, the University of Manitoba (the “University”)
and Applera Corporation, its licensee, filed a civil action
against the Company alleging patent infringement of U.S. Patent
No. 6,331,702 owned by the University.

On October 31, 2003, MDS, Inc. and Applied Biosystems/ MDS
Sciex Instruments filed a civil action against Micromass UK
Limited, Waters Limited, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the
Company, and the Company, in the High Court of Justice, Chancery
Division, Patents Courts, UK. The case alleged that certain of
the Company’s MS products infringe European Patent
(UK) No. 0 373 835 (the “European Patent”).
To the Company’s knowledge, the European Patent is owned by
MDS, Inc. and licensed to a joint venture with



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex Instruments. The Plaintiffs in
this action were seeking an injunction against the Company to
restrain it from infringing the European Patent and an
unspecified award of damages.

On March 2, 2004, the Company and MDS, Inc., through its
Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex Instruments partnership, and
Applied Biosystems entered into a settlement agreement (the
“Applera Settlement Agreement”) with respect to the
various civil actions pending against each of them, both in the
United States and internationally. Stipulations of Dismissal or
their foreign equivalents (the “Stipulations”) with
respect to the disposal of all such actions have been entered in
the applicable courts and tribunals in each of the United
States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.

The Applera Settlement Agreement provides for the resolution of
all patent infringement claims in the United States made by
certain of the parties against the other and of international
cases brought by MDS, Inc. and Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex
Instruments against the Company with respect to alleged
infringements of those parties’ patents at issue in the
United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.

In consideration of entering into the Applera Settlement
Agreement and the Stipulations, the Company and MDS, Inc. and
Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex Instruments have entered into
royalty paying license agreements, cross licensing the use of
the technology described in the parties’ respective patents
at issue. In addition, the Company made a one-time payment to
Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex Instruments of $18.1 million
on March 11, 2004.

The accrued patent litigation expenses in the consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003 were $0.1 million and
$19.9 million, respectively. The accrued expense at
December 31, 2004 represents the Company’s best
estimate of remaining legal expenses necessary to conclude this
litigation. The change in the liability from December 31,
2003 is attributed to the one-time payment of $18.1 million
and payments of legal fees directly associated with these cases.
There were no charges in the statements of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 related to these
cases.

Hewlett-Packard Company:

The Company filed suit in the United States against
Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH (collectively,
“HP”), seeking a declaration that certain products
sold under the mark “Alliance” do not constitute an
infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or its foreign
subsidiaries (the “HP patents”). The action in the
United States was dismissed for lack of controversy. Actions
seeking revocation or nullification of foreign HP patents were
filed by the Company in Germany, France and England. A German
patent tribunal found the HP German patent to be valid. In
Germany, France and England, HP and its successor, Agilent
Technologies Deutschland GmbH, have brought an action alleging
that certain features of the Alliance pump may infringe the HP
patents. In England, the Court of Appeal has found the HP patent
valid and infringed. The Company’s petitions for leave to
appeal to the House of Lords were denied. A trial on damages was
scheduled for November 2004. In March 2004, Agilent Technologies
GmbH brought a new action against the Company alleging that
certain features of the Alliance pump continue to infringe the
HP patents. At a hearing held in the UK on June 8, 2004,
the UK court postponed the previously scheduled November 2004
damages trial until March 2005. Instead, the court scheduled the
trial in the new action for November 2004. In December 2004, the
UK court ruled in the new action that the Company did not
infringe the HP patents. HP has filed an appeal in that action
and the damages trial scheduled for March 2005 has been
postponed pending this appeal and rescheduled for November 2005.
In France, the Paris District Court has found the HP patent
valid and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company appealed
the French decision and on April 12, 2004, the French
appeals court affirmed the Paris District Court’s finding
of infringement. The Company has filed a further appeal in the
case. In the German case, a German court has found the patent
infringed. The Company appealed the German decision, and in
December 2004, the German appeals court reversed the trial court
and issued a finding of non-infringement in favor of the
Company. HP is seeking an appeal in that action.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company recorded a provision of $7.8 million in the
first quarter of 2004 for estimated damages and fees to be
incurred with respect to the ongoing litigation for the England
and France suits, excluding the effect of the recent suit filed
in March 2004. This provision represents management’s best
estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable loss related
to this litigation. No provision has been made for the Germany
suit and the Company believes the outcome, if the plaintiff
ultimately prevails, will not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position. The accrued patent litigation
expense in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2004 was $4.5 million for the England and France suits. The
liability includes a provision of $0.8 million made in
2002. The change in the liability through December 31, 2004
is attributable to a payment of initial deposits of potential
damages of $3.2 million and payments of legal fees directly
associated with the cases.

Perkin-Elmer Corporation:

The Company, through its subsidiary TA, asserted a claim against
The Perkin-Elmer Corporation (“PE”) alleging patent
infringement of three patents owned by TA (the “TAI
patents”). PE counterclaimed for infringement of a patent
owned by PE (the “PE patent”). The U.S. District Court
for the District of Delaware granted judgment as a matter of law
in favor of TA and enjoined PE from infringing the TAI patents.
PE appealed the District Court judgment in favor of TA to the
federal appellate court. The District Court’s judgment,
with respect to PE’s infringement of the TAI patents, was
affirmed. The District Court’s judgment with respect to
TA’s non-infringement of the PE patent was reversed and
remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.

On remand to the District Court in October 2002, a jury found PE
liable to TA for damages of $13.3 million and found TA did
not infringe the PE patent. In May 2003, the District Court
entered judgment on the jury’s verdict in favor of the
Company. PE has appealed the judgment with respect to TA’s
non-infringement of the PE patent. A hearing on the matter was
held on May 4, 2004. On May 5, 2004, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment
of non-infringement of the PE Patent. On May 11, 2004, PE,
now known as Applera Corporation, paid the Company
$17.4 million, including $0.2 million in post-judgment
interest which has been classified as interest income in the
consolidated statements of operations. Approximately
$0.1 million in legal fees were incurred and were offset
against the recording of settlement proceeds.

13     Environmental Contingency

In July 2003, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
(the “Environmental Settlement Agreement”) with the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, acting by and through the
Attorney General and the Department of Environmental Protection,
with respect to alleged non-compliance with state environmental
laws at its Taunton, Massachusetts facility. Pursuant to the
terms of a final judgment entered in the Superior Court of the
Commonwealth on July 10, 2003, the Company paid a civil
penalty of $5.9 million. In addition, the Company agreed to
conduct a Supplemental Environmental Project in the amount of
$0.6 million, comprised of investments in capital
infrastructure, to study the effects of bio-filtration on
certain air emissions from the Taunton facility and for the
purchase of equipment in connection therewith. Pursuant to the
terms of the Environmental Settlement Agreement, the Company
also agreed to undertake a variety of actions to ensure that air
emissions from the facility do not exceed certain limits and
that the facility is brought into full compliance with all
applicable environmental regulations.

14     Restructuring and Other
Charges

2004 Restructuring:

In January 2004, the Company initiated a small restructuring
effort to realign its personnel between various support
functions and field sales and service organizations around the
world. As a result, 70 employees were to be terminated, all
of whom had left the Company as of December 31, 2004. The
provision of $2.1 million

2002 Restructuring:

In July 2002, the Company took action to restructure and combine
its field sales, service and distribution of its Micromass and
LC operations. The objective of this integration is to leverage
the strengths of both divisions and align and reduce operating
expenses. The integration efforts impacted the U.S., Canada,
continental Europe and the United Kingdom. Approximately 55
employees were terminated, of whom all had left the Company as
of December 31, 2004. In addition, the Company originally
committed to closing four sales and distribution facilities, two
of which were closed by December 31, 2004.

The Company recorded $2.6 million of charges for the year
ended December 31, 2003 and $7.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, for restructuring and other
directly related incremental charges relating to its integration
of the worldwide LC and MS sales, service and support
organizations. The charge for the year ended December 31,
2003 includes severance costs for 13 people, distributor
termination costs and other directly related incremental costs
of this integration effort. The charge for the year ended
December 31, 2002 includes severance costs for 42 people,
contract cancellation fees, non-cancelable lease obligations and
other directly related incremental costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
reversed approximately $2.2 million in restructuring
reserves, primarily attributable to a change in plans with
respect to two facilities previously selected for closure and
distributor contract settlements being less than previously
estimated. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company reversed approximately $1.9 million in
restructuring reserves, primarily attributable to facility
closure and distributor termination costs being less than
previously estimated and the retention of certain employees
previously selected for termination. There were no such
reversals in 2002.

Contingencies

Lease agreements, expiring at various dates through 2022, cover
buildings, office equipment and automobiles. Rental expense was
$19.7 million, $19.6 million and $13.9 million
during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Future minimum rents payable as of

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third
parties, which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid
for licenses were approximately $1.1 million,
$2.9 million and $5.4 million during the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Future
minimum licenses payable under existing license agreements as of
December 31, 2004 are $0.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005, and are immaterial for the years ended
December 31, 2006 and thereafter.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
individually or in the aggregate, with the exception of the
current litigation described in Note 12, will not be
material to the financial position or results of operations.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in
its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements,
the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse
the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
indemnified party, generally the Company’s business
partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or
other intellectual property infringement claims by any third
party with respect to its current products, as well as claims
relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from
the performance of services by the Company or its
subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments
the Company could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the
Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and
management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of
these agreements is immaterial.


Stock Option and Purchase Plans

Stock Option Plans

On May 7, 1996, the Company’s shareholders approved
the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“1996 Plan”), which
provides for the granting of 4,000 shares of Common Stock,
in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock or
other types of awards. Under the 1996 Plan, the exercise
price for stock options may not be less than the fair market
value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. On
May 7, 2002 and May 12, 1998, the Company’s
shareholders approved an additional 5,750 and 8,000 shares,
respectively, of Common Stock for issuance under the 1996 Plan.
The 1996 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 7, 2006,
unless extended for a period of up to five years by action of
the Board of Directors. Options generally will expire no later
than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will
become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors. A SAR may be granted alone or in
conjunction with an option or other award.

The Company’s 1994 Stock Option Plan (“1994
Plan”) provided for the granting of 20,141 options to
purchase shares of Common Stock to certain key employees of the
Company. The exercise price of the options was determined by a
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. Options
granted have a term of ten years and vest in five equal
installments on the first five anniversaries after the grant.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On May 7, 1996, the Company’s shareholders approved
the 1996 Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan
(“Deferred Compensation Plan”) and the 1996
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (“Director Stock
Option Plan”). Under the Deferred Compensation Plan,
outside directors may elect to defer their fees and credit such
fees to either a cash account which earns interest at a
market-based rate or to a common stock unit account, for which
four hundred thousand shares of Common Stock have been reserved.
Under the Director Stock Option Plan, each outside director will
receive an annual option to purchase four thousand shares of
Common Stock. Two hundred thousand shares of Common Stock may be
issued under the plan. Options have a term of ten years and,
with the exception of options granted in 1996, which vest in one
year, vest in five equal installments on the first five
anniversaries following the date of grant and have option prices
no less than fair market value at the date of grant.

On November 20, 2003, the Company’s shareholders
approved the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan
(“2003 Plan”). The 2003 Plan replaced the 1996
Plan, the Director Stock Option Plan and the 1994 Plan, under
all of which 5,697 shares remained available for granting
in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, SARs,
restricted stock or other types of awards. Under the 2003 Plan
the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the
fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant.
The 2003 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 4, 2013.
Options generally will expire no later than 10 years after
the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable
as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an
option or other award. Shares of restricted stock shall be
issued under the 2003 Plan for such consideration as is
determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. No award of restricted stock shall have a restriction
period of less than three years except as may be recommended by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or with
respect to any award of restricted stock which provides solely
for a performance-based risk of forfeiture so long as such award
has a restriction period of at least one year. Except for stock
options and restricted stock, no SARs or other types of awards
were outstanding as of December 31, 2004.

The following table details the weighted average remaining
contractual life of options outstanding at December 31,
2004 by range of exercise prices (in thousands, except per share
data):

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the
plans (in thousands, except per share data):

Options exercisable at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
were 6,084, 9,080 and 11,950, respectively. The weighted average
exercise prices of options exercisable at December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 were $31.98, $19.48 and $12.63, respectively.

During 2004, the Company granted seven thousand shares of
restricted stock. The restrictions on these shares lapse
January 30, 2007. The Company has recorded
$0.1 million of compensation expense during 2004 related to
the restricted stock grant. The weighted-average grant date fair
value on the grant date of the restricted stock was $33.12.

Shares available for grant under the 2003 Plan at
December 31, 2004 were 2,680.

As described in Note 2, regarding stock-based compensation,
the Company accelerated the vesting of approximately
238 thousand unvested stock options on December 31,
2004. This vesting acceleration has been reflected in the table
above for number of shares exercisable.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On February 26, 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible employees may
contribute up to 15% of their earnings toward the quarterly
purchase of the Company’s Common Stock. The plan makes
available 1,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock
commencing October 1, 1996. As of December 31, 2004,
approximately 610 shares have been issued under the plan. Each
plan period lasts three months beginning on January 1,
April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. The purchase
price for each share of stock is the lesser of 90% of the market
price on the first day of the plan period or 100% of the market
price on the last day of the plan period. No compensation
expense is recorded in connection with the plan.

Retirement Plans

U.S. Retirement Plans

The Company has two retirement plans for U.S. employees:
the Waters Employee Investment Plan, a defined contribution
plan, and the Waters Retirement Plan, a defined benefit cash
balance plan.

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters
Employee Investment Plan after one month of service. Employees
may contribute from 1% to 30% of eligible pay on a
pre-tax basis. After one year of service, the Company makes a
matching contribution of 50% for contributions up
to 6% of eligible pay. Employees are 100% vested in
employee and company matching contributions. For the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company’s
matching contributions amounted to $3.1 million,
$2.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively.

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters
Retirement Plan after one year of service. Annually, the Company
credits each employee’s account as a percentage of eligible
pay based on years of service. In addition, each employee’s
account is credited for investment returns at the beginning of
each year for the prior year at the average 12 month
Treasury Bill rate plus 0.5%, limited to a minimum rate
of 5% and a maximum rate of 10%. An employee does not
vest until the completion of five years of service at which time
the employee becomes 100% vested.

The net periodic pension cost under SFAS 87,
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, is made up
of several components that reflect different aspects of the
Company’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of
benefits earned by employees. These components are determined
using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method and are
based on certain actuarial assumptions. The Company’s
accounting policy is to reflect in the projected benefit
obligation all benefit changes to which the Company is committed

Prior to September 2002, the asset allocation targets were 72%
equity and 28% fixed income. The rebalancing towards the new
targets is accomplished through the investment of future
contributions.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The asset allocation policy was developed in consideration of
the following long-term investment objectives: achieving a
return on assets consistent with the investment policy,
maximizing portfolio returns with at least a return of 2.5%
above the one-year Treasury Bill rate, and achieving portfolio
returns which exceeds the average return for similarly invested
funds.

The Company increased its allocation to debt securities during
2003 from 26% to 32% based on the new target allocation. The
increase in fixed income securities will help better match the
interest rate sensitivity of the pension liabilities and limit
the risk associated with equity funds. Within the equity
portfolio, investments are diversified among capitalization and
style. Up to 20% of the equity portfolio may be invested in
financial markets outside of the United States. The Company does
not invest in its own stock within the pension assets.

The Company prohibits the following types of assets or
transactions: short selling, margin transactions, commodities
and future contracts, private placements, options and letter
stock.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
assumption, the Company considered the historical returns and
the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as
well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio and
historical expenses paid by the plan. This resulted in the
selection of the 8.00% long-term rate of return on assets
assumption, net of expenses paid by the plan.

During fiscal year 2005, the Company expects to contribute
approximately $7.5 million to the Plan.

20     Business Segment
Information

SFAS 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information,” establishes standards for
reporting information about operating segments in annual
financial statements and requires selected information for those
segments to be presented in interim financial reports of public
business enterprises. It also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and service, geographic areas and
major customers. The Company evaluated its business activities
that are regularly reviewed by the chief decision-makers for
which separate discrete financial information is available.

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2003, the Company completed
the integration of the LC and MS worldwide sales, service and
support organizations. Accordingly, the Micromass operating
segment (“Micromass”) has been integrated into the
Waters operating segment.

Waters Division is in the business of manufacturing and
distributing LC instruments, columns, other consumables and
mass spectrometry instruments that can be integrated and used
along with other analytical instruments. Additionally, and as a
result of the acquisitions of Creon Lab Control AG in July
2003 and NuGenesis Technologies Corporation in February 2004,
Waters Division entered the laboratory informatics market
(“Laboratory Informatics”), which consists of
laboratory-to-enterprise scale software systems for

managing and storing scientific information collected from a
wide variety of instrument test methods. TA Division is in
the business of manufacturing and distributing thermal analysis
and rheometry instruments. The Company’s two divisions are
its operating segments, which have similar economic
characteristics, product processes, products and services, types
and classes of customers, methods of distribution, and
regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two
segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for
financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated
financial statements for financial information regarding the one
reportable segment of the Company.

Unaudited Quarterly Results

The Company’s unaudited quarterly results are summarized
below (in thousands, except per share data):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company experiences a seasonal increase in sales in the
fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits on capital
goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets
by calendar year-end. Selling and administrative expenses were
lower in the first quarters of 2004 and 2003 compared to other
quarters in respective calendar years due to foreign currency
translation, lower spending in marketing programs and lower
costs such as sales commissions and incentive plans directly
related to sales volume. In addition, expenses are traditionally
higher in the second quarter of each year as this is the
Company’s annual payroll merit increase period. Selling and
administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2004 were
higher primarily due to increased spending for Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance and employee incentive plans versus the fourth
quarter of 2003.
