PART I

Item 1:

Business

General

Waters Corporation
    (“Waters

®

”

    or the “Company”), an analytical instrument
    manufacturer, primarily designs, manufactures, sells and
    services, through its Waters Division, high performance liquid
    chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid
    chromatography
    (“UPLC

®

”

    and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass
    spectrometry (“MS”) instrument systems and support
    products, including chromatography columns, other consumable
    products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These
    systems are complementary products that can be integrated
    together and used along with other analytical instruments.
    Through its TA Division
    (“TA

®

”),

    the Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services
    thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The
    Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based
    products that interface with the Company’s instruments as
    well as other manufacturers’ instruments.

The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, life
    science, biochemical, industrial, academic and government
    customers working in research and development, quality assurance
    and other laboratory applications. The Company’s LC and MS
    instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to
    detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and
    biological composition of materials, as well as to purify a full
    range of compounds. These instruments are used in drug discovery
    and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis
    of proteins in disease processes (known as
    “proteomics”), food safety analysis and environmental
    testing. The Company’s thermal analysis, rheometry and
    calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability
    of fine chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids for uses in
    various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as
    well as for life science research.

Waters is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding
    common stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating
    subsidiary. Waters became a publicly-traded company with its
    initial public offering (“IPO”) in November 1995.
    Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and
    complementary technologies to its range of products with the
    acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited
    (“Micromass

®

”)

    in September 1997.

Business
    Segments

The Company’s business activities, for which financial
    information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated
    by the chief operating decision makers. As a result of this
    evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating
    segments: Waters Division and TA Division. As indicated above,
    the Company operates in the analytical instruments industry,
    designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing products in
    three technologies: LC and MS instruments; columns and other
    chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with
    other analytical instruments; and thermal analysis, rheometry
    and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating
    segments, Waters Division and TA Division, have similar economic
    characteristics; product processes; products and services; types
    and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory
    environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments
    have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial
    statement purposes.

Information concerning revenues and long-lived assets
    attributable to each of the Company’s products, services
    and geographic areas is set forth in Note 16 in the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated
    herein by reference.

Waters
    Division

High
    Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid
    Chromatography

Developed in the 1950’s, HPLC is the standard technique
    used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a
    variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes
    that HPLC’s performance capabilities enable it to separate
    and identify approximately 80% of all known chemicals and
    materials. As a result, HPLC is used to



analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research
    and development purposes, quality control and process
    engineering applications.

The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served
    by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these
    markets, HPLC is used extensively to identify new drugs, develop
    manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new
    pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other
    applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for
    nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations, the
    testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing
    industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as
    chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by
    universities, research institutions and government agencies,
    such as the United States Food and Drug Administration
    (“FDA”) and the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency (“EPA”) and their international counterparts
    that mandate testing requiring HPLC instrumentation.

Traditionally, a typical HPLC system has consisted of five basic
    components: solvent delivery system, sample injector, separation
    column, detector and data acquisition unit. The solvent delivery
    system pumps solvents through the HPLC system, while the sample
    injector introduces samples into the solvent flow. The
    chromatography column then separates the sample into its
    components for analysis by the detector, which measures the
    presence and amount of the constituents. The data acquisition
    unit, usually referred to as the instrument’s software or
    data system, then records and stores the information from the
    detector.

In 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company
    describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that
    utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter
    particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY
    UPLC

®

,

    to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic
    bands that are generated by these small particles. By using the
    ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more
    comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in
    comparison with many analyses performed by HPLC. In addition, in
    using ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the
    range of applications beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to
    uncover new levels of scientific information. Though it offers
    significant performance advantages, ACQUITY UPLC is compatible
    with the Company’s software products and the general
    operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the
    Company’s customers and field sales and support
    organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology
    and instrument. In 2010, Waters introduced the ACQUITY
    UPLC

®

H-Class instrument system, which incorporates the performance of
    ACQUITY UPLC with the operational familiarity of traditional
    HPLC systems. The ACQUITY UPLC H-Class is a streamlined system
    that brings together the flexibility and simplicity of
    quaternary solvent blending and a flow-through needle injector
    to deliver the advanced performance expected of UPLC-type
    separations. The ACQUITY UPLC H-Class delivers high resolution,
    sensitivity and improved through-put while maintaining the
    robustness and reliability for which the ACQUITY systems are
    known. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company experienced
    growth in the LC instrument system product line primarily from
    the sales of ACQUITY UPLC and ACQUITY UPLC H-Class systems.

Waters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in
    configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation,
    from component configured systems for academic research
    applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing,
    and that have a variety of detection technologies, from
    ultra-violet (“UV”) absorbance to MS, optimized for
    certain analyses. The Company also manufactures tailored LC
    systems for the analysis of biologics, as well as an LC detector
    utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the
    usage of LC to compounds that are not amenable to UV absorbance
    detection.

The primary consumable products for LC are chromatography
    columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in
    the LC testing process and are replaced at regular intervals.
    The chromatography column contains one of several types of
    packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from
    silica. As the sample flows through the column, it is separated
    into its constituent components.

Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and
    competitors’ LC systems. The Company believes that it is
    one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica,
    packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the
    Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key
    attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and
    can react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company
    believes that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used nearly
    exclusively on its ACQUITY UPLC instrument systems and,
    furthermore, that its ACQUITY UPLC instrument primarily uses
    ACQUITY UPLC columns. In 2010, 2009 and



2008, the Company experienced growth in its LC chromatography
    column and sample preparation businesses, especially in ACQUITY
    UPLC columns.

The Company’s chemistry consumable products also include
    environmental and food safety testing products. Environmental
    laboratories use these products for quality control and
    proficiency testing and also purchase product support services
    required to help with their federal and state mandated
    accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical
    pharmaceutical analysis. In addition, the Company provides tests
    to identify and quantify mycotoxins in various agricultural
    commodities. These test kits provide reliable, quantitative
    detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of
    flurometer, LC-MS or HPLC.

In February 2009, the Company acquired Thar Instruments, Inc.
    (“Thar”), a global leader in the design, development
    and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical
    fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction
    (“SFC”) systems.

Based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and
    publicly-disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company
    believes that it is one of the world’s largest
    manufacturers and distributors of LC instruments, chromatography
    columns and other consumables and related services. The Company
    also believes that it has the leading LC market share in the
    United States, Europe and Asia, and believes it has a leading
    market share position in Japan.

Mass
    Spectrometry

MS is a powerful analytical technique that is used to identify
    unknown compounds, to quantify known materials and to elucidate
    the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring
    the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into
    ions.

The Company believes it is a market leader in the development,
    manufacture, sale and distribution of MS instruments. These
    instruments can be integrated and used along with other
    complementary analytical instruments and systems, such as LC,
    chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis
    chromatography and gas chromatography. A wide variety of
    instrumental designs fall within the overall category of MS
    instrumentation, including devices that incorporate quadrupole,
    ion trap,

time-of-flight

(“Tof”) and classical magnetic sector technologies.
    Furthermore, these technologies are often used in tandem to
    maximize the efficacy of certain experiments.

Currently, the Company offers a wide range of MS instruments
    utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof, ion mobility
    and magnetic sector designs. These instruments are used in drug
    discovery and development, as well as for environmental and food
    safety testing. The majority of mass spectrometers sold by the
    Company are designed to utilize an LC system as the sample
    introduction device. These products supply a diverse market with
    a strong emphasis on the life science, pharmaceutical,
    biomedical, clinical, food and environmental market segments
    worldwide.

The mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection
    device for LC. The Company’s smaller-sized mass
    spectrometers, such as the single quadrupole detector
    (“SQD”) and the tandem quadrupole detector
    (“TQD”), are often referred to as LC
    “detectors” and are either sold as part of an LC
    system or as an LC system upgrade. Larger quadrupole systems,
    such as the
    Xevo

®

TQ and Quattro
    Premier

tm

XE instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for
    late-stage drug development, including clinical trial testing.
    Quadrupole

time-of-flight

(“Q-Tof

tm

”)

    instruments, such as the Company’s
    SYNAPT

®

MS, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease
    processes, an application sometimes referred to as
    “proteomics”. In 2008, the Company introduced a new
    Q-Tof instrument called the SYNAPT MS. This instrument is an
    improved version of the Q-Tof
    Premier

tm

that customers may opt to upgrade to
    SYNAPT

®

HDMS

tm

capability. In late 2008, the
    Xevo

®

Q-Tof

tm

MS, an exact mass MS/MS bench-top instrument, was introduced. In
    late 2009, the Company introduced the
    SYNAPT

®

G2
    HDMS

tm

system. The SYNAPT G2 HDMS and
    SYNAPT

®

G2 MS systems are high resolution exact mass MS/MS platforms
    that are performance-enhanced replacements for the SYNAPT HDMS
    and SYNAPT MS systems. The performance enhancements offered by
    these new systems allow for higher resolution shape
    discrimination by the HDMS version and superior mass resolution,
    mass accuracy and quantification accuracy by both versions. In
    2010, the Company introduced the
    Xevo

®

TQ-S instrument system, which is designed for the most demanding

UPLC/MS/MS

applications. Also in 2010, the Company introduced the
    Xevo

®

G2
    Q-Tof

tm

instrument system.



The Xevo G2 Q-Tof is one of the most sensitive, exact mass
    quantitative and qualitative bench-top MS/MS instrument system
    developed because it combines the integrated workflow benefits
    of Engineered
    Simplicity

tm

found in existing Xevo Q-Tof instrument systems with the ground
    breaking Quantof technology of the SYNAPT G2 instrument system.

LC-MS

LC and MS are instrumental technologies often embodied within an
    analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of
    analyses or as a general purpose analytical device. An
    increasing percentage of the Company’s customers are
    purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it is
    becoming common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within
    the same laboratory and operated by the same user. The
    descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical
    segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical
    categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly
    in today’s instrument market, this segmentation and
    categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of
    instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS
    technologies as part of a single device. In response to this
    development and to further promote the high utilization of these
    hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters
    Division to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated
    LC-MS systems.

Waters
    Division Service

The servicing and support of LC and MS instruments and
    accessories is an important source of revenue for the Waters
    Division. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale
    of support plans, demand service, customer training and
    performance validation services. Support plans most typically
    involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to
    promptly repair a non-functioning instrument in return for a fee
    described in a contract that is priced according to the
    configuration of the instrument.

TA
    Division

Thermal
    Analysis, Rheometry and Calorimetry

Thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of
    materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature
    affect several characteristics of materials, such as their
    physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical
    properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal
    analysis techniques, including calorimetry. Consequently,
    thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development,
    production and characterization of materials in various
    industries, such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles,
    pharmaceuticals and electronics.

Rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in
    characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow
    properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity
    and deformation under different types of “loading” or
    conditions. The information obtained under such conditions
    provides insight into a material’s behavior during
    manufacturing, transport, usage and storage.

Thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are heavily used in
    material testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide
    information useful in predicting the suitability of fine
    chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial,
    consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life
    science research. As with systems offered through the Waters
    Division, a range of instrumental configurations are available
    with increasing levels of sample handling and information
    processing automation. In addition, systems and accompanying
    software packages can be tailored for specific applications. For
    example, the
    Q-Series

tm

family of differential scanning calorimeters includes a range of
    instruments, from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive
    systems that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a
    variety of sample cells and temperature control features for
    analyzing a broad range of materials. In 2009, TA introduced the
    ARES G2 rheometer, a high performance system uniquely capable of
    independently measuring stress and strain for a wide variety of
    solids and liquids. In 2010, TA introduced the Nano ITC Low
    Volume system, which is engineered to provide isothermal
    titration calorimetry capabilities for applications with limited
    sample sizes. Also in 2010, TA introduced the DMA-RH Accessory,
    which is designed to be used with the Q800 Dynamic Mechanical
    Analyzer to allow the mechanical properties of a sample to be
    analyzed under controlled

and/or

varying conditions of both relative humidity and temperature.



In July 2008, the Company acquired VTI Corporation
    (“VTI”), a manufacturer of sorption analysis and
    thermogravimetric analysis (“TGA”) instruments.
    VTI’s products are widely used in the evaluation of
    pharmaceuticals, catalysts and energy-related materials. This
    acquisition added two technologies which complement TA’s
    existing gravimetric analysis product line. VTI’s sorption
    analysis products are designed for water and organic vapor
    sorption studies of pharmaceuticals and related materials.
    VTI’s high pressure, high vacuum TGA projects are designed
    for high pressure sorption studies, which are commonly used in
    the analysis of energy-related materials.

TA
    Service

The Company sells, supports and services TA’s product
    offerings through its headquarters in New Castle, Delaware. TA
    operates independently from the Waters Division, though several
    of its overseas offices are situated in Waters’ facilities.
    TA has dedicated field sales and service operations. Service
    sales are primarily derived from the sale of replacement parts
    and from billed labor fees associated with the repair,
    maintenance and upgrade of installed systems.

Customers

The Company has a broad and diversified customer base that
    includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts,
    universities and government agencies. The pharmaceutical segment
    represents the Company’s largest sector and includes
    multinational pharmaceutical companies, generic drug
    manufacturers, contract research organizations (CROs) and
    biotechnology companies. The Company’s other industrial
    customers include chemical manufacturers, polymer manufacturers,
    food and beverage companies and environmental testing
    laboratories. The Company also sells to various universities and
    government agencies worldwide. The Company’s technical
    support staff works closely with its customers in developing and
    implementing applications that meet their full range of
    analytical requirements.

The Company experiences an increase in sales in the fourth
    quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of
    customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by
    calendar year end. The Company does not rely on any single
    customer or one group of customers for a material portion of its
    sales. During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, no single
    customer accounted for more than 3% of the Company’s net
    sales.

Sales and
    Service

The Company has one of the largest sales and service
    organizations in the industry, focused exclusively on the
    various instrument systems’ installed base. Across these
    product technologies, using respective specialized sales and
    service forces, the Company serves its customer base with
    approximately 2,700 field representatives in 89 sales offices
    throughout the world as of December 31, 2010. The
    Company’s sales representatives have direct responsibility
    for account relationships, while service representatives work in
    the field to install instruments, train customers and minimize
    instrument downtime. In-house, technical support representatives
    work directly with customers providing them assistance with
    applications and procedures on Company products. The Company
    provides customers with comprehensive information through
    various corporate and regional internet websites and product
    literature, and also makes consumable products available through
    electronic ordering facilities and a dedicated catalog.

Manufacturing

The Company provides high quality LC products by overseeing each
    stage of the production of its instruments, columns and chemical
    reagents. The Company currently assembles a portion of its LC
    instruments at its facility in Milford, Massachusetts, where it
    performs machining, assembly and testing. The Milford facility
    maintains quality management and environmental management
    systems in accordance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2008,
    ISO 13485:2003 and ISO 14001:2004, and adheres to applicable
    regulatory requirements (including the FDA Quality System
    Regulation and the European In-Vitro Diagnostic Directive). The
    Company outsources manufacturing of certain electronic
    components, such as computers, monitors and circuit boards, to
    outside vendors that can meet the Company’s quality
    requirements. In 2006, the Company transitioned the
    manufacturing of LC instrument systems



and components to a well-established contract manufacturing firm
    in Singapore. The Company has continued to pursue outsourcing
    opportunities as they may arise.

The Company manufactures its LC columns at its facilities in
    Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland, where it processes,
    sizes and treats silica and polymeric media that are packed into
    columns, solid phase extraction cartridges and bulk shipping
    containers. The Wexford facility also manufactures and
    distributes certain data, instruments and software components
    for the Company’s LC, MS and TA product lines. The
    Company’s Taunton facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008.
    The Wexford facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008 and ISO
    13485:2003.

    manufactures SFC systems in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The Company manufactures most of its MS products at its
    facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire, England and
    Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the
    Company’s MS instruments are manufactured by long-standing
    outside contractors. Each stage of this supply chain is closely
    monitored by the Company to maintain high quality and
    performance standards. The instruments, components or modules
    are then returned to the Company’s facilities where its
    engineers perform final assembly, calibrations to customer
    specifications and quality control procedures. The
    Company’s MS facilities are certified to ISO 9001:2008 and
    ISO 13485:2003.

    and Development

The Company maintains an active research and development program
    focused on the development and commercialization of products
    that both complement and update its existing product offering.
    The Company’s research and development expenditures for
    2010, 2009 and 2008 were $84 million, $77 million and
    $82 million, respectively. Nearly all of the Company’s
    current LC products were developed at the Company’s main
    research and development center located in Milford,
    Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the Company’s
    extensive field organizations and customers. The majority of the
    Company’s MS products were developed at facilities in
    England and nearly all of the Company’s current thermal
    analysis products were developed at the Company’s research
    and development center in New Castle, Delaware. At
    December 31, 2010, there were 697 employees involved
    in the Company’s research and development efforts. The
    Company has increased research and development expenses relating
    to acquisitions and the Company’s continued commitment to
    invest significantly in new product development and existing
    product enhancements. Despite the Company’s active research
    and development programs, there can be no assurances that the
    Company’s product development and commercialization efforts
    will be successful or that the products developed by the Company
    will be accepted by the marketplace.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 5,400 employees at
    December 31, 2010, with approximately 44% of the
    Company’s employees located in the United States. The
    Company believes its employee relations are generally good. The
    Company’s employees are not unionized or affiliated with
    any internal or external labor organizations. The Company
    believes that its future success largely depends upon its
    continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees.



Competition

The analytical instrument and systems market is highly
    competitive. The Company encounters competition from several
    worldwide instrument manufacturers and other companies in both
    domestic and foreign markets for each of its three technologies.
    The Company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of
    instrument performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser
    extent, price. Some competitors have instrument businesses that
    are generally more diversified than the Company’s business,
    but are typically less focused on the Company’s chosen
    markets. Some competitors have greater financial and other
    resources than the Company.

In the markets served by the Waters Division, the Company’s
    principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc.,
    Shimadzu Corporation, Bruker BioSciences, Danaher Corporation,
    Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Dionex Corporation (which has
    announced an agreement to be acquired by Thermo Fisher
    Scientific Inc). In the markets served by the TA Division, the
    Company’s principal competitors include: PerkinElmer, Inc.,
    Mettler-Toledo International Inc., NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH,
    Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern Instruments Ltd.,
    Anton-Paar and General Electric Company.

The market for consumable LC products, including separation
    columns, is highly competitive and more fragmented than the
    analytical instruments market. The Company encounters
    competition in the consumable columns market from chemical
    companies that produce column chemicals and small specialized
    companies that pack and distribute columns. The Company believes
    that it is one of the few suppliers that processes silica, packs
    columns and distributes its own product. The Company competes in
    this market on the basis of reproducibility, reputation,
    performance and, to a lesser extent, price. The Company’s
    principal competitors for consumable products include:
    Phenomenex, Inc., Supelco, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc.,
    General Electric Company, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and
    Merck and Co., Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to
    offer a predictable level of performance when used with ACQUITY
    UPLC columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the
    ACQUITY UPLC instrument base will enhance its chromatographic
    column business because of the high level of synergy between
    ACQUITY UPLC columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instrument. In 2009,
    Agilent Technologies, Inc. introduced a new LC system, which it
    termed a UHPLC, and which it has claimed has similar performance
    characteristics to Waters’ ACQUITY UPLC.

Patents,
    Trademarks and Licenses

The Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents
    and has patent applications pending in the United States and
    abroad. Certain technology and software is licensed from third
    parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The
    Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as
    valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes
    that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is,
    in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss
    would materially affect the Company’s business as a whole.

Environmental
    Matters and Climate Change

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws,
    regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or
    operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as
    discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal
    practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose
    liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages
    resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases
    of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently
    conducts its operations and has operated its business in the
    past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental
    laws. From time to time, Company operations have resulted or may
    result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for
    cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The Company does not
    currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its
    operations, financial condition or competitive position as a
    result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws.

The Company is sensitive to the growing global debate with
    respect to climate change. In the first quarter of 2009, the
    Company published its first sustainability report identifying
    the various actions and behaviors the Company has adopted
    concerning its commitment to both the environment and the
    broader topic of social responsibility. An internal
    sustainability working group was formed and is functioning to
    develop increasingly robust data with respect to the
    Company’s utilization of carbon producing substances. See
    Item 1A, Risk Factors — Effects of Climate
    Change, for more information on the potential significance of
    climate change legislation.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the
    analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to,
    the following:

Global
    Economic Conditions

The Company is a global business that may be adversely affected
    by changes in global economic conditions. These changes in
    global economic conditions may affect the demand for the
    Company’s products and services and may result in a decline
    in sales in the future. There can be no assurance that the
    strong demand for the Company’s products and services will
    continue in the future.

Financial
    Market Conditions

Financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have experienced
    times of extreme disruption over the past few years, including,
    among other things, sharp increases in the cost of new capital,
    severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced
    liquidity in money markets. Financial and banking institutions
    have also experienced disruptions, resulting in large asset
    write-downs, higher costs of capital, rating downgrades and
    reduced desire to lend money. While currently these disruptions
    have not impacted the Company’s ability to access its
    existing cash or borrow on its existing revolving credit
    facility, there can be no assurance that there will not be
    future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial
    markets or financial institutions. Any future deterioration or
    prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial
    institutions in which the Company participates may impair the
    Company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving
    credit facility and impair its ability to access sources of new
    capital. The Company’s cost of any new capital raised and
    interest expense would increase if this were to occur.

Customer
    Demand

The demand for the Company’s products is dependent upon the
    size of the markets for its LC, MS, thermal analysis, rheometry
    and calorimetry products; the timing and level of capital
    expenditures of the Company’s customers; changes in
    government regulations, particularly effecting drug, food and
    drinking water testing; funding available to academic and
    government institutions; general economic conditions and the
    rate of economic growth in the Company’s major markets; and
    competitive considerations. The Company typically experiences an
    increase in sales in its fourth quarter, as a result of
    purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to
    exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. There can
    be no assurance that the Company’s results of operations or
    financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change
    in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of
    weakness in global economic conditions.

Additionally, the analytical instrument market may, from time to
    time, experience low sales growth. Approximately 52% and 51% of
    the Company’s net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively,
    were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    industries, which may be periodically subject to unfavorable
    market conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable industry
    conditions could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations or financial condition.



Competition
    and the Analytical Instrument Market

The analytical instrument market and, in particular, the portion
    related to the Company’s HPLC, UPLC, MS, LC-MS, thermal
    analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines, is highly
    competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. The
    Company encounters competition from several international
    instrument manufacturers and other companies in both domestic
    and foreign markets. Some competitors have instrument businesses
    that are generally more diversified than the Company’s
    business, but are typically less focused on the Company’s
    chosen markets. There can be no assurance that the
    Company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and
    less costly products than those of the Company or that the
    Company will be able to increase its sales and profitability
    from new product introductions. There can be no assurance that
    the Company’s sales and marketing forces will compete
    successfully against its competitors in the future.

Levels of
    Debt and Debt Service Requirements

The Company had approximately $766 million in debt and
    $946 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments as of December 31, 2010. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company also had the ability to
    borrow an additional $543 million from its existing credit
    facilities. Most of the Company’s debt is in the
    U.S. There is a substantial cash requirement in the
    U.S. to fund operations and capital expenditures, service
    debt interest obligations, finance potential acquisitions and
    continue authorized stock repurchase programs. A majority of the
    Company’s cash is generated from foreign operations, and
    most of the Company’s cash is held in foreign operations.
    The Company’s financial condition and results of operations
    could be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to maintain
    a sufficient level of cash flow in the U.S. to address
    these requirements through cash from U.S. operations,
    efficient and timely repatriation of cash from overseas, the
    Company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving
    credit facility and other sources obtained at an acceptable
    cost. The Company’s 2007 Credit Agreement expires in
    January 2012. The outstanding debt balance of this credit
    agreement on December 31, 2010 was $555 million. There
    can be no assurance that the Company will be able to refinance
    this debt.

Debt
    Covenants

The Company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants
    that limit the Company’s ability to engage in certain
    activities that could otherwise benefit the Company. These debt
    covenants include restrictions on the Company’s ability to
    enter into certain contracts or agreements that may limit the
    Company’s ability to make dividend or other payments;
    secure other indebtedness; enter into transactions with
    affiliates and consolidate, merge or transfer all or
    substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Company is
    also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms
    of the Company’s debt agreements. The Company’s
    ability to comply with these financial restrictions and
    covenants is dependent on the Company’s future performance,
    which is subject to, but not limited to, prevailing economic
    conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond
    the Company’s control, such as foreign exchange rates,
    interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level
    of competition.

Risk of
    Disruption of Operations

The Company manufactures LC instruments at facilities in
    Milford, Massachusetts and through a subcontractor in Singapore;
    chemistry separation columns at its facilities in Taunton,
    Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland; MS products at its
    facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire, England and
    Wexford, Ireland; thermal analysis products at its facility in
    New Castle, Delaware; rheometry products at its facilities in
    New Castle, Delaware and Crawley, England and other instruments
    and consumables at various other locations as a result of the
    Company’s acquisitions. Any prolonged disruption to the
    operations at any of these facilities, whether due to labor
    difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility or other
    reasons, could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

Sovereign
    Risk, Foreign Operations and Exchange Rates

Approximately 70% and 69% of the Company’s net sales in
    2010 and 2009, respectively, were outside of the United States
    and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies. In
    addition, the Company has considerable manufacturing operations
    in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Singapore. As a result, a
    significant portion of the Company’s sales and operations
    are subject to certain risks, including adverse developments in
    the foreign political and economic environment, in particular,
    the financial difficulties experienced by a number of European
    countries, including Ireland; sudden movements in a
    country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a
    country’s sovereign



risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices; tariffs
    and other trade barriers; difficulties in staffing and managing
    foreign operations; and potentially adverse tax consequences.

Additionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s
    net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses, interest, taxes
    and net income varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
    Significant increases or decreases in the value of the
    U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could
    have a material adverse effect or benefit on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial condition.

Reliance
    on Key Management

The operation of the Company requires managerial and operational
    expertise. None of the key management employees have an
    employment contract with the Company and there can be no
    assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company.
    If, for any reason, such key personnel do not continue to be
    active in management, the Company’s results of operations
    or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Protection
    of Intellectual Property

The Company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights
    and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as
    material and patentable. However, there can be no assurance that
    any patents held by the Company will not be challenged,
    invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted
    thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company.
    Conversely, there could be successful claims against the Company
    by third-party patent holders with respect to certain Company
    products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of
    such third parties. The Company’s patents, including those
    licensed from others, expire on various dates. If the Company is
    unable to protect its intellectual property rights, it could
    have an adverse and material effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial condition.

Reliance
    on Suppliers

Most of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by
    the Company are available from a number of different suppliers;
    however, a number of items are purchased from limited or single
    sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have a
    temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results
    of the Company. The Company believes alternative sources could
    ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials, but a
    prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components
    could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition or results of operations and could result in damage to
    its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely
    affect the Company’s business.

Use of
    Outside Manufacturers

Certain components or modules of the Company’s LC and MS
    instruments are manufactured by long-standing outside
    contractors, including the manufacturing of LC instrument
    systems and related components by a well-established contract
    manufacturing firm in Singapore. Disruptions of service by these
    outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply
    chain and the financial results of the Company. The Company
    believes that it could obtain alternative sources for these
    components or modules, but a prolonged inability to obtain these
    components or modules could have an adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Risk of
    Unexpected Shifts in Pre-Tax Income between Tax
    Jurisdictions

The Company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0%
    to in excess of 35% in various jurisdictions in which it does
    business. In addition, the Company typically generates a
    substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each
    fiscal year. Geographical shifts in income from previous
    quarters’ projections caused by factors including, but not
    limited to, changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations
    in foreign currency translation rates, could therefore have
    potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the
    Company’s income tax expense, effective tax rate and
    results of operations. In addition, the Company’s Ireland
    statutory tax rate will increase to 12.5% in 2011 from the
    historical contractual tax rate of 10%, and further increases
    are possible.

Effects
    of Climate Change

The Company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its
    products involve the use of chemical and other substances that
    are regulated under various international, federal, state and
    local laws governing the environment. In the event



that any future climate change legislation would require that
    stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international
    environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use

and/or

levels of possible emissions from such chemicals

and/or

other
    substances, the Company may be required to make certain changes
    and adaptations to its manufacturing processes. Any such changes
    could have a material effect on the financial statements of the
    Company.

Another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the
    severity of global weather conditions. The Company manufactures
    a growing percentage of its HPLC, UPLC and MS products in both
    Singapore and Wexford, Ireland. Although the Company believes it
    has an adequate disaster recovery plan in place, severe weather
    conditions, including earthquakes, hurricanes

and/or

tsunami, could potentially cause significant damage to the
    Company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these
    countries. The effects of such damage and the resultant
    disruption of manufacturing operations could have a materially
    adverse impact to the financial results of the Company.

Regulatory
    Compliance

The Company is subject to regulation by various federal, state
    and foreign governments and agencies in areas including, among
    others, health and safety, import/export and environmental. A
    portion of the Company’s operations are subject to
    regulation by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies.
    These regulations are complex and govern an array of product
    activities, including design, development, labeling,
    manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. Any failure by
    the Company to comply with applicable government regulations
    could result in product recalls, the imposition of fines,
    restrictions on the Company’s ability to conduct or expand
    its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its
    operations.

Some of the Company’s operations are subject to domestic
    and international laws and regulations with respect to the
    manufacture, handling, use or sale of toxic or hazardous
    substances. This requires the Company to devote substantial
    resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and
    regulations. If the Company fails to comply with such
    requirements in the manufacture or distribution of its products,
    it could face civil

and/or

criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from
    distributing or selling such products until they are compliant.

Some of the Company’s products are also subject to the
    rules of certain industrial standards bodies, such as the
    International Standards Organization. The Company must comply
    with these rules, as well as those of other agencies, such as
    those of the United States Occupational Health and Safety
    Administration. Failure to comply with such rules could result
    in the loss of certification

and/or

the
    imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s operations.

Properties

Waters operates 23 United States facilities and 75 international
    facilities, including field offices. In 2010, the Company
    entered into an agreement to purchase land in the United Kingdom
    to construct a new facility, which will consolidate certain
    existing primary manufacturing locations. The Company believes
    that the new building and its other existing facilities are
    suitable and adequate for its current production level and for
    reasonable growth over the next several years. The

Item 3:

Legal
    Proceedings

Agilent
    Technologies, Inc.

The Company filed suit in the United States against
    Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH (collectively,
    “HP”), seeking a declaration that certain products
    sold under the mark “Alliance” did not constitute an
    infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or its foreign
    subsidiaries (the “HP patents”). The action in the
    United States was dismissed for lack of controversy. Actions
    seeking revocation or nullification of foreign HP patents were
    filed by the Company in Germany, France and England. A German
    patent tribunal found the HP German patent to be valid. In
    Germany, France and England, HP and its successor, Agilent
    Technologies Deutschland GmbH (“Agilent”), brought
    actions alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump may
    infringe the HP patents. In England, the Court of Appeal found
    the HP patent valid and infringed. The Company’s petitions
    for leave to appeal to the House of Lords were denied. A trial
    on damages was scheduled for November 2004.

In March 2004, Agilent brought a new action against the Company
    alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump continued to
    infringe the HP patents. In December 2004, following a trial in
    the new action, the UK court ruled that the Company did not
    infringe the HP patents. Agilent filed an appeal in that action,
    which was heard in July 2005, and the UK Appellate Court upheld
    the lower court’s ruling of non-infringement. In December
    2005, a trial on damages commenced in the first action and
    continued for six days prior to a holiday recess. In February
    2006, the Company, HP and Agilent entered into a settlement
    agreement (the “Agilent Settlement Agreement”) with
    respect to the first action and a consent order dismissing the
    case was entered. The Agilent Settlement Agreement provides for
    the release of the Company and its UK affiliate from each and
    every claim under Agilent’s European patent (UK) number
    309,596 arising out of the prior sale by either of them of
    Alliance Separations Modules incorporating the patented
    technology. In consideration of entering into the Agilent
    Settlement Agreement and the consent order, the Company made a
    payment to Agilent of 3.5 million British Pounds, in full
    and final settlement of Agilent’s claim for damages and in
    relation to all claims for costs and interest in the case.

In France, the Paris District Court found the HP patent valid
    and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company appealed the
    French decision and, in April 2004, the French appeals court
    affirmed the Paris District Court’s finding of
    infringement. The Company filed a further appeal in the case and
    the appeal was dismissed in March 2007. In January 2009, the
    French appeals court affirmed that the Company had infringed the
    Agilent patent and a judgment was issued against the Company.
    The Company has appealed this judgment. In the meantime,
    however, the Company recorded a $7 million provision in
    2008 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection
    with this case. The accrued patent litigation expense is in
    other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at
    December 31, 2010. In addition, the Company sought a
    declaration from the French court that, as was found in both the
    UK and Germany, certain modified features of the Alliance pump
    do not infringe the HP patents. A hearing on this matter was
    held in September 2007 and, in December 2007, the French court
    held that the modified features of the Alliance pump are
    non-infringing. Agilent appealed this ruling and, in January
    2010, the French appeals court affirmed the finding of
    non-infringement with respect to the modified features of the
    Alliance pump.

In the German case, a German court found the patent infringed.
    The Company appealed the German decision and, in December 2004,
    the German appeals court reversed the trial court and issued a
    finding of non-infringement in favor of the Company. Agilent
    sought an appeal in that action and the appeal was heard in
    April 2007. Following the hearing, the German Federal Court of
    Justice set aside the judgment of the appeals court and remanded
    the case back to the appeals court for further proceedings. In
    2008, the appeals court found the patent infringed. The Company
    has appealed this finding to the German Federal Court of
    Justice. In July 2005, Agilent brought a new action against the
    Company alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump
    continued to infringe the HP patents. In August 2006, following
    a trial in this new action, the German court ruled that the
    Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent filed an appeal
    in this action. A hearing on this appeal was held in January
    2008. The appeals court affirmed the finding of the trial court
    that the Company did not infringe. Agilent has appealed this
    finding to the German Federal Court of Justice.

The Company recorded provisions in 2004, 2005 and 2008 for
    estimated damages, legal fees and court costs to be incurred
    with respect to this ongoing litigation. The provisions
    represent management’s best estimate of the probable and
    reasonably estimable loss related to the litigations.



City of
    Dearborn Heights

In November 2008, the City of Dearborn Heights Act 345
    Police & Fire Retirement System filed a purported
    federal securities class action against the Company, Douglas
    Berthiaume and John Ornell in the United States District Court
    for the District of Massachusetts (the “Dearborn
    action”). In April 2009, lead plaintiff, Inter-Local
    Pension Fund GCC/IBT, filed a complaint that alleges, on
    behalf of a purported class of all persons who purchased stock
    of the Company between July 24, 2007 and January 22,
    2008, that between those dates the Company misrepresented or
    omitted material information about its projected annual revenues
    and earnings, its projected effective annual tax rate and the
    level of business activity in Japan. The amended complaint
    sought to recover under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act,

Rule 10b-5

thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. In March
    of 2010, the District Court granted the Company’s motion to
    dismiss the case for failure to state a claim upon which relief
    could be granted. Plaintiff filed an appeal of that dismissal in
    April 2010. In January 2011, the United States Court of Appeals
    affirmed the dismissal of the case by the District Court.

    entitled “Selected Financial Data” and is incorporated
    by reference from page 66 of this

Form 10-K,

included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data, and should be considered an integral part of this
    Item 6.

Item 7:

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Business
    and Financial Overview

The Company has two operating segments: the Waters Division and
    the TA Division
    (“TA

®

”).

    The Waters Division’s products and services primarily
    consist of high performance liquid chromatography
    (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography
    (“UPLC

®

”

    and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass
    spectrometry (“MS”) and chemistry consumable products
    and related services. TA products and services primarily consist
    of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument
    systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used
    by pharmaceutical, life science, biochemical, industrial, food
    safety, academic and governmental customers.



These customers use the Company’s products to detect,
    identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and
    biological composition of materials and to predict the
    suitability of fine chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids in
    consumer goods and healthcare products.

The Company’s sales were $1,643 million,
    $1,499 million and $1,575 million in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Sales increased 10% in 2010 as compared to
    2009 and sales decreased 5% in 2009 as compared to 2008. In
    2010, as compared with 2009, instrument system sales increased
    12% while combined sales of chemistry consumables and services
    increased 7%. These increases in sales were primarily due to
    higher demand for the Company’s products and services
    resulting from improvement in global economic conditions as
    compared to the prior year, introduction of new products,
    including the ACQUITY
    UPLC

instrument systems, and an increase in pharmaceutical and
    industrial spending on the Company’s LC, MS and TA
    products. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on
    sales in 2010. The 2009 decline in sales as compared to 2008 was
    primarily due to lower instrument spending by the Company’s
    customers as a result of global economic recessionary conditions
    and, to a lesser extent, the effect of foreign currency
    translation.

Waters Division sales increased 9% in 2010 as compared to 2009
    and decreased 4% in 2009 as compared to 2008. Foreign currency
    translation had minimal impact on Waters Division sales in 2010
    and decreased sales by 2% in 2009. TA’s sales increased 17%
    in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased 11% in 2009 as
    compared to 2008. Foreign currency translation had minimal
    impact on TA’s sales in 2010 and 2009.

During 2010, as compared with 2009, sales increased 21% in Asia
    (including Japan), 9% in the U.S. and 13% in the rest of
    the world, while sales were flat in Europe. The effect of
    foreign currency translation decreased sales in 2010 by 4% in
    Europe and increased sales by 4% in Asia and 3% in the rest of
    the world. During 2009, as compared with 2008, sales increased
    1% in Asia while sales decreased 4% in the U.S., 9% in Europe
    and 12% in the rest of the world. The effect of foreign currency
    translation decreased sales in 2009 by 6% in Europe and 3% in
    the rest of the world and increased sales by 2% in Asia.

In 2010, as compared to 2009, sales to pharmaceutical customers
    increased 12% and sales to industrial, food safety and
    environmental customers increased 14%. These increases were
    primarily a result of increased spending on instrument systems,
    chemistry consumables and services by the Company’s
    customers as global economic conditions improved as compared to
    the prior year. Combined global sales to government and academic
    customers were 5% higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 and were
    primarily attributed to sales of newly introduced LC and LC-MS
    systems and strong global academic spending that occurred in
    Asia. In 2009, as compared to 2008, sales to pharmaceutical
    customers decreased 4% and sales to industrial and environmental
    customers decreased 11%. These decreases were primarily a result
    of reduced spending on instrument systems caused by the global
    economic recession and, to a lesser extent, the strengthening of
    the U.S. dollar in developing economies, including India,
    South America and Eastern Europe. Combined global sales to
    government and academic customers were 5% higher in 2009 and the
    increase was primarily attributed to sales of newly introduced
    MS instrument systems, higher ACQUITY UPLC instrument system
    sales and global governmental stimulus spending programs.

Operating income was $450 million, $395 million and
    $390 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    overall increase in operating income in 2010 as compared to 2009
    was primarily from the increases in sales volumes with
    relatively similar product mix and gross margin percentages and
    benefits from lower spending earlier in 2010. Foreign currency
    translation had minimal comparative impact on operating income.
    The increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 was attributed to
    benefits of foreign currency translation and sales mix combined
    with lower spending. These increases were partially offset by
    the impact of $6 million of expense in connection with the
    TA building lease termination payment and $3 million of
    severance costs related to a restructuring in Europe.

Net income per diluted share was $4.06, $3.34 and $3.21 in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Net income per diluted share was
    primarily impacted by the following factors in 2010, 2009 and
    2008:

•

The benefits from higher sales volumes and the benefits from a
    shift in pretax income to lower tax rate jurisdictions increased
    net income per diluted share in 2010 as compared to 2009 and
    2008.

•

In 2010, an $8 million tax benefit was recorded related to
    the reversal for uncertain tax positions due to an audit
    settlement in the United Kingdom and a $2 million tax
    benefit related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax
    exposure. These tax benefits added $0.10 per diluted share to
    2010.



•

The $6 million TA building lease termination expense
    recorded in 2009 increased selling and administrative expenses
    and lowered net income per diluted share by $0.04 in 2009.

•

A $5 million tax benefit was recorded in 2009 related to
    the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities and added
    $0.05 per diluted share to 2009.

•

The impact of the 2008

out-of-period

adjustments related to capitalized software amortization
    increased 2008 net income per diluted share by $0.08.

•

Lower weighted-average shares and equivalents, as a result of
    the Company’s share buyback program, increased net income
    per diluted share in 2010 as compared to 2009 and 2009 as
    compared to 2008.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $458 million,
    $418 million and $418 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The $40 million increase in the operating
    cash flow in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily a result of
    higher net income, lower incentive compensation payments made in
    2010 as compared to 2009 and a $6 million litigation
    payment and $6 million TA building lease termination
    payment made in 2009, as well as timing of receipts from
    customers and payments to vendors. The 2009 cash provided by
    operating activities was consistent with the 2008 cash provided
    by operating activities despite the lower sales volume and
    global economic recession.

Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital
    expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software
    capitalization were $63 million, $94 million and
    $69 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital
    expenditures were higher in 2009 primarily due to the
    acquisition of land and construction of a new TA facility, which
    was completed in June 2009. In 2010, the Company entered into an
    agreement (subject to local regulatory approval) to purchase
    land in the United Kingdom to construct a new facility, which
    will consolidate certain existing primary manufacturing
    locations. The Company spent $3 million in 2010 in relation
    to this new facility and expects to incur capital expenditures
    in the next few years in the range of $70 million to
    $90 million to construct this facility.

The Company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital
    stock of Thar Instruments, Inc. (“Thar”) for
    $36 million in cash in February 2009. The Company continues
    to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and
    technologies to augment the Waters and TA operating divisions.

Within cash flows used in financing activities, the Company
    received $101 million, $19 million and
    $29 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts were primarily
    attributed to changes in the Company’s stock price and the
    expiration of stock option grants. In February 2009, the
    Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
    repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common
    stock over a two-year period. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company repurchased $292 million, $210 million and
    $235 million of the Company’s outstanding common
    stock, respectively, under the February 2009 authorization and
    previously announced stock repurchase programs. In February
    2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
    Company to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of
    its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. The Company
    believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these
    share repurchases given current cash and debt levels, as well as
    to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to
    further grow the Company’s sales and profits.

In February 2010, the Company issued and sold five-year senior
    unsecured notes at an interest rate of 3.75% with a face value
    of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2015. In
    March 2010, the Company issued and sold ten-year senior
    unsecured notes at an interest rate of 5.00% with a face value
    of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2020. The
    Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior
    unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general
    corporate purposes. As a result of these debt issuances, the
    Company’s weighted-average interest rates have increased in
    2010 due to higher rates paid on this fixed-rate debt.

The Company’s 2007 Credit Agreement expires in January
    2012. The total outstanding debt balance of the 2007 Credit
    Agreement at December 31, 2010 is $555 million. The
    Company anticipates refinancing this credit agreement at current
    market interest rates and terms customary to investment grade
    borrowers.

Product sales were $1,167 million and $1,052 million
    for 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of 11%. The
    increase in product sales in 2010 as compared to 2009 was
    primarily due to higher demand by the Company’s customers
    as a result of improved economic conditions and an increase in
    sales from the recently introduced ACQUITY UPLC H-Class, SYNAPT
    G-2 and Xevo Q-Tof instrument systems. Service sales were
    $477 million and $447 million in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, an increase of 7%. The increase in service sales
    in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to
    increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher
    installed base of customers.

Waters
    Division Net Sales

Waters Division sales increased 9% in 2010 as compared to 2009.
    Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on Waters
    Division sales in 2010.

Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based)
    increased 11% in 2010 and were primarily attributable to higher
    demand from the Company’s pharmaceutical, industrial,
    academic and government customers due to improvement in global
    economic conditions and the introduction of the new ACQUITY UPLC
    H-Class, SYNAPT G-2 and Xevo Q-Tof instrument systems. Chemistry
    consumables sales increased 9% in 2010 and were driven primarily
    by higher demand for chemistry consumable products,
    specifically, the ACQUITY UPLC columns. Waters Division service
    sales increased 6% in 2010 due to increased sales of service
    plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers.
    Waters Division sales by product line in both 2010 and 2009 were
    52% for instrument systems, 18% for chemistry consumables and
    30% for service.

Waters Division sales in Europe decreased 1% in 2010 and the
    effects of foreign currency translation decreased European sales
    by 3% in 2010. Waters Division sales in Asia increased 19% in
    2010, primarily due to strong sales growth in China and India.
    The effects of foreign currency translation increased sales in
    Asia by 4% in 2010. Waters Division sales in the U.S. and
    the rest of the world increased 8% and 13%, respectively. The
    effects of foreign currency translation increased 2010 sales in
    the rest of world by 3%.

TA
    Division Net Sales

TA’s sales were 17% higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. The
    increase was primarily a result of higher demand for instrument
    systems from TA’s industrial customers due to improved
    economic conditions. Foreign currency translation had minimal
    impact on TA’s 2010 sales as compared to 2009. Instrument
    system sales increased 19% in 2010 and represented 75% of sales
    in 2010 as compared to 74% in 2009. TA service sales increased
    11% in 2010 primarily due to increased sales of service plans
    and billings to a higher installed base of customers.
    Geographically, sales increased in each territory.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit for 2010 was $990 million compared to
    $904 million for 2009, an increase of 10%. Gross profit as
    a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 60.2% in 2010 as
    compared to 60.3% in 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars
    in 2010 was primarily attributed to higher sales volumes. During
    2010, as compared to 2009, the Company’s gross profit as a
    percentage of sales was slightly impacted by an unfavorable
    change in the sales mix and the unfavorable impact of movements
    in certain foreign exchange rates between the currencies where
    the Company manufactures products and the currencies where the
    sales were transacted, principally the Euro, Japanese Yen and
    British Pound. These declines in gross profit as a percentage of
    sales were mostly offset by the benefit of manufacturing product
    cost reductions and the benefit from manufacturing overhead
    absorption as a result of the increase in sales volume.

Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses for 2010 and 2009 were
    $445 million and $421 million, respectively, an
    increase of 6%. The increase in 2010 selling and administrative
    expenses includes merit, merit-related fringe benefit and
    incentive compensation increases. These increases were offset by
    the impact of the $6 million TA building lease



termination expense recorded in 2009 and an immaterial
    correction for certain incentive plan and other accrual balances
    recorded in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, selling and
    administrative expenses were 27.1% for 2010 compared to 28.1%
    for 2009.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $84 million and
    $77 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of
    9%. The increase in research and development expenses in 2010
    was primarily due to costs incurred on new products launched in
    2010.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were
    12.8% and 16.4%, respectively. Included in the 2010 income tax
    provision was an $8 million tax benefit related to the
    reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to an audit
    settlement in the United Kingdom and $2 million of tax
    benefit related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax
    exposure. These tax benefits decreased the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points in 2010.
    Included in the income tax provision for 2009 was a
    $5 million tax benefit related to the reversal of a
    $5 million provision that was originally recorded in 2008,
    relating to the reorganization of certain foreign legal
    entities. The recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a
    result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the
    U.S. Treasury in February 2009. This tax benefit decreased
    the Company’s effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage
    points in 2009. The remaining difference between the effective
    tax rates for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily
    attributable to higher pre-tax income in lower tax rate
    jurisdictions.

The Company’s effective tax rate is influenced by many
    significant factors including, but not limited to, the wide
    range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company
    operates; sales volumes and profit levels in each tax
    jurisdiction; changes in tax laws, tax rates and policies; and
    the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation. As
    a result of variability in these factors, the Company’s
    effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the
    effective tax rates reported for 2010 or 2009. A known factor
    that will increase the Company’s effective tax rate in the
    future is that the Company’s Ireland statutory tax rate
    will increase to 12.5% in 2011 from the historical contractual
    tax rate of 10%.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Net
    Sales

Product sales were $1,052 million and $1,140 million
    for 2009 and 2008, respectively, a decrease of 8%. The decrease
    in product sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due
    to the overall decline in Waters and TA instrument system sales
    due to lower spending by the Company’s customers as a
    result of the global economic recession and adverse effects from
    foreign currency translation. Service sales were
    $447 million and $435 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, an increase of 3%. The increase in service sales
    in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to
    increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher
    installed base of customers.

Waters
    Division Net Sales

Waters Division sales declined 4% in 2009 as compared to 2008.
    The effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted
    the Waters Division across all product lines, resulting in a
    decline in total sales of 2% in 2009. The 2009 acquisition of
    Thar and 2008 acquisition of Analytical Products Group, Inc.
    (“APG”) added 2% to sales in 2009.

Chemistry consumables sales in 2009 were comparable to 2008,
    with the effect of foreign currency translation negatively
    impacting chemistry consumable sales by 2%. Waters Division
    service sales grew 3% in 2009 due to increased sales of service
    plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The
    service sales growth rate was negatively impacted by 1% from the
    effect of foreign currency translation. Waters instrument system
    sales declined by 9% in 2009. The decrease in instrument system
    sales was primarily attributable to weak industrial and
    pharmaceutical customer spending caused by the global recession.
    The effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted
    2009 instrument system sales by 2%. Waters Division sales by
    product line in 2009 were 52% for instrument systems, 18% for
    chemistry consumables and 30% for service, as compared to 55%
    for instrument systems, 17% for chemistry consumables and 28%
    for service in 2008.



Waters Division sales in Europe declined 9% in 2009, primarily
    due to weak demand in Eastern Europe and the effects of foreign
    currency translation, which decreased 2009 sales in Europe by
    6%. Waters Division sales in Asia increased 2% in 2009, with
    strong sales growth in China partially offset by weakness in
    other Asian markets. The effects of foreign currency translation
    increased Asia’s 2009 sales by 2%. Waters Division sales in
    the U.S. and the rest of the world declined 2% and 13%,
    respectively. The effects of foreign currency translation
    decreased 2009 sales in the rest of world by 3%.

TA
    Division Net Sales

TA’s sales were 11% lower in 2009 as compared to the 2008
    primarily as a result of weak instrument system demand from its
    industrial customers. Foreign currency translation had minimal
    impact on TA’s 2009 sales as compared to 2008. The 2008
    acquisition of VTI added 1% to sales in 2009. Instrument system
    sales declined 15% in 2009 and represented 74% of sales in 2009
    as compared to 78% in 2008. TA service sales increased 4% in
    2009 due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher
    installed base of customers. Geographically, sales decreased in
    each territory.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit for 2009 was $904 million compared to
    $914 million for 2008, a decrease of 1%. Gross profit as a
    percentage of sales increased to 60.3% in 2009 as compared to
    58.0% in 2008. The decrease in gross profit dollars in 2009 was
    primarily attributed to lower sales volume and lower prices in
    certain geographies offset by benefits from net favorable
    foreign currency translation, a favorable change in sales mix
    and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit in 2008 also had a
    $9 million charge from

out-of-period

adjustments related to capitalized software amortization. During
    2009, as compared to 2008, the Company’s gross profit as a
    percentage of sales benefited from favorable movements in
    certain foreign exchange rates between currencies where the
    Company manufactures and services products and currencies where
    the sales were transacted, principally the Euro, Japanese Yen
    and British Pound. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was
    also primarily impacted by the change in sales mix, with 2009
    including a higher level of higher margin chemistry consumables
    and service sales than 2008.

Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses for 2009 and 2008 were
    $421 million and $427 million, respectively, a
    decrease of 1%. The decrease in 2009 selling and administrative
    expenses was primarily due to tighter control of discretionary
    spending, including no merit increase in 2009, lower incentive
    compensation and the comparative favorable impact of foreign
    currency translation. The 2009 decreases were offset by the
    impact of the $6 million expense incurred in connection
    with the TA lease termination payment. As a percentage of net
    sales, selling and administrative expenses were 28.1% for 2009
    compared to 27.1% for 2008. This increase can be attributed to
    lower 2009 sales volumes.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $77 million and
    $82 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively, a decrease of
    5%. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2009
    was primarily due to the comparative favorable impact of foreign
    currency translation.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $11 million and $39 million for
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in
    2009 was primarily attributable to a decrease in average
    borrowings, as well as significantly lower interest rates during
    2009 as compared to 2008.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $3 million and $21 million for
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest income is
    primarily due to significantly lower yields during 2009 as
    compared to 2008, as well as lower average cash and short-term
    investment balances.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were
    16.4% and 13.4%, respectively. Included in the income tax
    provision for 2009 was a $5 million tax benefit relating to
    the reversal of a $5 million provision that was



originally recorded in 2008, related to the reorganization of
    certain foreign legal entities. The recognition of this tax
    benefit in 2009 was a result of changes in income tax
    regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury in February
    2009. The tax benefit in 2009 decreased the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2009. The
    one-time tax provision in 2008 increased the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points in 2008. In
    addition, the effective tax rate for 2008 included a
    $16 million benefit resulting from

out-of-period

adjustments related to software capitalization amortization. The

out-of-period

adjustments had the effect of reducing the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points in 2008. The
    remaining difference between the effective tax rates for 2009 as
    compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to differences in
    pre-tax income in jurisdictions with different effective tax
    rates.

Cash Flow
    from Operating Activities

Year
    Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2009

Net cash provided by operating activities was $458 million
    and $418 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    changes within net cash provided by operating activities in 2010
    as compared to 2009 include the following significant changes in
    the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating
    activities, aside from the increase in net income:

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2010 compared to 2009 was
    primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers
    and higher sales volumes in 2010 as compared to 2009.
    Days-sales-outstanding (“DSO”) was 67 days at
    both December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

•

The 2010 change in inventories was attributed to the increase in
    inventory related to the ramp up in sales of new products
    launched in the second half of 2010 and to be launched in early
    2011.

•

The 2010 change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities was impacted by a higher accounts payable balance,
    higher incentive compensation accruals and higher accrued
    interest balances, while the 2009 change was impacted by a
    $6 million litigation payment and a $6 million TA
    building lease termination payment. In addition, accounts
    payable and other current liabilities changed as a result of
    timing of payments to vendors.



•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in
    both 2010 and 2009 was a result of the installed base of
    customers renewing annual service contracts.

•

Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of
    various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current
    assets, other assets and other liabilities.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million
    in both 2009 and 2008. The changes within net cash provided by
    operating activities in 2009 as compared to 2008 include the
    following significant changes in the sources and uses of net
    cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase
    in net income:

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2009 compared to 2008 was
    primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers
    and the lower sales volumes in 2009 as compared to 2008. DSO
    increased to 67 days at December 31, 2009 from
    63 days at December 31, 2008.

•

The change in inventories in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily
    attributable to the decrease in sales volume.

•

The 2009 change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities includes a $6 million litigation payment, which
    was accrued in 2008. In 2009, the Company also made a
    $6 million payment to terminate the lease on the old TA
    facility. In addition, accounts payable and other current
    liabilities changed as a result of timing of payments to vendors
    and lower incentive compensation accruals.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in
    both 2009 and 2008 was a result of the installed base of
    customers renewing annual service contracts.

•

Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of
    various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current
    assets, other assets and other liabilities.

Cash Used
    in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $412 million
    and $419 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net cash
    provided by investing activities totaled $19 million in
    2008. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were
    $63 million, $94 million and $69 million in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital spending was higher in 2009
    due to the acquisition of land and construction of a new TA
    facility, which was completed in 2009. In 2010, the Company
    entered into an agreement to purchase land (subject to local
    regulatory approval) in the United Kingdom to construct a new
    facility, which will consolidate certain existing primary
    manufacturing locations. The Company spent $3 million in
    2010 in relation to this new facility and expects to incur
    capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of
    $70 million to $90 million to construct this facility.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company purchased
    $1,235 million, $518 million and $20 million of
    short-term investments, respectively, while $886 million,
    $229 million and $115 million of short-term
    investments matured, respectively. Business acquisitions, net of
    cash acquired, were $36 million and $8 million during
    2009 and 2008, respectively. There were no business acquisitions
    in 2010.

Cash Used
    in Financing Activities

In February 2010, the Company issued and sold five-year senior
    unsecured notes at an interest rate of 3.75% with a face value
    of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2015. In
    March 2010, the Company issued and sold ten-year senior
    unsecured notes at an interest rate of 5.00% with a face value
    of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2020. The
    Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior
    unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general
    corporate purposes. Interest on both issuances of senior
    unsecured notes is payable semi-annually in February and August
    of each year. The Company may redeem some of the notes at any
    time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal
    amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the
    applicable make-whole amount. These notes require that the
    Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less
    than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1
    for any period of four consecutive fiscal



quarters, respectively. In addition, these notes include
    customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants,
    representations and warranties and events of default.

In March 2008, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the
    “2008 Credit Agreement”) that provided for a
    $150 million term loan facility. In October 2008, the
    Company utilized cash balances associated with the effective
    liquidation of certain foreign legal entities into the
    U.S. to voluntarily prepay the $150 million term loan
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement. The repayment of the term loan
    effectively terminated all lending arrangements under the 2008
    Credit Agreement.

In January 2007, the Company entered into a credit agreement
    (the “2007 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a
    $500 million term loan facility and $600 million in
    revolving facilities, which include both a letter of credit and
    a swingline subfacility. The 2007 Credit Agreement matures on
    January 11, 2012 and requires no scheduled prepayments
    before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2007
    Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to
    either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or
    the federal funds rate plus


/


%)
    or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in
    each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the
    Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between
    33 basis points and 72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate
    loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis
    points for base rate loans. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires
    that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of
    not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than
    3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters,
    respectively. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes
    negative covenants that are customary for investment-grade
    credit facilities and customary representations and warranties,
    affirmative covenants and events of default. The Company uses
    the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs.

During 2010 and 2009, the Company’s net debt borrowings
    increased by $134 million and $92 million,
    respectively. During 2008, the Company’s net debt
    borrowings decreased $348 million. As of December 31,
    2010, the Company had $200 million in outstanding notes,
    $500 million borrowed under a term loan facility,
    $55 million borrowed under revolving credit facilities and
    $11 million borrowed under various other short-term lines
    of credit. The outstanding portions of the revolving facilities
    have been classified as short-term liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets due to the fact that the Company
    utilizes the revolving line of credit to fund its working
    capital needs. It is the Company’s intention to pay the
    outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the
    subsequent twelve months following the respective period end
    date; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to
    do so. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a total
    amount available to borrow under existing credit agreements of
    $543 million after outstanding letters of credit.

In 2011, the Company anticipates refinancing its 2007 Credit
    Agreement, which expires in January 2012, at market interest
    rates and terms customary to investment-grade borrowers, but
    there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so on such
    terms. The total outstanding debt balance of the 2007 Credit
    Agreement at December 31, 2010 is $555 million and, in
    January 2011, the outstanding $500 million borrowed under
    the term loan facility will become a current liability.

In February 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of
    its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company had purchased an aggregate
    of 7.5 million shares at a cost of $449 million under
    the February 2009 program, leaving $51 million authorized
    for future repurchases. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    repurchased 4.4 million, 4.5 million and
    4.1 million shares at a cost of $292 million,
    $210 million and $235 million, respectively, under the
    February 2009 authorization and previously announced programs.
    In February 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional
    $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a
    two-year period.

The Company received $101 million, $19 million and
    $29 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options
    and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s
    employee stock purchase plan in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

The Company believes that the cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments of $946 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and expected cash flow from operating
    activities, together with borrowing capacity from committed
    credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund
    working capital and capital spending



requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts, potential
    acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing
    litigation for at least the next twelve months. Management
    believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial
    position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings
    based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from
    external sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating
    and investing needs for the foreseeable future.

The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are,
    at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate
    (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate
    plus


/


%)
    or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in
    each case plus a credit margin based upon the Company’s
    leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and
    72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate loans and range between
    zero basis points and 37.5 basis points for base rate
    loans. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company
    comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than
    3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any
    period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In
    addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants
    that are customary for investment grade credit facilities and
    customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants
    and events of default. As of December 31, 2010, the Company
    was in compliance with all such covenants.

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third
    parties, which expire at various dates through 2011. Fees paid
    for licenses were less than $1 million in each of the years
    2010, 2009 and 2008. Future minimum license fees payable under
    existing license agreements as of December 31, 2010 are
    immaterial.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
    in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
    business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
    its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
    individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.
    Current litigation is described in Item 3, Legal
    Proceedings, of Part I of this

Form 10-K.

The Company has long-term liabilities for deferred employee
    compensation, including pension and supplemental executive
    retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental
    retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent
    upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether
    the employee elects lump-sum or annuity payments. During fiscal
    year 2011, the Company expects to contribute approximately
    $3 million to $5 million to the Company’s defined
    benefit plans.

In order to accommodate future sales growth, the Company has
    been authorized by the Board of Directors to develop and
    implement a plan to consolidate certain primary manufacturing
    locations in the United Kingdom into one facility. The Company
    expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in
    the range of $70 million to



$90 million to construct this facility. The Company
    believes it can fund the construction of this facility with cash
    flows from operating activities and its borrowing capacity from
    committed credit facilities.

The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting
    positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting
    standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the
    expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return
    reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax
    authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting
    positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but prohibits any discounting of any of the
    related tax effects for the time value of money. If all of the
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of
    December 31, 2010 were to become recognizable in the
    future, the Company would record a total reduction of
    approximately $72 million in its income tax provision. The
    Company’s uncertain tax positions are taken with respect to
    income tax return reporting periods beginning after
    December 31, 1999, which are the periods that generally
    remain open to income tax audit examination by the concerned
    income tax authorities. The Company continuously monitors the
    lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments
    for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax
    benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax
    assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2010, the
    Company does not expect to record any material changes in the
    measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest
    and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the
    settlement of tax audit examinations or to the lapsing of
    statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments within the
    next twelve months.

The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay
    any dividends in the foreseeable future.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Company has not created, and is not party to, any
    special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of
    raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its
    business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the
    Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated
    financial statements. The Company has not entered into any
    transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has
    subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other
    contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material
    continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation
    under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that
    provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk
    support to the Company.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in
    its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements,
    the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse
    the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
    indemnified party, generally the Company’s business
    partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or
    other intellectual property infringement claims by any third
    party with respect to its current products, as well as claims
    relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from
    the performance of services by the Company or its
    subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments
    the Company could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the
    Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
    relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and
    management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of
    these agreements is immaterial.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Summary

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires
    the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
    and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical
    accounting policies are those that are central to the
    presentation of the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations that require management to make estimates
    about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a
    material impact on the Company’s results of operations
    given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to
    occur from period to period or use of different estimates that
    reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an
    ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates.
    The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
    various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the
    Company’s consolidated



financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed
    critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these
    and other items could potentially have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
    product shipment and performance of service, respectively. The
    Company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance
    sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service
    contracts and customer payments received in advance and prior to
    shipment of the instrument. At December 31, 2010, the
    Company had current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities
    of $106 million and $18 million, respectively. Revenue
    is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition
    criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
    delivery has occurred; the vendor’s fee is fixed or
    determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if
    applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with
    contractual cash holdback are specified. Shipping and handling
    costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to
    the customer per the order.

Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
    evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
    until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
    specifying fixed terms and prices. The Company recognizes
    product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of
    loss passes to the customer. The Company structures its sales
    arrangements as FOB shipping point or international equivalent
    and, accordingly, recognizes revenue upon shipment. In some
    cases, FOB destination based shipping terms are included in
    sales arrangements, in which cases revenue is recognized when
    the products arrive at the customer site.

The Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain
    products requiring installation is in accordance with multiple
    element revenue recognition accounting standards. With respect
    to the installation obligations, the larger of the contractual
    cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is
    deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized
    as a multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete.
    The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon
    a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates,
    estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged
    by third parties.

Instrument service contracts are typically billed at the
    beginning of the maintenance period. The amount of the service
    contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument
    maintenance period. There are no deferred costs associated with
    the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when
    the service is performed. No revenue is recognized until all
    revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the
    accounting standards for software revenue recognition. The
    Company’s software arrangements typically include software
    licenses and maintenance contracts. Software license revenue is
    recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable,
    collection is probable, and there are no significant
    post-delivery obligations remaining. The revenue associated with
    the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the
    maintenance term. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are
    typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when and
    if available basis. The Company uses the residual method to
    allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple
    elements and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair
    value of undelivered elements exists. Under the residual method,
    the fair value of the undelivered element (maintenance) is
    deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is
    allocated to the delivered element (software license) and is
    recognized as revenue.

Loss
    Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
    to make required payments. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
    impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
    allowances may be required. The Company does not request
    collateral from its customers, but collectibility is enhanced
    through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit.
    The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of
    factors, including, but not limited to, past transaction history
    with the customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer,
    industry trends and the macro-economic environment.
    Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad
    debt losses. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of
    future product returns related to current period revenue.
    Material differences may



result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if
    management made different judgments or utilized different
    estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful
    accounts. The Company’s accounts receivable balance at
    December 31, 2010 was $358 million, net of allowances
    for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $6 million.

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
    or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis (“FIFO”). The Company estimates
    revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical
    obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand,
    including that in the Company’s current backlog of orders,
    and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or
    market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional write-downs may be required. The
    Company’s inventory balance at December 31, 2010 was
    $204 million, net of write-downs to net realizable value of
    $15 million.

Long-Lived
    Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles,
    long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could
    trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to,
    the following:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
    projected future operating results;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends; and,

•

significant changes or developments in strategic technological
    collaborations or legal matters which affect the Company’s
    capitalized patents, trademarks and intellectual properties,
    such as licenses.

When the Company determines that the carrying value of an
    individual intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill may
    not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of
    the above indicators, an estimate of undiscounted future cash
    flows produced by that intangible asset, long-lived asset or
    goodwill, including its eventual residual value, is compared to
    the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In
    the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient
    to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is
    written-down to its estimated fair value. Net intangible assets,
    long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $181 million,
    $215 million and $292 million, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2010.

The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill
    on January 1 of each year. For goodwill impairment review
    purposes, the Company has two reporting units, the Waters
    Division and TA. The Company currently does not expect to record
    an impairment charge in the foreseeable future; however, there
    can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are
    completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded.
    The factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment
    charge in the future include, but are not limited to, the
    following:

•

a significant decline in the Company’s projected revenue,
    earnings or cash flows;

•

a significant adverse change in legal factors or business
    climate;

•

a significant decline in the Company’s stock price or the
    stock price of comparable companies;

•

an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and,

•

unanticipated competition.

Warranty

Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
    engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
    including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its
    component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is
    affected by product failure rates, material usage and service
    delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should
    actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery
    costs differ from the Company’s previous estimates,
    revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
    At December 31, 2010, the Company’s warranty liability
    was $11 million.



Income
    Taxes

As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes
    in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process
    involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure
    together with assessing changes in temporary differences
    resulting from differing treatment of items, such as
    depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and
    accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
    assets and liabilities, which are included within the
    consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results
    differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these
    estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish
    an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact
    its financial position and results of operations.

The accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company
    continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a
    valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, depending on
    whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those
    assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the
    Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting
    positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting
    standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the
    expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return
    reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax
    authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting
    positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the
    related tax effects for the time value of money. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company had unrecognized tax
    benefits of $72 million.

Litigation

As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I
    of this

Form 10-K,

the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters.
    With respect to each pending claim, management determines
    whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable
    and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when
    management has determined, with respect to a particular claim,
    both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate
    the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to
    either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in
    that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose
    additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to
    considerable interpretation.

With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management
    of the Company to date has been able to make this determination
    and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims
    described in Item 3. As developments occur in these matters
    and additional information becomes available, management of the
    Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their
    range, which may result in its recording charges or additional
    charges which could materially impact the Company’s results
    of operations or financial position.

Pension
    and Other Retirement Benefits

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
    and the fair values of plan assets for the Company’s
    pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated
    periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on
    relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the
    discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated
    and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the
    weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets will be 6.86% for its U.S. benefit plans and 3.07%
    for its

Non-U.S. benefit

plans.

At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount
    rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined
    the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and
    Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments
    and the Moody’s Aa interest rate as of December 31,
    2010 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash
    flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once
    the interest rates were determined, the plan’s cash flow
    was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement
    date. At December 31, 2010, the Company determined the
    weighted-average discount rate to be 5.31% for the
    U.S. benefit plans and 3.63% for the

non-U.S. benefits

plans.

A one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate
    would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for
    the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A
    one-quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long-term
    rate of return would decrease the Company’s net periodic
    benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than
    $1 million.



Stock-based
    Compensation

The accounting standard for stock-based compensation requires
    that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the
    statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company
    has used the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of
    its stock option awards. Under the fair-value recognition
    provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is
    measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and
    is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining
    the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires
    judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and
    employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results
    differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based
    compensation expense and the Company’s results of
    operations could be materially impacted. As stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements
    of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to
    vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated
    forfeitures. This accounting standard requires forfeitures to be
    estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
    subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical
    experience. If factors change and the Company employs different
    assumptions in the application of this accounting standard, the
    compensation expense that the Company records in future periods
    may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in
    the current period.

The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method
    permitted under the stock-based compensation accounting standard
    and, consequently, has not adjusted results from prior years.
    Under the modified transition method, compensation costs now
    include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards
    granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense related
    to any awards issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The
    Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line
    attribution method.

As of December 31, 2010, unrecognized compensation costs
    and related weighted-average lives over which the costs will be
    amortized were as follows (in millions):

Recent
    Accounting Standard Changes and Developments

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Standards

In June 2009, a new accounting standard was issued relating to
    the consolidation of variable interest entities. This statement
    addresses (1) the effects on certain provisions of existing
    accounting standards as a result of the elimination of the
    qualifying special-purpose entity concept and
    (2) constituent concerns about the application of certain
    key provisions of existing accounting standards, including those
    in which the accounting and disclosures under existing
    accounting standards do not always provide timely and useful
    information about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable
    interest entity. This standard is effective for periods
    beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this
    standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2010, the Company adopted a newly issued accounting
    standard which requires additional disclosure about the amounts
    of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of
    Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value measurements. This
    standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements related
    to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for
    each class of assets and liabilities and disclosure about inputs
    and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both
    recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and Level 3
    measurements. As this newly issued accounting standard only
    requires enhanced disclosure, the adoption of this standard did
    not impact the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations. In addition, effective for interim and annual
    periods beginning after December 15, 2010, this standard
    will require additional disclosure and require an entity to
    present disaggregated information about activity in Level 3
    fair-value measurements on a gross basis, rather than as one net
    amount.



Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

In October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for
    multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This consensus amends
    existing revenue recognition accounting standards. This
    consensus provides accounting principles and application
    guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the
    arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated.
    This guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair
    value of undelivered products and services and instead provides
    for separate revenue recognition based upon management’s
    estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there
    is no other means to determine the fair value of that
    undelivered item. Previously, the existing accounting consensus
    required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the
    price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between
    unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when
    the item is sold separately by the vendor. Under the existing
    accounting consensus, if the fair value of all of the elements
    in the arrangement was not determinable, then revenue was
    deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was
    determined. This new approach is effective prospectively for
    revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The
    adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Also in October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for
    certain revenue arrangements that include software elements.
    This consensus amends the existing accounting guidance for
    revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and
    software. This consensus requires that tangible products which
    contain software components and non-software components that
    function together to deliver the tangible products essential
    functionality are no longer within the scope of the software
    revenue guidance. This new approach is effective prospectively
    for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The
    adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its
    exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes
    other than trading, in accordance with the Company’s
    overall risk management guidelines.

The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange-rate risk
    with respect to certain inter-company balances, forecasted
    transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro,
    Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The Company
    manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis,
    which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take
    into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In
    addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non-derivative
    financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to
    currency fluctuations.

The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and
    cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
    interest rates. The Company’s policy is to manage interest
    costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that
    management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix
    in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered
    into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to
    exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed
    and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an
    agreed upon notional amount.

Hedge
    Transactions

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with
    the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging
    activities, which establishes the accounting and reporting
    standards for derivative instruments, including certain
    derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
    hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in
    hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the
    consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or
    liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value
    hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of
    the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized
    in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow
    hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of
    the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and
    are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects
    earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are
    recognized in earnings. In addition, disclosures required for



derivative instruments and hedging activities include the
    Company’s objectives for using derivative instruments, the
    level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as
    how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the
    Company’s financial position and performance.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage
    exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The
    Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to
    minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most
    effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign
    currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and
    links all derivatives designated as fair-value, cash flow or net
    investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
    consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted
    transactions. In addition, the Company considers the impact of
    its counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the
    contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under
    the contracts. The Company also assesses and documents, both at
    the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
    effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows
    associated with the hedged items.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
    to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
    related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In
    August 2007, the Company entered into two

floating-to-fixed-rate

interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of
    $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October
    2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan
    facility of its outstanding debt. At both December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap
    agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company recorded a change of $2 million in accumulated
    other comprehensive income on the interest rate agreements. For
    the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded a
    cumulative net pre-tax unrealized loss of $1 million in
    accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest rate
    agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    the Company recorded additional interest expense of
    $2 million and $1 million, respectively.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
    principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain inter-company balances and short-term assets and
    liabilities. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro,
    Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The periods of
    these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
    and have varying notional amounts, which are intended to be
    consistent with changes in the underlying exposures. Gains and
    losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
    administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
    operations. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional
    amounts totaling $136 million, $138 million and
    $120 million, respectively. At both December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Company had assets of less than $1 million in
    other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets related
    to the foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the Company had liabilities of $1 million
    and less than $1 million, respectively, in other current
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets related to the
    foreign currency exchange contracts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax losses of $8 million, which consist of realized
    losses of $8 million relating to the closed forward
    contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $7 million, which consist of realized gains of
    $5 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $2 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward
    contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
    $23 million, which consist of realized losses of
    $22 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end
    exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the
    fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of
    December 31, 2010 would decrease pre-tax earnings by
    approximately $14 million.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations
    from the investments of cash generated from operations. The
    Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less,
    primarily in bank deposits, and AAA rated U.S. treasury and
    European government bond money market



funds. Investments with longer maturities are classified as
    short-term investments, and are held primarily in bank deposits
    and U.S., German, French and Dutch government treasury bills.
    Cash equivalents and short-term investments are convertible to a
    known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change
    in market value. The Company maintains balances in various
    operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in
    foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than
    U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has
    no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper
    issued by structured investment vehicles, collateralized debt
    obligation conduits or asset-backed conduits.

The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk
    due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of
    December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the Company’s
    cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value.



Item 8:

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
    detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our
    evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

, our management,
    including our chief executive officer and chief financial
    officer, concluded that our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
    herein.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and of cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
    statements the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for business combinations effective January 1, 2009.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  Description
    of Business and Organization

Waters Corporation
    (“Waters

®

”

    or the “Company”), an analytical instrument
    manufacturer, primarily designs, manufactures, sells and
    services, through its Waters Division, high performance liquid
    chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid
    chromatography
    (“UPLC

®

”

    and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass
    spectrometry (“MS”) instrument systems and support
    products, including chromatography columns, other consumable
    products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These
    systems are complementary products that can be integrated
    together and used along with other analytical instruments. LC is
    a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of
    industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the
    chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and
    to purify a full range of compounds. MS instruments are used in
    drug discovery and development, including clinical trial
    testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as
    “proteomics”), food safety analysis and environmental
    testing. LC is often combined with MS to create LC-MS
    instruments that include a liquid phase sample introduction and
    separation system with mass spectrometric compound
    identification and quantification. Through its TA Division
    (“TA

®

”),

    the Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services
    thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments, which
    are used in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals,
    polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer
    goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science
    research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of
    software-based products that interface with the Company’s
    instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of
    the instrument system.

2  Basis
    of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and
    judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company
    evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
    recognition, product returns and allowances, bad debts,
    inventory valuation, equity investments, goodwill and intangible
    assets, warranty and installation provisions, income taxes,
    contingencies, litigation, retirement plan obligations and
    stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on
    historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
    believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
    of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Risks and
    Uncertainties

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the
    analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to,
    global economic and financial market conditions, development by
    its competitors of new technological innovations, risk of
    disruption, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
    dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of
    proprietary technology, compliance with regulations of the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign
    regulatory authorities and agencies and changes in the fair
    value of the underlying assets of the Company’s defined
    benefit plans.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly
    owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or
    controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All
    material inter-company balances and transactions have been
    eliminated.

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and
    liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange
    rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and
    expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing
    during the period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are
    included in accumulated other



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. The
    Company’s net sales derived from operations outside the
    United States were 70% in 2010, 69% in 2009 and 70% in 2008.
    Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included
    in net income in the consolidated statements of operations and
    were not material for the years presented.

Seasonality
    of Business

The Company experiences an increase in sales in the fourth
    quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of
    customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by
    calendar year end.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents primarily represent highly liquid investments,
    with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in
    bank deposits, and AAA rated U.S. treasury and European
    government bond money market funds, which are convertible to a
    known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change
    in market value. Investments with longer maturities are
    classified as short-term investments, and are held primarily in
    bank deposits and U.S., German, French and Dutch government
    treasury bills. The Company maintains balances in various
    operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in
    foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than
    U.S. dollars.

Short-Term
    Investments

Short-term investments are classified as

available-for-sale

in accordance with the accounting standard for investments in
    debt and equity securities. All

available-for-sale

securities are recorded at fair market value and any unrealized
    holding gains and losses, to the extent deemed temporary, are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
    stockholders’ equity, net of the related tax effects.
    Realized gains and losses are determined on the specific
    identification method and are included in other income (expense)
    net. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the
    value of the investment, the Company considers all available
    evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is
    “other than temporary” and marks the investment to
    market through a charge to the statement of operations. The
    Company classifies its investments as short-term investments
    exclusive of those categorized as cash equivalents. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had short-term
    investments with a cost of $638 million and
    $289 million, respectively, which approximated market value.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
    the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the
    existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number
    of factors, including historical experience and the
    customer’s credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful
    accounts is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. Past due
    balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are
    reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are
    charged against the allowance when the Company feels it is
    probable that the receivable will not be recovered. The Company
    does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to
    its customers.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s
    allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products and services to a significant
    number of large and small customers throughout the world, with
    net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately 52% in
    2010, 51% in 2009 and 50% in 2008. None of the Company’s
    individual customers accounted for more than 3% of annual
    Company sales in 2010, 2009 or 2008. The Company performs
    continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
    does not require collateral, but in certain circumstances may
    require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company
    has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

Inventory

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
    or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis (“FIFO”).

Income
    Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences
    between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets
    and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which
    the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance
    is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon
    the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or
    all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A liability
    has also been recorded to recognize uncertain tax return
    reporting positions.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures
    for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, while the
    costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation
    is provided using the straight-line method over the following
    estimated useful lives: buildings — fifteen to thirty
    years; building improvements — five to ten years;
    leasehold improvements — the shorter of the economic
    useful life or life of lease; and production and other
    equipment — three to ten years. Upon retirement or
    sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related
    accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated
    balance sheets and related gains or losses are reflected in the
    consolidated statements of operations. There were no material
    gains or losses from retirement or sale of assets in 2010, 2009
    and 2008.

Asset
    Impairments

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
    accordance with the accounting standard for property, plant and
    equipment. Whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company
    evaluates the fair value of the asset, relying on a number of
    factors, including, but not limited to, operating results,
    business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash
    flows. Any change in the carrying amount of an asset as a result
    of the Company’s evaluation is separately identified in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests for goodwill impairment using a fair-value
    approach at the reporting unit level annually, or earlier, if an
    event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
    not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
    amount. Additionally, the Company performs an annual goodwill
    impairment assessment for its reporting units as of January 1
    each year. The goodwill and other intangible assets accounting
    standard defines a reporting unit as an operating segment, or
    one level below an operating segment, if discrete financial
    information is prepared and reviewed by management. For goodwill
    impairment review purposes, the Company has two reporting units,
    the Waters Division and TA. Goodwill is allocated to the
    reporting units at the time of acquisition. Under the impairment
    test, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its
    estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is recognized to the
    extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied
    fair value of the goodwill. The fair value of reporting units
    was estimated using a discounted cash flows technique, which



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

includes certain management assumptions, such as estimated
    future cash flows, estimated growth rates and discount rates.

The Company’s intangible assets include purchased
    technology; capitalized software development costs; costs
    associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and
    intellectual properties, such as licenses; debt issuance costs
    and acquired in-process research and development
    (“IPR&D”). Purchased intangibles are recorded at
    their fair market values as of the acquisition date and
    amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to
    fifteen years. Other intangibles are amortized over a period
    ranging from one to thirteen years. Debt issuance costs are
    amortized over the life of the related debt. Acquired IPR&D
    is amortized from the date of completion over its estimated
    useful life. In addition, acquired IPR&D will be tested for
    impairment until completion of the acquired programs.

Software
    Development Costs

The Company capitalizes software development costs for products
    offered for sale in accordance with the accounting standard for
    the costs of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.
    Capitalized costs are amortized to cost of sales over the period
    of economic benefit, which approximates a straight-line basis
    over the estimated useful lives of the related software
    products, generally three to five years.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs in
    accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other
    intangible assets. Capitalized internal software development
    costs are amortized over the period of economic benefit which
    approximates a straight-line basis over ten years. Net
    capitalized internal software included in property, plant and
    equipment totaled $4 million and $2 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Investments

The Company accounts for its investments that represent less
    than twenty percent ownership, and for which the Company does
    not have significant influence, using the accounting standard
    for investments in debt and equity securities. Investments for
    which the Company does not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence, and for which there is not a readily
    determinable market value, are accounted for under the cost
    method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates the
    carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost
    method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost or
    estimated net realizable value. For investments in which the
    Company owns or controls between twenty and forty-nine percent
    of the voting shares, or over which it exerts significant
    influence over operating and financial policies, the equity
    method of accounting is used. The Company’s share of net
    income or losses of equity investments is included in the
    consolidated statements of operations and was not material in
    any period presented. All investments at December 31, 2010
    and 2009 are included in other assets and amounted to
    $4 million for both years.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value
    measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s
    assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring
    basis as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Fair values
    determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such
    as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by
    Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices
    in active markets that are observable either directly or
    indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs
    utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no
    market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its
    own assumptions.

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities have been
    classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have
    been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently
    valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The
    pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including
    reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads,
    broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and
    economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by
    third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods
    and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. The fair
    values of the Company’s cash equivalents, short-term
    investments, retirement restoration plan assets and foreign
    currency exchange contracts are determined through market and
    observable sources and have been classified as Level 2.
    After completing these validation procedures,



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Company did not adjust or override any fair value
    measurements provided by third-party pricing services as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

In January 2009, the Company implemented the accounting and
    disclosure requirements related to non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring
    basis. The adoption of this accounting and disclosure
    requirement did not have a significant impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Fair
    Value of Other Financial Instruments

The Company’s cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable
    and debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.
    The carrying value and fair value of the Company’s fixed
    interest rate debt is $200 million and $203 million,
    respectively, at December 31, 2010.

Hedge
    Transactions

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates and interest rates.

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with
    the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging
    activities, which establishes the accounting and reporting
    standards for derivative instruments, including certain
    derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
    hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in
    hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the
    consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or
    liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value
    hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of
    the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized
    in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow
    hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of
    the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and
    are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects
    earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are
    recognized in earnings. In addition, disclosures required for
    derivative instruments and hedging activities include the
    Company’s objectives for using derivative instruments, the
    level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as
    how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the
    Company’s financial position and performance.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage
    exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The
    Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to
    minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most
    effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign
    currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and
    links all derivatives designated as fair-value, cash flow or net
    investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
    consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted
    transactions. In addition, the Company considers the impact of
    its counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the
    contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under
    the contracts. The Company also assesses and documents, both at
    the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
    effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows
    associated with the hedged items.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
    to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
    related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In
    August 2007, the Company entered into two

floating-to-fixed-rate

interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of
    $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October
    2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan
    facility of its outstanding debt. At both December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap
    agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company recorded a change of $2 million in accumulated
    other comprehensive income on the interest rate agreements. For
    the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded a
    cumulative net pre-tax unrealized loss of $1 million in
    accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest rate
    agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    the Company recorded additional interest expense of
    $2 million and $1 million, respectively.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
    principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain inter-company balances and short-term assets and
    liabilities. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro,
    Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The periods of
    these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
    and have varying notional amounts, which are intended to be
    consistent with changes in the underlying exposures. Gains and
    losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
    administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
    operations. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional
    amounts totaling $136 million, $138 million and
    $120 million, respectively. At both December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Company had assets of less than $1 million in
    other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets related
    to the foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the Company had liabilities of $1 million
    and less than $1 million, respectively, in other current
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets related to the
    foreign currency exchange contracts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax losses of $8 million, which consist of realized
    losses of $8 million relating to the closed forward
    contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $7 million, which consist of realized gains of
    $5 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $2 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward
    contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
    $23 million, which consist of realized losses of
    $22 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts.

Stockholders’
    Equity

In February 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of
    its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During 2010
    and 2009, the Company repurchased 4.4 million and
    3.1 million shares at a cost of $292 million and
    $157 million, respectively, under this program, leaving
    $51 million authorized for future purchases.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company repurchased
    4.4 million, 4.5 million and 4.1 million shares
    at a cost of $292 million, $210 million and
    $235 million, respectively, under the February 2009
    authorization and previously announced programs. In February
    2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
    Company to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of
    its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. The Company
    believes it has the resources to fund the common stock
    repurchases as well as to pursue acquisition opportunities in
    the future.

On August 9, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the
    adoption of a stock purchase rights plan where a dividend of one
    fractional preferred share purchase right (a “Right”)
    was declared for each outstanding share of common stock, par
    value $0.01 per share, of the Company. The dividend was paid on
    August 27, 2002 to the stockholders of record on that date.
    The Rights, which expire on August 27, 2012, become
    exercisable only under certain conditions. When they first
    become exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to buy
    from Waters one one-hundredth of a share of new Series A
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock (authorized limit of 4,000)
    for $120.00. When a person or group actually has acquired 15% or
    more of Waters’ common stock, the Rights will then become
    exercisable for a number of shares of Waters’ common stock
    with a market value of twice the $120.00 exercise price of each
    Right. In addition, the Rights will then become exercisable for
    a number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company with
    a market value of twice the $120.00 exercise price per Right.
    The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at a price of
    $0.001 per Right up until 10 days following a public
    announcement that any person or group has acquired 15% or more
    of the Company’s common stock.

Revenue
    Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
    product shipment and performance of service, respectively. The
    Company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance
    sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service
    contracts and customer payments received in advance prior to
    shipment of the instrument. Revenue is recognized when all of
    the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive
    evidence of an



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendor’s fee
    is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured
    and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria
    with contractual cash holdback are specified. Shipping and
    handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts
    invoiced to the customer per the order.

Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
    evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
    until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
    specifying fixed terms and prices. The Company recognizes
    product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of
    loss passes to the customer. The Company structures its sales
    arrangements as FOB shipping point or international equivalent
    and, accordingly, recognizes revenue upon shipment. In some
    cases, FOB destination based shipping terms are included in
    sales arrangements, in which cases revenue is recognized when
    the products arrive at the customer site.

The Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain
    products requiring installation is in accordance with the
    multiple element revenue recognition accounting standards. With
    respect to the installation obligations, the larger of the
    contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation
    service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is
    recognized as a multiple-element arrangement when installation
    is complete. The Company determines the fair value of
    installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly
    service billing rates, estimated installation hours and
    comparisons of amounts charged by third parties.

Instrument service contracts are typically billed at the
    beginning of the maintenance period. The amount of the service
    contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument
    maintenance period. There are no deferred costs associated with
    the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when
    the service is performed. No revenue is recognized until all
    revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the
    accounting standards for software revenue recognition. The
    Company’s software arrangements typically include software
    licenses and maintenance contracts. Software license revenue is
    recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable,
    collection is probable, and there are no significant
    post-delivery obligations remaining. The revenue associated with
    the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the
    maintenance term. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are
    typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a

when-and-if-available

basis. The Company uses the residual method to allocate software
    revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor
    specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered
    elements exists. Under the residual method, the fair value of
    the undelivered element (maintenance) is deferred and the
    remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the
    delivered element (software license) and recognized as revenue.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales
    arrangements. Revenue associated with products that contain
    specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized before
    the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. Discounts from
    list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales.

Product
    Warranty Costs

The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time
    of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated
    statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive
    product quality programs and processes, including actively
    monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies,
    the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product
    failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs
    incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the
    accrued warranty liability is based on historical information,
    such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units
    repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The
    liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

Advertising
    Costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included
    in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated
    statements of operations. Advertising expenses for 2010, 2009
    and 2008 were $10 million, $10 million and
    $9 million, respectively.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised of costs
    incurred in performing research and development activities,
    including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead
    costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and
    development expenses are expensed as incurred.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company has two stock-based compensation plans, which are
    described in Note 12, “Stock-Based Compensation”.

Earnings
    Per Share

In accordance with the earnings per share accounting standard,
    the Company presents two earnings per share (“EPS”)
    amounts. Income per basic common share is based on income
    available to common shareholders and the weighted-average number
    of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
    Income per diluted common share includes additional dilution
    from potential common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to
    the exercise of stock options outstanding.

Comprehensive
    Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with
    the accounting standards for comprehensive income, which
    establish the accounting rules for reporting and displaying
    comprehensive income. The standard requires that all components
    of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement
    that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial
    statements.

Subsequent
    Events

The Company did not have any material subsequent events.

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Standards

In June 2009, a new accounting standard was issued relating to
    the consolidation of variable interest entities. This statement
    addresses (1) the effects on certain provisions of existing
    accounting standards as a result of the elimination of the
    qualifying special-purpose entity concept and
    (2) constituent concerns about the application of certain
    key provisions of existing accounting standards, including those
    in which the accounting and disclosures under existing
    accounting standards do not always provide timely and useful
    information about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable
    interest entity. This standard is effective for periods
    beginning after November 15, 2009.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

In January 2010, the Company adopted a newly issued accounting
    standard which requires additional disclosure about the amounts
    of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of
    Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value measurements. This
    standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements related
    to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for
    each class of assets and liabilities and disclosure about inputs
    and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both
    recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and Level 3
    measurements. As this newly issued accounting standard only
    requires enhanced disclosure, the adoption of this standard did
    not impact the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations. In addition, effective for interim and annual
    periods beginning after December 15, 2010, this standard
    will require additional disclosure and require an entity to
    present disaggregated information about activity in Level 3
    fair-value measurements on a gross basis, rather than as one net
    amount.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

In October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for
    multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This consensus amends
    existing revenue recognition accounting standards. This
    consensus provides accounting principles and application
    guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the
    arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated.
    This guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair
    value of undelivered products and services and instead provides
    for separate revenue recognition based upon management’s
    estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there
    is no other means to determine the fair value of that
    undelivered item. Previously, the existing accounting consensus
    required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the
    price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between
    unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when
    the item is sold separately by the vendor. Under the existing
    accounting consensus, if the fair value of all of the elements
    in the arrangement was not determinable, then revenue was
    deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was
    determined. This new approach is effective prospectively for
    revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The
    adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Also in October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for
    certain revenue arrangements that include software elements.
    This consensus amends the existing accounting guidance for
    revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and
    software. This consensus requires that tangible products which
    contain software components and non-software components that
    function together to deliver the tangible products essential
    functionality are no longer within the scope of the software
    revenue guidance. This new approach is effective prospectively
    for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The
    adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

3  Out-of-Period

Adjustments

Accrual
    Balances

During the second quarter of 2010, the Company identified an
    error originating in periods prior to December 31, 2009.
    The error relates to an overstatement of the Company’s
    incentive plan and other accrual balances. The Company
    identified and corrected the error in the three months ended
    July 3, 2010 which reduced selling and administrative
    expense. The Company does not believe that the prior period
    error, individually or in the aggregate, was material to the
    year ended December 31, 2010 or any previously issued
    annual or quarterly financial statements. As a result, the
    Company did not restate its previously issued annual financial
    statements or interim financial data.

Capitalized
    Software

During 2008, the Company identified errors originating in
    periods prior to the three months ended June 28, 2008. The
    errors primarily related to (i) an overstatement of the
    Company’s income tax expense of $16 million as a
    result



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of errors in recording its income tax provision during the
    period from 2000 to March 29, 2008 and (ii) an
    understatement of amortization expense of $9 million for
    certain capitalized software. The Company incorrectly calculated
    its provision for income taxes by tax-effecting its tax
    liability utilizing a U.S. tax rate of 35% instead of an
    Irish tax rate of approximately 10%. In addition, the Company
    incorrectly accounted for Irish-based capitalized software and
    the related amortization expense as U.S. dollar-denominated
    instead of Euro-denominated, resulting in an understatement of
    amortization expense and cumulative translation adjustment.

The Company identified and corrected the errors in the three
    months ended June 28, 2008, which had the effect of
    increasing cost of sales by $9 million; reducing gross
    profit and income from operations before income tax by
    $9 million; reducing the provision for income taxes by
    $16 million and increasing net income by $8 million.
    For the year ended December 31, 2008, the errors had the
    effect of reducing the Company’s effective tax rate by
    4.0 percentage points. In addition, the

out-of-period

adjustments had the following effect on the consolidated balance
    sheet as of June 28, 2008: increased the gross carrying
    value of capitalized software by $46 million; increased
    accumulated amortization for capitalized software by
    $36 million; reduced deferred tax liabilities by
    $14 million; and increased accumulated other comprehensive
    income by $17 million.

The Company did not believe that the prior period errors,
    individually or in the aggregate, were material to any
    previously issued annual or quarterly financial statements. In
    addition, the Company did not believe that the adjustments
    described above to correct the cumulative effect of the errors
    in the three months ended June 28, 2008 were material to
    the three months ended June 28, 2008 or to the full year
    results for 2008. As a result, the Company did not restate its
    previously issued annual financial statements or interim
    financial data.

6  Acquisitions

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company implemented the
    newly issued accounting standard for business combinations. This
    standard requires an acquiring company to measure all assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent
    considerations and all contractual contingencies, at fair value
    as of the acquisition date. In addition, an acquiring company is
    required to capitalize IPR&D on its balance sheet at its
    acquisition date fair value. These IPR&D assets are
    accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the
    underlying project is completed. Once the project is completed,
    the carrying value of the IPR&D is amortized over the
    estimated useful life of the asset. If a project becomes
    impaired or abandoned, the carrying value of the IPR&D is
    written down to its fair value with the related impairment
    charge recognized in the period in which the impairment occurs.
    This accounting standard is applicable to acquisitions completed
    after January 1, 2009. Previous standards generally
    required post-acquisition adjustments related to business
    combination deferred tax asset valuation allowances and
    liabilities for uncertain tax positions to be recorded as an
    increase or decrease to goodwill. This new accounting standard
    does not permit this accounting and generally requires any such
    changes to be recorded in current period income tax expense.
    Thus, all changes to valuation allowances and liabilities for
    uncertain tax positions established in acquisition accounting,
    whether the business combination was accounted for under
    previous standards or under the newly issued accounting
    standard, will be recognized in current period income tax
    expense.

In February 2009, the Company acquired all of the remaining
    outstanding capital stock of Thar Instruments, Inc.
    (“Thar”), a privately-held global leader in the
    design, development and manufacture of analytical and
    preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical
    fluid extraction (“SFC”) systems, for $36 million
    in cash, including the assumption of $4 million of debt.
    The acquisition of Thar was accounted for under the newly issued
    accounting standard for business combinations and the results of
    Thar have been included in the consolidated results of the
    Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the
    acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and
    assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The
    Company has allocated $24 million of the purchase price to
    intangible assets comprised of customer relationships,
    non-compete agreements, acquired technology, IPR&D and
    other purchased intangibles. These intangible assets are being
    amortized over a weighted-average period of 13 years.
    Included in intangible assets is a trademark in the amount of
    $4 million, which has been assigned an indefinite life. The
    excess purchase price of $22 million has been accounted for
    as goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

In December 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of
    Analytical Products Group, Inc. (“APG”), a provider of
    environmental testing products for quality control and
    proficiency testing used in environmental laboratories, for
    $5 million in cash. This acquisition was accounted for
    under the purchase method of accounting and the results of APG
    have been included in the consolidated results of the Company
    from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition
    was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed
    liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The Company
    has allocated $3 million of the purchase price to
    intangible assets comprised of non-compete agreements, acquired
    technology, customer relationships and tradename. These
    intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average
    period of ten years. The excess purchase price of
    $1 million after this allocation has been accounted for as
    goodwill. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

In July 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of VTI
    Corporation (“VTI”), a manufacturer of sorption
    analysis and thermogravimetric analysis instruments, for
    $3 million in cash. This acquisition was accounted for
    under the purchase method of accounting and the results of VTI
    have been included in the consolidated results of the Company
    from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition
    was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed
    liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The Company
    has allocated $1 million of the purchase price to
    intangible assets comprised of a non-compete agreement and
    acquired technology. These intangible assets are being amortized
    over a weighted-average period of nine years. The excess
    purchase price of $2 million after this allocation has been
    accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is deductible for tax
    purposes.

The pro forma effect of the ongoing operations for Waters, Thar,
    APG and VTI as though these acquisitions had occurred at the
    beginning of the periods covered by this report is immaterial.

7  Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

The carrying amount of goodwill was $292 million,
    $293 million and $268 million at December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Currency translation
    adjustments decreased goodwill by $1 million in 2010 and
    increased goodwill by $3 million in 2009. In addition, the
    Company’s acquisition of Thar increased goodwill by
    $22 million in 2009 (Note 6).

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    acquired $24 million of purchased intangibles as a result
    of the acquisition of Thar. In addition, the gross carrying
    value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for
    intangible assets decreased by $17 million and
    $10 million, respectively, in the year ended
    December 31, 2010 due to the effect of foreign currency
    translation. The gross carrying value of intangible assets and
    accumulated amortization for intangible assets increased by
    $4 million and $3 million, respectively, in the year
    ended December 31, 2009 due to the effect of foreign
    currency translation.

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    amortization expense for intangible assets was $28 million,
    $25 million and $36 million, respectively. Included in
    amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2008
    is a $9 million

out-of-period

adjustment related to capitalized software. Amortization expense
    for intangible assets is estimated to be approximately
    $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and
    is estimated to increase to approximately $35 million each
    for the years 2012 through 2015.

8  Debt

In February 2010, the Company issued and sold five-year senior
    unsecured notes at an interest rate of 3.75% with a face value
    of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2015. In
    March 2010, the Company issued and sold ten-year senior
    unsecured notes at an interest rate of 5.00% with a face value
    of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2020. The
    Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior
    unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general
    corporate purposes. Interest on both issuances of senior
    unsecured notes is payable semi-annually in February and August
    of each year. The Company may redeem some of the notes at any
    time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal
    amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the
    applicable make-whole amount. These notes require that the
    Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less
    than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1
    for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters,
    respectively. In addition, these notes include customary
    negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and
    warranties and events of default.

In March 2008, the Company entered into a new credit agreement
    (the “2008 Credit Agreement”) that provided for a
    $150 million term loan facility. In October 2008, the
    Company utilized cash balances associated with the effective
    liquidation of certain foreign legal entities into the
    U.S. to voluntarily prepay the $150 million term loan
    under the 2008 Credit Agreement. The Company prepaid the term
    loan in order to reduce interest expense and there was no
    penalty for prepaying the term loan. The repayment of the term
    loan effectively terminated all lending arrangements under the
    2008 Credit Agreement.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In January 2007, the Company entered into a credit agreement
    (the “2007 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a
    $500 million term loan facility and $600 million in
    revolving facilities, which include both a letter of credit and
    a swingline subfacility. The 2007 Credit Agreement matures in
    January 2012 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that
    date. The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement
    are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate
    (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate
    plus


/


%)
    or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in
    each case plus a credit margin based upon the Company’s
    leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and
    72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate loans and range between
    zero basis points and 37.5 basis points for base rate
    loans. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company
    comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than
    3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any
    period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In
    addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants
    that are customary for investment grade credit facilities and
    customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants
    and events of default. The outstanding portions of the revolving
    facilities have been classified as short-term liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets due to the fact that the Company
    utilizes the revolving line of credit to fund its working
    capital needs. It is the Company’s intention to pay the
    outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the
    subsequent twelve months following the respective period end
    date.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with
    all debt covenants.

The Company had the following outstanding debt at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had a total
    amount available to borrow of $543 million and
    $479 million, respectively, after outstanding letters of
    credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the
    senior notes and 2007 Credit Agreement borrowings were 1.69% and
    0.78% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    increase in the weighted-average interest rate for the
    Company’s long-term debt is primarily due to a higher rate
    paid on the fixed-rate debt.

The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available
    short-term lines of credit totaling $111 million and
    $88 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and
    issuance of commercial guarantees. At December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the weighted-average interest rates applicable to the
    short-term borrowings were 2.10% and 1.97%, respectively.

Net deferred tax assets of $48 million and $21 million
    are included in other current assets and $20 million and
    $19 million are included in other assets at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company’s deferred tax assets associated with net
    operating loss, tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum
    tax credits are comprised of the following at December 31,
    2010: less than $1 million benefit of U.S. federal and
    state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in
    2020 and 2011, respectively; $14 million in foreign tax
    credits, which begin to expire in 2011; $13 million in
    research and development credits that begin to expire in 2011;
    and less than $1 million ($2 million pre-tax) in
    foreign net operating losses, less than $1 million
    ($2 million pre-tax) of which do not expire under current
    law. The Company has excluded the benefit of $14 million
    ($38 million pre-tax) of U.S. federal and state net
    operating loss carryforwards from the deferred tax asset balance
    at December 31, 2010. This amount represents an
    “excess tax benefit”, as the term is defined in the
    accounting standard for stock-based compensation, which will be
    recognized as a reduction to the Company’s accrued income
    taxes and an addition to its additional paid-in capital when it
    is realized in the Company’s tax returns.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had provided a
    deferred tax valuation allowance of $84 million,
    principally against foreign tax credits ($71 million),
    certain foreign net operating losses and other deferred tax
    assets. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the
    Company determined that it was more likely than not that it
    would realize some actual tax benefit of a portion of the
    deferred tax asset related to foreign tax credits, for which a
    full valuation allowance had been previously provided. During
    the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company realized a
    benefit of $12 million and determined that it expects to
    realize an additional benefit of $14 million in the future
    for this deferred tax asset. As a result, during the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company released the
    $71 million valuation allowance related to the deferred tax
    asset associated with the foreign tax credit carryforward,



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reduced the deferred tax asset associated with the foreign tax
    credit carryforward by $57 million (reduced to
    $14 million), reduced accrued taxes by $12 million and
    increased additional paid-in capital by $26 million. The
    Company increased additional paid-in capital because the
    valuation allowance that was originally established against this
    deferred tax asset was originally recorded as a reduction in
    additional paid-in capital. The Company believes that its
    current projections of future taxable income support its
    judgment that the remaining deferred tax asset of approximately
    $14 million will more likely than not be realized in the
    future, based on the Company’s review of all relevant facts
    and circumstances.

The income tax benefits associated with non-qualified stock
    option compensation expense recognized for tax purposes and
    credited to additional paid-in capital were $11 million,
    $5 million and $7 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

At December 31, 2010, there were unremitted earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1.7 billion. The
    Company has not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign
    withholding taxes on these earnings as it is the Company’s
    current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside
    the U.S.

The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting
    positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income
    taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the
    expected future tax consequences of those tax reporting
    positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities
    possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well
    as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit
    any discounting of those unrecognized tax benefits for the time
    value of money.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s
    unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    recorded a net $8 million tax benefit in the income tax
    provision which represents the realization of a reserve for
    uncertain United Kingdom tax benefits net of the net audit
    settlement. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2010,
    the Company recorded $2 million of tax benefit in the
    income tax provision related to the resolution of a
    pre-acquisition tax exposure. Included in the income tax
    provision for the year ended 2009 is approximately
    $5 million of tax benefit related to the reversal of a
    $5 million tax provision that was originally recorded in
    2008, relating to the reorganization of certain foreign legal
    entities. The recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a
    result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the
    U.S. Treasury in February 2009.

The Company’s uncertain tax positions are taken with
    respect to income tax return reporting periods beginning after
    December 31, 1999, which are the periods that generally
    remain open to income tax audit examination by the concerned
    income tax authorities. The Company continuously monitors the
    lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments
    for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax
    benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax
    assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2010, the
    Company does not expect to record any material changes in the
    measurement of any other unrecognized tax benefits, related net
    interest and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities
    due to the settlement of tax audit examinations or to the
    lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments
    within the next twelve months.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s effective tax rates for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 12.8%, 16.4% and
    13.4%, respectively. Included in the income tax provision for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 is the aforementioned
    $8 million tax benefit related to the reversal of reserves
    for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the
    United Kingdom and the aforementioned $2 million of tax
    benefit related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax
    exposure. These tax benefits decreased the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points in the year
    ended December 31, 2010. Included in the income tax
    provision for the year ended December 31, 2009 is the
    aforementioned $5 million of tax benefit related to the
    reversal of a $5 million provision that was originally
    recorded in 2008, related to the reorganization of certain
    foreign legal entities. The tax benefit in 2009 decreased the
    Company’s effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points
    in the year ended December 31, 2009. The one-time tax
    provision in 2008 increased the Company’s effective tax
    rate by 1.4 percentage points in the year ended
    December 31, 2008. In addition, the effective tax rate for
    2008 included a $16 million benefit resulting from

out-of-period

adjustments related to software capitalization amortization. The

out-of-period

adjustments had the effect of reducing the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points in the year
    ended December 31, 2008. The remaining differences between
    the effective tax rates for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were primarily
    attributable to differences in the proportionate amounts of
    pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different
    effective tax rates.

10  Litigation

The Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in
    the ordinary course of business. The Company believes the
    outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

The Company has been engaged in ongoing patent litigation with
    Agilent Technologies GmbH in France and Germany. In January
    2009, the French appeals court affirmed that the Company had
    infringed the Agilent Technologies GmbH patent and a judgment
    was issued against the Company. The Company has appealed this
    judgment. In 2008, the Company recorded a $7 million
    provision and, in the first quarter of 2009, the Company made a
    payment of $6 million for damages and fees estimated to be
    incurred in connection with the French litigation case. The
    accrued patent litigation expense is in other current
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. No provision has been made for
    the German patent litigation and the Company believes the
    outcome, if the plaintiff ultimately prevails, will not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial position.

11  Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Lease agreements, expiring at various dates through 2026, cover
    buildings, office equipment and automobiles. Rental expense was
    $27 million, $34 million and $30 million during
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Future minimum rents payable as of
    December 31, 2010 under non-cancelable leases with initial
    terms exceeding one year are as follows (in thousands):

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third

    for licenses were less than $1 million for each of the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Future
    minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements
    as of December 31, 2010 are immaterial for the years ended
    December 31, 2011 and thereafter.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
    in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
    business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
    its current litigation matters and



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not
    be material to the Company’s financial position or results
    of operations.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in
    its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements,
    the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse
    the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
    indemnified party, generally the Company’s business
    partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or
    other intellectual property infringement claims by any third
    party with respect to its current products, as well as claims
    relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from
    the performance of services by the Company or its
    subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments
    the Company could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the
    Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
    relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and
    management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of
    these agreements is immaterial.

12  Stock-Based
    Compensation

In May 2003, the Company’s shareholders approved the
    Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (“2003
    Plan”). As of December 31, 2010, the 2003 Plan has
    2.2 million shares available for granting in the form of
    incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
    rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock
    units or other types of awards. The Company issues new shares of
    common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock
    unit conversion. Under the 2003 Plan, the exercise price for
    stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the
    underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2003 Plan is
    scheduled to terminate on March 4, 2013. Options generally
    will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they
    are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally
    vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR
    may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other
    award. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units may
    be issued under the 2003 Plan for such consideration as is
    determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. No award of restricted stock may have a restriction
    period of less than three years except as may be recommended by
    the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or with
    respect to any award of restricted stock which provides solely
    for a performance-based risk of forfeiture so long as such award
    has a restriction period of at least one year. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company had stock options,
    restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards outstanding.

In February 2009, the Company adopted its 2009 Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan under which eligible employees may contribute up
    to 15% of their earnings toward the quarterly purchase of the
    Company’s common stock. The plan makes available
    0.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock,
    which includes the remaining shares available under the 1996
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2010,
    1.0 million shares have been issued under both the 2009 and
    1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plans. Each plan period lasts three
    months beginning on January 1, April 1, July 1 and
    October 1 of each year. The purchase price for each share of
    stock is the lesser of 90% of the market price on the first day
    of the plan period or 100% of the market price on the last day
    of the plan period. Stock-based compensation expense related to
    this plan was less than $1 million, $1 million and
    $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in
    accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based
    compensation, which require that all share-based payments to
    employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on
    their fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the
    straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation
    expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations
    is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest;
    therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated
    forfeitures. The stock-based compensation accounting standards
    require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and
    revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
    forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were
    estimated based on historical experience. If actual results
    differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based
    compensation expense and the Company’s results of
    operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the
    Company employs different assumptions in the application of this
    standard, the compensation expense that the Company records in
    the future periods may differ significantly from what the
    Company has recorded in the current period.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The consolidated statements of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 include the following
    stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards,
    restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards and the employee
    stock purchase plan (in thousands):

As of both December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company has
    capitalized stock-based compensation costs of less than
    $1 million in inventory in the consolidated balance sheets.
    As of both December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company has
    capitalized stock-based compensation costs of $3 million in
    capitalized software in the consolidated balance sheets. The
    reduction in stock-based compensation expense for 2010 as
    compared to 2009 and 2008 is primarily a result of a shift over
    time in stock-based compensation grants from stock options to
    restricted stock units.

Stock
    Options

In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company
    makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including
    volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option
    lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    Company uses implied volatility on its publicly traded options
    as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The
    Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate
    indicator of expected volatility because it is generally
    reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how
    future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The
    expected life assumption for grants is based on historical
    experience for the population of non-qualified stock optionees.
    The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
    approximating the expected term used as the input to the
    Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the
    value of the stock options granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008
    are as follows:

    Company had 2.5 million, 3.3 million and
    1.3 million stock options that were antidilutive,
    respectively, due to having higher exercise prices than the
    Company’s average stock price during the period. These
    securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS.
    The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the

15  Retirement
    Plans

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution plan,
    after one month of service. Employees may contribute from 1% to
    30% of eligible pay on a pre-tax basis and the Company makes
    matching contributions of 100% for contributions up to 6% of
    eligible pay. Employees are 100% vested in employee and Company
    matching contributions. For the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company’s matching contributions
    amounted to $11 million, $10 million and
    $10 million, respectively. In addition, the Company also
    sponsors various other employee benefit plans (primarily defined
    contribution plans) outside the United States. The Company
    contributed $11 million, $10 million and
    $10 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, to these

non-U.S. plans.

Prior to December 31, 2007, U.S. employees were
    eligible to participate in the Waters Retirement Plan, a defined
    benefit, cash balance plan, after one year of service. Prior to
    the freeze of pay credit accruals in 2007, the Company credited
    each employee’s account annually as a percentage of
    eligible pay based on years of service. Each employee’s
    account continues to be credited with interest at the end of
    each year based on the employee’s account balance at the
    beginning of such year. The interest rate is the one-year
    constant maturity Treasury bond yield in effect as of the first
    business day in November preceding such year plus 0.5%, limited
    to a minimum interest crediting rate of 5% and a maximum
    interest crediting rate of 10%. An employee does not vest until
    the completion of three years of service, at which time the
    employee becomes 100% vested. The Company maintains an unfunded
    supplemental executive retirement plan, the Waters Retirement
    Restoration Plan, which is non-qualified and restores the
    benefits under the Waters Retirement Plan that are limited by
    IRS benefit and compensation maximums. As part of the amendments
    made in 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a
    $13 million payment that was contributed to the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan in the first quarter of 2008.

The Company also sponsors other employee benefit plans in the
    U.S., including a retiree healthcare plan, which provides
    reimbursement for medical expenses and is contributory. There
    are various

non-U.S. retirement

plans sponsored by the Company. The eligibility and vesting of
    the

non-U.S. plans

are generally consistent with local laws and regulations.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The net periodic pension cost is made up of several components
    that reflect different aspects of the Company’s financial
    arrangements as well as the cost of benefits earned by
    employees. These components are determined using the projected
    unit credit actuarial cost method and are based on certain
    actuarial assumptions. The Company’s accounting policy is
    to reflect in the projected benefit obligation all benefit
    changes to which the Company is committed as of the current
    valuation date; use a market-related value of assets to
    determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior service
    costs on a straight-line basis over the expected future service
    of active participants as of the date such costs are first
    recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and losses
    in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related value of
    plan assets and the projected benefit obligation over the
    expected future service of active participants.

Summary data for the Waters Retirement Plan, Waters Retirement
    Restoration Plan (collectively, the “U.S. Pension
    Plans”), the U.S. retiree healthcare plan and the

The asset allocation policy for the U.S. Pension Plans and
    U.S. retiree healthcare plan was developed in consideration
    of the following long-term investment objectives: achieving a
    return on assets consistent with the investment policy,
    achieving portfolio returns which exceed the average return for
    similarly invested funds and maximizing portfolio returns with
    at least a return of 2.5% above the one-year constant maturity
    Treasury bond yield over reasonable measurement periods and
    based on reasonable market cycles.

Within the equity portfolio of the U.S. retirement plans,
    investments are diversified among market capitalization and
    investment strategy. The Company targets a 20% allocation of its
    U.S. retirement plans’ equity portfolio

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
    assumption, the Company considered the historical returns and
    the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as
    well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio and
    historical expenses paid by the plan. A one-quarter percentage
    point increase in the discount rate would decrease the
    Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters
    Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one-quarter
    percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate of
    return would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit
    cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million.

During fiscal year 2011, the Company expects to contribute a
    total of approximately $3 million to $5 million to the
    Company’s defined benefit plans.

16  Business
    Segment Information

The accounting standard for segment reporting establishes
    standards for reporting information about operating segments in
    annual financial statements and requires selected information
    for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports
    of public business enterprises. It also establishes standards
    for related disclosures about products and services, geographic
    areas and major customers. The Company’s business
    activities, for which discrete financial information is
    available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief
    operating decision makers. As a result of this evaluation, the
    Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters
    Division and TA Division.

Waters Division is primarily in the business of designing,
    manufacturing, distributing and servicing LC and MS instruments,
    columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated
    and used along with other analytical instruments. TA Division is
    primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing,
    distributing and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and
    calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two divisions are
    its operating segments and each has similar economic
    characteristics; product processes; products and services; types
    and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory
    environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments
    have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial
    statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial
    statements for financial information regarding the one
    reportable segment of the Company.

The Company experiences an increase in sales in the fourth
    quarter, as a result of purchasing habits on capital goods of
    customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by
    calendar year end. Selling and administrative expenses are
    typically higher in the second and third quarters over the first
    quarter in each year as the Company’s annual payroll merit
    increases take effect. Selling and administrative expenses will
    vary in the fourth quarter in relation to performance in the
    quarter and for the year. In the first quarter of 2010, the
    Company recorded $2 million of tax benefit related to the
    resolution of a pre-acquisition tax exposure. In the third
    quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a net $8 million tax
    benefit in the income tax provision related to the reversal of
    reserves for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement
    in the United Kingdom. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company
    recorded approximately $5 million of tax benefit relating
    to the reversal of a $5 million tax provision which was
    originally recorded in the third quarter of 2008 relating to the
    reorganization of certain foreign legal entities (Note 9).

As result of the adoption of the newly issued accounting
    standard for employers’ accounting for defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans as of December 31,
    2006, the Company is required to recognize the underfunded
    status of the Company’s retirement plans as a liability in
    the consolidated balance sheets. Prior to 2006, a significant
    portion of the Company’s retirement contribution accrual
    was classified in other current liabilities and included in
    working capital. Beginning in 2006, in accordance with this
    standard, the majority of the retirement contribution accrual is
    included in the long-term retirement liability. Also, the
    adoption of this standard had the following after-tax effect on
    stockholders’ equity: increased $3 million in 2009,
    decreased $20 million in 2008, increased $9 million in
    2007 and decreased $2 million in 2006.

*

As a result of the adoption of newly issued accounting standard
    for income tax uncertainty as of January 1, 2007, the
    Company is required to measure, report, present and disclose in
    its financial statements the effects of any uncertain tax return
    reporting positions that a company has taken or expects to take.
    Prior to January 1, 2007, these amounts were included in
    accrued income taxes in current liabilities. On January 1,
    2007, the Company recorded the effect of adopting this new
    standard with a $4 million charge to beginning retained
    earnings and a $58 million reclassification from accrued
    income taxes, which was included in working capital, to the
    long-term income tax liability in the consolidated balance sheet.

Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
    as of December 31, 2010 (1) to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed by the Company, including its
    consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or
    submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
    to the Company’s management, including its chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions
    regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
    forms.
