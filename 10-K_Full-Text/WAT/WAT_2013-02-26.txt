WATERS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

INDEX


PART I

Item 1:

Business

General

Waters Corporation (“Waters

®

” or the “Company”) is an analytical instrument manufacturer that primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters Division, high
performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC

®

”
and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These
systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using a common software platform and are used along with other analytical instruments. Through its TA Division
(“TA

®

”), the Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry
and calorimetry instruments. The Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument system.

The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, life science, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental,
academic and governmental customers working in research and development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications. The Company’s LC and LC-MS instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and
measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, as well as to purify a full range of compounds. These instruments are used in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in
disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. The Company’s thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, water, polymers and viscous liquids for uses in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research.

Waters, organized as a Delaware corporation in 1991, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common
stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating subsidiary. Waters became a publicly-traded company with its initial public offering (“IPO”) in November 1995. Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and complementary
technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited
(“Micromass

®

”) in September 1997.

Business Segments

The Company’s business activities, for which financial information
is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision makers. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters Division and TA Division. The Company operates in the
analytical instruments industry by designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing instrument systems, columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The Company’s two
operating segments, Waters Division and TA Division, have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities,
the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes.

Information concerning
revenues and long-lived assets attributable to each of the Company’s products, services and geographic areas is set forth in Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Waters Division

High
Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography

HPLC is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent
components of a variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes that HPLC’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and



identify approximately 80% of all known chemicals and materials. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes, quality
control and process engineering applications.

The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served by the
pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these markets, HPLC is used extensively to identify new drugs, develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other
applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations, the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry, as well as applications in other industries, such
as chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by universities, research institutions and governmental agencies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”) and their international counterparts that mandate testing requiring HPLC instrumentation.

Traditionally, a typical HPLC system has consisted of five basic components: solvent delivery system, sample injector, separation column,
detector and data acquisition unit. The solvent delivery system pumps solvents through the HPLC system, while the sample injector introduces samples into the solvent flow. The chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for
analysis by the detector, which measures the presence and amount of the constituents. The data acquisition unit, usually referred to as the instrument’s software or data system, then records and stores the information from the detector.

In 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company describes as ultra performance liquid
chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY UPLC

®

, to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles. By using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and
analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by HPLC. In addition, in using ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications
beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to uncover new levels of scientific information. While offering significant performance advantages, ACQUITY UPLC is also compatible with the Company’s software products and the general operating protocols of
HPLC. For these reasons, the Company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument. In 2010, Waters introduced the ACQUITY UPLC

®

H-Class instrument system, which incorporates the performance of ACQUITY UPLC with the operational familiarity of
traditional HPLC systems. The ACQUITY UPLC H-Class is a streamlined system that brings together the flexibility and simplicity of quaternary solvent blending and a flow-through needle injector to deliver the advanced performance expected of
UPLC-type separations. The ACQUITY UPLC H-Class delivers high resolution, sensitivity and improved through-put while maintaining the robustness and reliability for which the ACQUITY systems are known. In 2011, the Company introduced the ACQUITY UPLC

®

I-Class instrument system. The ACQUITY UPLC I-Class provides a powerful solution to a critical need by successfully
analyzing compounds that are limited in amount or availability amid a complex matrix. The ACQUITY UPLC I-Class system maximizes peak capacity to enhance MS sensitivity; it provides the lowest carryover, complementing MS sensitivity and extending MS
linear dynamic range; and it has been purposefully engineered for the lowest dispersion. In 2012, the Company introduced UltraPerformance Convergence Chromatography

TM

(“UPC

2™

”) with the release of the ACQUITY

®

UPC

2™

system. This new technology marries the unrealized potential of supercritical fluid chromatography (“SFC”) with the proven UPLC technology, using carbon dioxide as the primary mobile phase. By
varying mobile phase strength, pressure, temperature and stationary phase with UPC


, a user can separate, detect and quantify structural analogs, isomers, enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures – all compounds or samples that challenge today’s laboratories.

Waters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation, from component
configured systems for academic research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing, and that have a variety of detection technologies, from ultra-violet (“UV”) absorbance to MS, optimized for certain analyses. The
Company also manufactures tailored LC systems for the analysis of



biologics, as well as an LC detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of LC to compounds that are not amenable to UV absorbance detection.

The primary consumable products for LC are chromatography columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in the LC testing
process and are replaced at regular intervals. The chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from silica. As the sample flows through the column, it is separated into its
constituent components.

Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and competitors’ LC systems. The Company
believes that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica, packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key attribute for its customers in quality
control laboratories, and can react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company believes that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used nearly exclusively on its ACQUITY UPLC instrument systems and, furthermore, that its ACQUITY UPLC
instrument primarily uses ACQUITY UPLC columns.

The Company’s chemistry consumable products also include environmental
and nutritional safety testing products. Environmental laboratories use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation
requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis. In addition, the Company provides tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins in various agricultural commodities. These test kits provide reliable, quantitative detection of
particular mycotoxins through the choice of flurometer, LC-MS or HPLC.

Mass Spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry

MS is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials and to elucidate the
structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions.

The Company believes it is a market leader in the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of MS instruments. These instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary
analytical instruments and systems, such as LC, chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography. A wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of MS instrumentation, including
devices that incorporate quadrupole, ion trap, time-of-flight (“Tof”) and classic magnetic sector technologies. Furthermore, these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain experiments.

Currently, the Company offers a wide range of MS instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof, ion mobility and
magnetic sector designs. These instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development, as well as for environmental, clinical and nutritional safety testing. The majority of mass spectrometers sold by the Company are designed to utilize an LC
system as the sample introduction device. These products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science, pharmaceutical, biomedical, clinical, food and beverage and environmental market segments worldwide.

MS is an increasingly important detection technology for LC. The Company’s smaller-sized mass spectrometers,
such as the single quadrupole detector (“SQD”) and the tandem quadrupole detector (“TQD”), are often referred to as LC “detectors” and are typically sold as part of an LC system or as an LC system upgrade. Larger
quadrupole systems, such as the Xevo

®

TQ and Xevo

®

TQ-S instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for late-stage drug development, including clinical trial testing. Quadrupole time-of-flight
(“Q-Tof

TM

”) instruments, such as the
Company’s SYNAPT

®

G2-S, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes, an application
sometimes referred to as “proteomics”. In 2010, the Company introduced the Xevo TQ-S instrument system, which is designed for the most demanding UPLC/MS/MS applications. Also in 2010, the Company introduced the Xevo

®

G2 Q-Tof

TM

instrument system. The Xevo G2 Q-Tof is one of the most sensitive, exact mass quantitative and qualitative bench-top
MS/MS instrument systems developed because



it combines the integrated workflow benefits of Engineered
Simplicity

TM

found in existing Xevo Q-Tof instrument
systems with the QuanTof

TM

technology of the SYNAPT

®

G2 instrument system. In 2011, the Company introduced the SYNAPT

®

G2-S HDMS instrument system. The SYNAPT G2-S incorporates both high-sensitivity Waters StepWave

TM

ion transfer optics and Triwave

®

ion mobility technologies along with a suite of new informatics tools to enhance qualitative and quantitative high resolution performance. In 2012, the Company
introduced the Xevo

®

G2-S Q-Tof

TM

and Xevo

®

G2-S Tof mass spectrometers, bringing StepWave ion technology to its bench-top time-of-flight mass spectrometers.

LC and MS are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose
analytical device. An increasing percentage of the Company’s customers are purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it has become common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same
user. The descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly in today’s instrument market, this segmentation and
categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS technologies as part of a single device. In response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid
instruments, the Company has organized its Waters Division to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated LC-MS systems.

Based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly-disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company believes
that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of LC and LC-MS instrument systems, chromatography columns and other consumables and related services. The Company also believes that it has the leading LC and LC-MS market
share in the United States, Europe and Asia, and believes it may have a market share position in Japan that ranks second to a domestic supplier.

The Company has been a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments. The Company recently introduced a new UNIFI

®

software platform. The UNIFI Scientific Information System is the culmination of a multi-year effort to bring all of
Waters’ preexisting, disparate software systems under one operating system. UNIFI joins Waters’ suite of informatics products – Empower

®

, Chromatography Data Software,
MassLynx

®

Mass Spectrometry Software and NuGenesis

®

Scientific Data Management System, each of which is used daily to support innovations within world-leading institutions. UNIFI is the industry’s first
comprehensive software that seamlessly integrates UPLC chromatography, mass spectrometry, and informatics data workflows in one platform.

In July 2012, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Blue Reference, Inc. (“Blue Reference”), a U.S.-based developer and distributor of software products used for the
real-time mining and analysis of multiple-application scientific databases, for $14 million in cash. The Company will integrate the Blue Reference technology into current and future software product platforms to further differentiate its offerings
by providing customers with a more efficient scientific information assessment process, where there is an ongoing need for immediacy and interactivity of multiple scientific databases.

Waters Division Service

Services provided by Waters enable customers to maximize
technology productivity, support customer compliance activities and provide transparency into enterprise resource management efficiencies. The customer benefits from improved budget control, data-driven technology adoption and accelerated workflow
at a site or on a global perspective. The Company considers its service offerings to be highly differentiated from our competition, as evidenced by the consistent increase in service revenues each year. Our principal competitors in the service
market include PerkinElmer, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and General Electric Company. These competitors can provide services on Waters instruments to varying degrees and always present competitive risk.

The servicing and support of instruments, software and accessories is an important source of revenue and represents over 25%
of sales for the Waters Division. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale of



support plans, demand service, customer training and performance validation services. Support plans typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to promptly repair a
non-functioning instrument in return for a fee described in a contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument.

TA
Division

Thermal Analysis, Rheometry and Calorimetry

Thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials, such as their physical state, weight,
dimension and mechanical and electrical properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal analysis techniques, including calorimetry. Consequently, thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development, production and
characterization of materials in various industries, such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and electronics.

Rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow properties of materials
and measures their viscosity, elasticity and deformation under different types of “loading” or other conditions. The information obtained under such conditions provides insight into a material’s behavior during processing, packaging,
transport, usage and storage.

Thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are heavily used in material
testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide information useful in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research.
As with systems offered through the Waters Division, a range of instrument configurations is available with increasing levels of sample handling and information processing automation. In addition, systems and accompanying software packages can be
tailored for specific applications. For example, the Q-Series

TM

family of differential scanning calorimeters includes a range of instruments, from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive systems that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a variety of sample
cells and temperature control features for analyzing a broad range of materials. In 2010, TA introduced the Nano ITC Low Volume system, which is engineered to provide isothermal titration calorimetry capabilities for applications with limited sample
sizes. Also in 2010, TA introduced the DMA-RH Accessory, which is designed to be used with the Q800 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer to allow the mechanical properties of a sample to be analyzed under controlled and/or varying conditions of both relative
humidity and temperature. In 2011, TA introduced the Discovery DSC, Discovery TGA and Discovery Hybrid Rheometer, which provide unmatched measurement performance in the fields of differential scanning calorimetry and rheometry.

In July 2011, the Company acquired Anter Corporation (“Anter”), a manufacturer of thermal analyzers used to measure thermal
expansion and shrinkage, thermal conductivity and resistivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat capacity of a wide range of materials, especially materials used in high temperature applications, for $11 million in cash. Anter systems provide
critical information to scientists that develop and characterize ceramics, metals and glasses for use in a wide range of industries, including electronics, energy and aerospace.

In January 2012, the Company acquired Baehr Thermoanalyse GmbH (“Baehr”), a German manufacturer of a wide range of thermal
analyzers, for $12 million in cash, including the assumption of $1 million of debt. Key products developed by Baehr include horizontal, optical, and quenching dilatometer systems that measure thermal expansion to high temperatures with high
precision, high temperature viscometers, and high temperature TGA/DTA systems. Baehr systems provide critical information to researchers that develop materials for use in a wide range of industries including electronics, energy, automotive, and
aerospace.

TA Service

Similar to the Waters Division, the servicing and support of TA’s instruments is an important source of revenue and represents approximately 25% of
sales for the TA Division. TA sells, supports and services TA’s product offerings through its headquarters in New Castle, Delaware. TA operates independently from the Waters



Division, though most of its overseas offices are situated in Waters Division’s facilities to achieve operational efficiencies. TA has dedicated field sales and service operations. Service
sales are primarily derived from the sale of support plans, replacement parts and billed labor fees associated with the repair, maintenance and upgrade of installed systems.

Customers

The Company typically has a broad and diversified customer base that includes
pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts, universities and governmental agencies. Purchase of the Company’s instrument systems is often dependent on its customers’ capital spending, or funding as in the cases of governmental,
academic and research institutions, which can fluctuate from year to year. The pharmaceutical segment represents the Company’s largest sector and includes multinational pharmaceutical companies, generic drug manufacturers, contract research
organizations (CROs) and biotechnology companies. The Company’s other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers, polymer manufacturers, food and beverage companies and environmental testing laboratories. The Company also sells to
various universities and governmental agencies worldwide. The Company’s technical support staff works closely with its customers in developing and implementing applications that meet their full range of analytical requirements. During 2012, 53%
of the Company’s sales were to pharmaceutical accounts, 33% to other industrial accounts and 14% to university and governmental agencies.

The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year
end. The Company does not rely on any single customer or one group of customers for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, no single customer accounted for more than 3% of the Company’s net sales.

Sales and Service

The Company has one
of the largest direct sales and service organizations in the industry, focused exclusively on the various instrument systems’ installed base. Across these product technologies, using respective specialized sales and service forces, the Company
serves its customer base with 94 sales offices throughout the world as of December 31, 2012 and approximately 3,000, 2,900 and 2,700 field representatives in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This investment in sales and service personnel
serves to maintain and expand the Company’s installed base of customers. The Company’s sales representatives have direct responsibility for account relationships, while service representatives work in the field to install instruments,
train customers and minimize instrument downtime. In-house, technical support representatives work directly with customers, providing them assistance with applications and procedures on Company products. The Company provides customers with
comprehensive information through various corporate and regional internet websites and product literature, and also makes consumable products available through electronic ordering facilities and a dedicated catalog.

Manufacturing and Distribution

The
Company provides high quality LC products by overseeing each stage of the production of its instruments, columns and chemical reagents. The Company currently assembles a portion of its LC instruments at its facility in Milford, Massachusetts, where
it performs machining, assembly and testing. The Milford facility maintains quality management and environmental management systems in accordance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2008, ISO 13485:2003 and ISO 14001:2004, and adheres to applicable
regulatory requirements (including the FDA Quality System Regulation and the European In-Vitro Diagnostic Directive). The Company outsources manufacturing of certain electronic components, such as computers, monitors and circuit boards, to outside
vendors that can meet the Company’s quality requirements. In addition, the Company outsources the manufacturing of certain LC instrument systems and components to well-established contract manufacturing firms in Singapore. The Company’s
Singapore entity manages all Asian outsourced manufacturing as well as the distribution of all products to Asia. The Company continues to pursue outsourcing opportunities as they may arise but believes it maintains adequate supply chain and
manufacturing capabilities in the event of disruption or natural disasters.



The Company manufactures and distributes its LC columns at its
facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland, where it processes, sizes and treats silica and polymeric media that are packed into columns, solid phase extraction cartridges and bulk shipping containers. The Wexford facility also
manufactures and distributes certain data, instruments and software components for the Company’s LC, MS and TA product lines. The Company’s Taunton facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008. The Wexford facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008
and ISO 13485:2003. VICAM

®

manufactures antibody resin and magnetic beads that are packed into columns and kits
in Milford, Massachusetts and Nixa, Missouri. Environmental Resource Associates manufactures environmental proficiency kits in Golden, Colorado.

The Company manufactures and distributes its MS products at its facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire, England and Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the Company’s MS
instruments are manufactured by long-standing outside contractors. Each stage of this supply chain is closely monitored by the Company to maintain high quality and performance standards. The instruments, components or modules are then returned to
the Company’s facilities where its engineers perform final assembly, calibrations to customer specifications and quality control procedures. The Company’s MS facilities are certified to ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 13485:2003.

TA’s thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry products are manufactured and distributed at the Company’s New Castle,
Delaware, Lindon, Utah and Huellhorst, Germany facilities. Similar to MS, elements of TA’s products are manufactured by outside contractors and are then returned to the Company’s facilities for final assembly, calibration and quality
control. The Company’s New Castle facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008 standards.

Raw Materials

The Company purchases a variety of raw materials, primarily consisting of high temperature alloy sheet metal and castings, forgings, pre-plated metals and
electrical components from various vendors. The materials used by the Company’s operations are generally available from a number of sources and in sufficient quantities to meet current requirements subject to normal lead times. The Company is
subject to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as
conflict minerals, which may be contained in the Company’s products are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. These rules are likely to impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the
Company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products.

Research and Development

The Company maintains an active research and development program focused on the development and commercialization of products that both complement and
update its existing product offering. The Company’s research and development expenditures for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $96 million, $92 million and $84 million, respectively. Nearly all of the Company’s current LC products
are developed at the Company’s main research and development center located in Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the Company’s extensive field organizations and customers. The majority of the Company’s
MS products are developed at facilities in England and nearly all of the Company’s current thermal analysis products are developed at the Company’s research and development center in New Castle, Delaware. At December 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010, there were 777, 741 and 697 employees, respectively, involved in the Company’s research and development efforts. The Company has increased research and development expenses from its continued commitment to invest significantly in
new product development and existing product enhancements, and as a result of acquisitions. Despite the Company’s active research and development programs, there can be no assurances that the Company’s product development and
commercialization efforts will be successful or that the products developed by the Company will be accepted by the marketplace.



Employees

The Company employed approximately 5,900, 5,700 and 5,400 employees at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, with approximately 45% of the Company’s employees located in the United
States. The Company believes its employee relations are generally good. The Company’s employees are not unionized or affiliated with any internal or external labor organizations. The Company firmly believes that its future success largely
depends upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees.

Competition

The analytical instrument systems market is highly competitive. The Company encounters competition from several worldwide manufacturers and other
companies in both domestic and foreign markets for each of its three technologies. The Company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of product performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser extent, price. Competitors continuously
introduce new products or have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company’s business. Some competitors have greater financial and other resources than the Company.

In the markets served by the Waters Division, the Company’s principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., Shimadzu
Corporation, Bruker Corporation, Danaher Corporation and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. In the markets served by the TA Division, the Company’s principal competitors include: PerkinElmer, Inc., Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,
NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern Instruments Ltd., Anton-Paar and General Electric Company.

The market for consumable LC products, including separation columns, is highly competitive and more fragmented than the analytical
instruments market. The Company encounters competition in the consumable columns market from chemical companies that produce column chemicals and small specialized companies that pack and distribute columns. The Company believes that it is one of
the few suppliers that processes silica, packs columns and distributes its own products. The Company competes in this market on the basis of reproducibility, reputation, performance and, to a lesser extent, price. The Company’s principal
competitors for consumable products include: Phenomenex, Inc., Supelco, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., General Electric Company, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Merck and Co., Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to offer a predictable
level of performance when used with ACQUITY UPLC columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the ACQUITY UPLC instrument base will enhance its chromatographic column business because of the high level of synergy between ACQUITY UPLC
columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instrument.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

The Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents and has patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. Certain technology and software has been acquired or is licensed
from third parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or
license is, in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss would materially affect the Company’s business as a whole.

Environmental Matters and Climate Change

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or operations that may have adverse
environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages resulting from sites of past
spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations and has operated its business in the past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. From time to time,
Company operations have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The



Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its operations, financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws.

The Company is sensitive to the growing global debate with respect to climate change. An internal sustainability working
group develops increasingly robust data with respect to the Company’s utilization of carbon producing substances in an effort to continuously reduce the Company’s carbon footprint. In 2012, the Company published a sustainability report
identifying the various actions and behaviors the Company has adopted concerning its commitment to both the environment and the broader topic of social responsibility. See Item 1A, Risk Factors –

Item 1A:

Risk Factors

The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, the following:

Global economic conditions may decrease demand for the Company’s products and harm our financial results.

The Company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions. These changes in global economic conditions may
affect the demand for the Company’s products and services and may result in a decline in sales in the future. There can be no assurance regarding demand for the Company’s products and services in the future.

Disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the Company’s access to capital and financial condition.

Financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have experienced times of extreme disruption in recent years, including, among other things, sharp
increases in the cost of new capital, credit rating downgrades and bailouts,



severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets. Financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions, resulting in large asset
write-downs, higher costs of capital, rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money. There can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions. Any future
deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the Company participates may impair the Company’s ability to access its existing cash, utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility, funded by
such financial institutions, and impair its ability to access sources of new capital. The Company’s cost of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur.

The Company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand, which may decrease for a number of reasons, many beyond the
Company’s control.

The demand for the Company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its LC, LC-MS, thermal
analysis, rheometry and calorimetry products; the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the Company’s customers; changes in governmental regulations, particularly affecting drug, food and drinking water testing; funding
available to governmental, academic and research institutions; general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the Company’s major markets; and competitive considerations. The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in
its fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. There can be no assurance that the Company’s results of operations or financial condition will
not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions.

Additionally, the analytical instrument market may, from time to time, experience low sales growth. Approximately 53% and 52% of the Company’s net sales in 2012 and 2011, respectively, were to the
worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations or financial condition.

Competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the Company’s, which
could result in decreased sales.

The analytical instrument market and, in particular, the portion related to the Company’s HPLC,
UPLC, LC-MS, thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines, is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. The Company encounters competition from several international instrument manufacturers and other companies in
both domestic and foreign markets. Some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company’s business, but are typically less focused on the Company’s chosen markets. There can be no assurance that
the Company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the Company or that the Company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions. There can be no assurance
that the Company’s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the Company’s competitors in the future.

The
Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the U.S.

The Company had approximately $1,178 million in debt and $1,539 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, the Company also
had the ability to borrow an additional $428 million from its existing, committed credit facilities. Most of the Company’s debt is in the U.S. There is a substantial cash requirement in the U.S. to fund operations and capital expenditures,
service debt interest obligations, finance potential acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs. A majority of the Company’s cash is generated from foreign operations, with $1,489 million of the Company’s cash held by
foreign subsidiaries. The Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the U.S. to address these requirements through (1) cash
from U.S. operations, (2) efficient, cost-effective and timely distribution of cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, (3) the Company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility and (4) other sources of capital
obtained at an acceptable cost.



Debt covenants, and the Company’s failure to comply with them, could negatively impact the
Company’s capital and financial results.

The Company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the
Company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the Company. These debt covenants include restrictions on the Company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements that may limit the Company’s
ability to make dividend or other payments, secure other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Company is also required to meet specified
financial ratios under the terms of the Company’s debt agreements. The Company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on the Company’s future performance, which is subject to, but not limited
to, prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond the Company’s control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.

Disruption of operations at the Company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the Company’s financial condition.

The Company manufactures LC instruments at facilities in Milford, Massachusetts and through a subcontractor in Singapore; chemistry separation columns at
its facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland; MS products at its facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire, England and Wexford, Ireland; thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in New Castle, Delaware and other
instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the Company’s acquisitions. Any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility
or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The
Company’s international operations may be negatively affected by foreign political and regulatory changes, related to either a specific country or a larger region. Currency and economic disruptions and foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

Approximately 71% of
the Company’s net sales in both 2012 and 2011 were outside of the United States and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company has considerable manufacturing operations in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well
as significant subcontractors located in Singapore. As a result, a significant portion of the Company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks, including adverse developments in the foreign political, regulatory and economic
environment, in particular, the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of European countries; the instability and possible dissolution of the Euro as a single currency; sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange
rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices; tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and associated adverse operational, contractual
and tax consequences.

Additionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating
expenses, interest, taxes and net income varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect or benefit
on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The loss of key members of management could adversely affect the
Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The operation of the Company requires managerial and operational expertise.
None of the Company’s key management employees have an employment contract with the Company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company. If, for any reason, such key personnel do not continue to be active in
management, the Company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.



Failure to adequately protect intellectual property could have an adverse and material effect on the
Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The Company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights and seeks
patent coverage on all developments that it regards as material and patentable. However, there can be no assurance that any patents held by the Company will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will
provide competitive advantages to the Company. Conversely, there could be successful claims against the Company by third-party patent holders with respect to certain Company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third
parties. The Company’s patents, including those licensed from others, expire on various dates. If the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights, it could have an adverse and material effect on the Company’s results of
operations or financial condition.

The Company’s business would suffer if the Company were unable to acquire adequate sources of
supply.

Most of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by the Company are available from a number of different suppliers;
however, a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have, at a minimum, a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the Company. A prolonged inability to
obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely affect the
Company’s business.

The Company’s sales would deteriorate if the Company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary
components or modules.

Certain components or modules of the Company’s LC and MS instruments are manufactured by long-standing outside
contractors, including the manufacturing of LC instrument systems and related components by well-established contract manufacturing firms in Singapore. Disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply
chain and the financial results of the Company. A prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

The Company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pre-tax income between tax jurisdictions and changing application of tax law.

The Company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0% to in excess of 35% in various jurisdictions in which it conducts
business. In addition, the Company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including, but not limited
to, changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates, could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the Company’s income tax expense, effective tax rate and results of
operations. In addition, governments in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time. Any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or
repatriation of dividends or capital, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations, in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its
overall tax burden, which would negatively affect the Company’s profitability.

Disruption or unforeseen problems with the security,
maintenance or upgrade of the Company’s information systems could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial condition.

The Company relies on its technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell products and services, fulfill contract obligations, ship products, collect and make payments
and otherwise conduct business. The Company’s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from, but not limited to, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses,
unauthorized access to customer or employee data and other attempts to harm the Company’s systems. Any prolonged disruption to the Company’s technology infrastructure, at any of its facilities, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations or financial condition.



The effects of climate change could harm the Company’s business.

The Company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various
international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. In the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with
respect to the use and/or levels of possible emissions from such chemicals and/or other substances, the Company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes. Any such changes could have a material adverse
effect on the financial statements of the Company.

Another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity
of global weather conditions. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, United Kingdom and Ireland. In addition, the Company manufactures a growing percentage of its HPLC, UPLC and MS products in both Singapore
and Wexford, Ireland. Severe weather conditions, including earthquakes, hurricanes and/or tsunamis, could potentially cause significant damage to the Company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries. The effects of such damage and
the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the Company.

Compliance failures could harm the Company’s business.

The Company is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including, among others, health and safety, import/export, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
and environmental laws and regulations. A portion of the Company’s operations are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities, including
design, development, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. Any failure by the Company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls, the imposition of fines, restrictions on the
Company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations.

Some of
the Company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing, handling, use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances. This requires the Company to devote substantial resources to
maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations. If the Company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products, it could face civil and/or criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited
from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant.

Some of the Company’s products are also subject to
the rules of certain industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization. The Company must comply with these rules, as well as those of other agencies, such as the United States Occupational Health and Safety
Administration. Failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification and/or the imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations.

The Company is subject to the rules of the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requiring disclosure
as to whether certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which may be contained in the Company’s products are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. These rules are likely
to impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the Company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products.

The Company operates more than one field office within certain states and foreign countries.

Item 3:

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company
believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters



and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. In June 2012, a $3 million payment was
made to settle a complaint that was filed against the Company alleging patent infringement.

The Company has been engaged in
ongoing patent litigation with Agilent Technologies GmbH (“Agilent”) in Germany. In July 2005, Agilent brought an action against the Company alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump continued to infringe certain of its patents.
In August 2006, following a trial in this action, the German court ruled that the Company did not infringe the patents. Agilent filed an appeal in this action. A hearing on this appeal was held in January 2008. The appeals court affirmed the finding
of the trial court that the Company did not infringe and Agilent appealed this finding to the German Federal Court of Justice. In December 2012, Agilent won this appeal and the Company recorded a $4 million provision for damages and fees estimated
to be incurred in connection with this litigation.

Item 7:

Management’s

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business and Financial Overview

The Company has two operating
segments: the Waters Division and the TA Division (“TA

®

”). The Waters Division’s products and
services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC

®

” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products
and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, life science, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental,
academic and governmental customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability of fine chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, water, polymers and viscous liquids in consumer goods and healthcare products.



The Company’s operating results are as follows for the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010:

Sales were flat in 2012 as compared to 2011, as a 4% increase in combined sales of
chemistry consumables and services was offset by a 4% decrease in instrument system sales. The increase in service sales was from higher renewal rates of service plans, as well as higher service demand billings from the Company’s installed base
of customers. The decline in instrument system sales was generally attributable to timing of capital spending by our customers across all regions, except China, as a result of uncertain global economic conditions and the weakening of both the Euro,
which impacted sales due to the effect of foreign currency translation, and Indian rupee, which effectively increased the price of the systems for certain customers. The effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted 2012 sales by 2%
across all products and services. The 2011 increase in sales of 13% as compared to 2010 was attributable to increased spending by the Company’s pharmaceutical, industrial and chemical analysis customers on new and existing LC, MS and TA
products. The sales growth in 2011 was also attributable to an increase in demand for the ACQUITY UPLC

®

H-Class,
Xevo

®

, Xevo

®

TQ-S and SYNAPT

®

G2-S
instrument systems. The effect of foreign currency translation increased sales by 3% in 2011 and had minimal impact on 2010 sales.

Sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 1% and 13% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in 2012 was primarily a result of increased spending on chemistry consumables and services. The increase
in 2011 was due to increased sales of instrument systems, particularly ACQUITY UPLC H-Class, Xevo Q-Tof, Xevo TQ-S and SYNAPT G2-S instrument systems, and chemistry consumables and services. Combined sales to industrial and environmental customers
decreased 2% in 2012 and increased 15% in 2011. Combined global sales to governmental and academic customers decreased 4% in 2012 and increased 5% in 2011. The decreases in 2012 sales were primarily attributable to timing of capital spending by our
customers as a result of uncertain global economic conditions and the weakening of the Euro and Indian rupee, while the increases in 2011 were primarily attributable to sales of newly introduced LC and LC-MS systems as global economic conditions
improved as compared to 2010.



The 3% decrease in operating income in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to
one-time charges included in purchased intangibles amortization and litigation provisions and the effects of foreign currency translation. Included in purchased intangibles amortization in 2012 is $4 million of amortization expense related to the
discontinuance of a product trade name intangible asset. The Company recorded $7 million of litigation provisions in 2012 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with complaints filed against the Company relating to patent
infringement lawsuits. The Company paid $3 million of these litigation provisions in 2012. Foreign currency translation decreased 2012 operating profit by approximately $14 million. The Company expects the impact of foreign currency translation in
2013 to have a neutral effect on sales but negatively impact operating profits when compared to 2012, based on current exchange rates. This is primarily due to the mix of sales and costs in Japan and Europe, where a weaker Japanese Yen is expected
to be offset by a stronger Euro.

The 17% increase in operating income in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily from
increases in sales volumes and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $26 million and $6 million of the increase in operating income in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Net income per diluted share was primarily impacted by the following factors in 2012, 2011 and 2010:

•

2011 and 2010 benefited from higher sales volumes, product mix and the leveraging of lower growth in operating expenses.

•

Foreign currency translation decreased net income per diluted share by $0.14 in 2012 and added $0.24 and $0.06 to net income per diluted share in 2011
and 2010, respectively.

•

In 2012, the Company refinanced certain of its inter-company debt arrangements, which enabled the Company to record a $36 million tax benefit related
to the recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with a non-U.S. net operating loss carryforward. In 2012, the Company also recorded a $6 million tax benefit related to a tax audit settlement in the U.S. These tax benefits added $0.48 per
diluted share in 2012.

•

In 2010, the Company recorded an $8 million tax benefit related to a tax audit settlement in the United Kingdom and a $2 million tax benefit related to
the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits added $0.10 per diluted share in 2010. The impact from the shift in pretax income between tax rate jurisdictions increased net income per diluted share by $0.14 in 2010 after
excluding this one-time transaction.

•

The impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from the Company’s share repurchase program, offset by the incremental interest
expense on borrowings to repurchase those shares, increased net income per diluted share $0.14, $0.01 and $0.06 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company plans to continue the share repurchase program in 2013.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $449 million, $497 million and $458 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The $48
million decrease in operating cash flow in 2012 when compared to 2011 was primarily a result of an increase of 7 days in days-sales-outstanding (“DSO”), payments in 2012 of amounts earned under the Company’s 2011 management incentive
plans, higher U.S. tax payments and a $3 million litigation payment. The increase in operating cash flow in 2011 when compared to 2010 was primarily a result of higher net income and was also impacted by the payment in 2011 of amounts earned under
the Company’s 2010 management incentive plans.

Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures
related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization were $105 million, $85 million and $63 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Capital expenditures were higher in 2012 and 2011 due to a multi-year project to consolidate
certain existing primary MS research, manufacturing and distribution locations. As of December 31, 2012, the Company has spent a total of $52 million related to this project and expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the
range of $25 million to $50 million to finish construction of this facility.



In 2012, the Company acquired three businesses, its Israeli sales and service distributor,
Baehr Thermoanalyse GmbH (“Baehr”) and Blue Reference, Inc., for a total of $31 million, net of cash acquired and including the assumption of $1 million of debt. Collectively, these acquisitions are expected to add approximately $13
million of sales in 2013 and be slightly accretive to earnings. The Company acquired Anter Corporation for $11 million in cash in 2011. The Company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to augment the
Waters and TA operating divisions.

Within cash flows used in financing activities, the Company received $29 million, $60
million and $101 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts were primarily attributable to changes in the Company’s stock price and the expiration of stock option grants. In May
2012, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $750 million of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company repurchased $290 million, $364 million and $292
million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under the May 2012 authorization and previously announced stock repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases
given current cash and debt levels, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits. In August 2012, as permitted by the credit agreement dated July 2011 (the “2011
Credit Agreement”), the Company increased the revolving facility commitment by $200 million, bringing the total amount of the revolving facility commitment to $900 million. There were no other changes to the terms and conditions of the 2011
Credit Agreement. The Company will use the proceeds from the increased revolving facility commitment for general corporate purposes.

Results of Operations

Sales by
Geography

Geographic sales information is presented below for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):

In 2012, sales were lower in all major regions, except for the U.S., which remained flat, and Asia, where
China’s sales grew 21% as compared to 2011. The sales growth in all regions in 2011 as compared to 2010 was attributable to increased spending by the Company’s pharmaceutical, industrial and chemical analysis customers on LC, MS and TA
products. The overall sales growth in Asia in 2012 was driven by China but was tempered by lower sales in India, mostly due to lower Alliance instrument systems sales as a weaker Indian rupee increased the price of these systems, which are priced in
U.S. dollars. The sales growth in China in 2012 can be attributed to strong customer demand in pharmaceutical, governmental, industrial and chemical analysis markets. The decline in Europe’s sales in 2012 was due to a 6% negative effect of
foreign currency translation. Europe’s 2011 sales benefited from strong demand from pharmaceutical and chemical analysis customers and the effect of foreign currency translation increased Europe’s sales by 5%. The decline in the rest of
the world’s sales in 2012



was due to lower demand of instrument systems from pharmaceutical, governmental and academic customers, while the 26% increase in the rest of the world’s sales in 2011 was primarily
attributable to strong customer demand of instrument systems across all markets. The Company anticipates demand for instrument systems to improve in 2013 across most major regions, with the exception of China, where the demand for instrument systems
is expected to continue at a double-digit growth rate.

Waters Division Net Sales

Net sales for the Waters Division’s products and services are as follows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):

Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) decreased 6% in 2012, which was primarily
attributable to the timing of capital spending by our customers as a result of uncertain global economic conditions and the weakening of both the Euro, which impacted sales due to the effect of foreign currency translation, and Indian rupee, which
effectively increased the price of the systems for certain customers. The 14% increase in instrument systems sales in 2011 was primarily attributable to higher demand from the Company’s pharmaceutical and industrial customers and the adoption
and uptake in sales from the ACQUITY UPLC H-Class, Xevo Q-Tof and Xevo TQ-S instrument systems. Chemistry consumables sales increased 1% in 2012, with the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacting chemistry consumables sales by 2%.
The 11% increase in chemistry consumables sales in 2011 was driven primarily by higher demand for chemistry consumable products, including increased sales of ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns, and by the bundling of chromatography columns with growing
LC system sales. Waters Division service sales increased 6% and 11% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, due to increased sales of service plans and higher service demand billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency
translation decreased Waters Division sales across all products and services by 2% in 2012 and increased sales 3% in 2011.

In
2012, Waters Division sales increased 3% in Asia, while sales were flat in the U.S and decreased 5% in Europe and 6% in the rest of the world. Asia experienced double-digit sales growth rates in China in 2012, particularly in the pharmaceutical,
governmental, industrial and chemical analysis markets. The 2012 growth in China was offset by a decline in capital expenditures by customers in India, mostly due to lower Alliance instrument systems sales as a weaker Indian rupee increased the
price of these systems, which are priced in U.S. dollars. The decline in Europe’s sales was due to a 6% negative effect of foreign currency translation.

In 2011, Waters Division sales in Europe increased 16%, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing Europe’s sales by 5%. Waters Division sales in Europe benefited from strong demand
for instrument systems from pharmaceutical and chemical analysis customers. Waters Division sales in Asia in 2011 increased 13% due to strong sales in China and a 4% increase due to the effects of foreign currency translation. In 2011, Waters
Division sales in the U.S. increased 5% and sales to the rest of the world increased 25%. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales in the rest of world in 2011.



TA Division Net Sales

Net sales for the TA Division’s products and services are as follows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):

The increase in TA instrument system sales in both 2012 and 2011 was primarily a result of higher demand
for instrument systems from TA’s industrial customers, as well as revenue associated with the shipment of the new Discovery instrument systems. TA service sales increased in both 2012 and 2011 due to sales of service plans and billings to a
higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased TA’s sales by 1% in 2012 and increased sales 3% in 2011. Recent acquisitions added approximately 4% to TA’s sales in 2012 and 1% in 2011. TA’s
2012 sales increased in the U.S., Europe and Asia, while sales to the rest of the world declined. TA’s sales increased in each territory in 2011.

Gross Profit

Gross profit decreased 1% in 2012 as compared to 2011, while gross profit as
a percentage of sales decreased from 60.5% to 60.0%, primarily due to changes in instrument systems product mix and the negative effects of foreign currency translation. Gross profit increased 13% in 2011 as compared to 2010, while gross profit as a
percentage of sales increased from 60.2% to 60.5%, due to sales volume leveraging manufacturing fixed costs and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, price, product
mix, foreign currency translation and product costs of instrument systems and associated software platforms. The cost and amortization of capitalized software development costs for the Company’s recently introduced ACQUITY

®

UPC

2™

and UNIFI

®

products may affect the Company’s product mix and associated gross profit in 2013. The Company also expects that the impact of foreign currency translation will
negatively affect gross profit, based on current exchange rates.

Selling and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses decreased 3% in 2012 and increased 10% in 2011. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses in 2012 was a
result of the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and lower incentive compensation in 2012 as compared to 2011. The increase in selling and administrative expenses in 2011 was a result of the Company’s investment in headcount
additions, principally in sales and service; higher merit and fringe benefit costs; higher sales and incentive compensation costs; and foreign currency translation. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 25.9% for
2012 compared to 26.5% for 2011 and 27.1% for 2010. The Company expects selling and administrative expenses to increase in 2013 as a result of headcount additions and acquisitions in 2012, as well as restored incentive compensation levels, based on
projected 2013 results.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased 4% and 10% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, primarily due to additional headcount and development costs incurred on new products.

Purchased Intangibles Amortization

In
2012, the Company incurred a one-time $4 million charge to purchased intangibles amortization expense related to the discontinuance of a product trade name intangible asset.



Litigation Provision

The Company recorded $7 million of litigation provisions in 2012 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with complaints filed against the Company relating to patent infringement
lawsuits. The Company paid $3 million of these litigation provisions in 2012.

Interest Expense

The increases in net interest expense in 2012 and 2011 were primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings, as well as higher interest rates
paid on fixed-rate debt.

Provision for Income Taxes

The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the United Kingdom and Singapore, where the marginal effective tax rates are approximately 37.5%, 12.5%, 23.25%
and 0%, respectively. The Company has a contractual tax rate in Singapore of 0% through March 2016, based upon achievement of contractual milestones that the Company expects to continue to meet. The current statutory tax rate in Singapore is 17%.
The Company’s effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors, including, but not limited to, the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates; sales volumes and profit levels in each tax
jurisdiction; changes in tax laws, tax rates and policies; the outcome of various ongoing tax audit examinations; and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation. As a result of variability in these factors, the Company’s
effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the effective tax rates for the current or prior year.

The
Company’s effective tax rates were 5.4%, 15.0% and 12.8% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The income tax provision for 2012 included a $36 million tax benefit related to the Company’s refinancing of certain of its inter-company debt
arrangements, which enabled the Company to recognize a deferred tax asset associated with a non-U.S. net operating loss carryforward. In 2012, the Company also recorded a $6 million tax benefit related to a tax audit settlement in the U.S. These tax
benefits decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 8.6 percentage points in 2012. Included in the income tax provision for 2011 is a $2 million tax benefit related to the reversal of a reserve for interest related to a tax audit settlement
in the United Kingdom. This tax benefit decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 0.3 percentage points in 2011. Included in the 2010 income tax provision was an $8 million tax benefit related to a tax audit settlement in the United Kingdom
and $2 million of tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points in 2010. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates
for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were primarily attributable to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates.

On January 2, 2013, the U.S. enacted legislation that retroactively extended the research and development tax credit (“R&D
Tax Credit”) for two years, from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. The Company expects that its income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include the entire benefit of the R&D Tax Credit attributable to
2012, which is estimated to be approximately $2 million, and the first quarter of 2013. The Company will continue to record the benefit of the R&D Tax Credit in subsequent quarters in 2013.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):

Cash Flow from Operating Activities

Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $449 million and $497 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 as compared to 2011 include the following significant changes in the sources
and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase in net income:

•

The increases in net income and deferred income taxes in 2012 were primarily attributable to a $36 million tax benefit related to the Company’s
refinancing of certain of its inter-company debt arrangements, which enabled the Company to recognize a deferred tax asset associated with a non-U.S. net operating loss carryforward.

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales in
2012 as compared to 2011. DSO was 71 days at December 31, 2012 and 64 days December 31, 2011.

•

The 2012 change in inventories was primarily attributable to the increase in inventory related to new products expected to be launched in 2013.

•

The 2012 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was impacted by an increase in accrued income taxes, which was offset by higher U.S.
tax payments. In addition, accounts payable and other current liabilities was impacted by lower levels of incentive compensation earned in 2012 as compared to 2011, as well as the payment of the 2011 incentive compensation in 2012 and timing of
payments to vendors.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2012 and 2011 was a result of an increase in new service contracts, as well as a
higher installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts.

•

Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and
other liabilities.



Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010

Net cash provided by operating activities was $497 million and $458 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The changes within net cash provided by
operating activities in 2011 when compared to 2010 include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase in net income:

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and higher sales volumes
in 2011 as compared to 2010. DSO was 64 days at December 31, 2011 and 67 days at December 31, 2010.

•

The 2011 change in inventories was attributable to the increase in inventory related to the introduction of new products and associated spare parts
launched in 2011.

•

The 2011 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was a result of timing of payments to vendors and a decrease in income taxes payable
in the current year as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. The 2010 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was a result of increases in accounts payable and accrued income taxes.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2011 and 2010 was a result of the higher installed base of customers renewing
annual service contracts.

•

Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and
other liabilities.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $296 million, $356 million and $412 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $105 million, $85
million and $63 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Capital expenditures were higher in 2012 and 2011 due to a multi-year project to consolidate certain existing primary MS research, manufacturing and distribution locations. As of
December 31, 2012, the Company has spent a total of $52 million related to this project and expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $25 million to $50 million to finish construction of this facility.

During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company purchased $1,816 million, $1,749 million and $1,235 million of short-term
investments, respectively, while $1,655 million, $1,490 million and $886 million of short-term investments matured, respectively. Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $31 million and $11 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively. There
were no business acquisitions in 2010.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

In August 2012, as permitted by the 2011 Credit Agreement, the Company increased the revolving facility commitment by $200 million, bringing the total amount of the revolving facility commitment to $900
million. There were no other changes to the terms and conditions of the 2011 Credit Agreement. The term loan facility and the revolving facility both mature on July 28, 2016 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date.

The interest rates applicable to the 2011 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate (which is the
highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 1/2%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the
Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 20 basis points and between 85 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. The facility fees on these credit agreements range between 15 basis points and 30 basis points. These credit
agreements require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the credit
agreement includes negative covenants,



affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of December 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance
with all such covenants.

The Company issued and sold senior unsecured notes with a face value of $200 million in both 2011
and 2010. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. Interest on both issuances of senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually. The Company
may redeem some of the notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make-whole amount. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company
comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary
negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default.

During 2012, 2011 and 2010,
the Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $186 million, $225 million and $134 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had a total of $1,178 million in outstanding debt, which consisted of $400 million in
outstanding notes, $300 million borrowed under a term loan facility under the 2011 Credit Agreement, $470 million borrowed under revolving credit facility under the 2011 Credit Agreement and $8 million borrowed under various other short-term lines
of credit. At December 31, 2012, $125 million of the outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets due to the fact that the Company expects to utilize this
portion of the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. It is the Company’s intention to pay the short-term portions of the outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months following the
respective period end date. The remaining $345 million of the outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, as no repayments are required prior to the maturity date
in 2016 and this portion is not expected to be repaid within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under existing credit agreements of $428 million after outstanding letters of
credit.

In May 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $750 million of its
outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company repurchased 3.5 million, 4.5 million and 4.4 million shares at a cost of $290 million, $364 million and $292 million, respectively, under the May
2012 authorization and previously announced programs. As of September 29, 2012, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 6.0 million shares of its common stock under the now expired share repurchase program authorized in February 2011 for
an aggregate cost of $497 million. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had purchased an aggregate of 1.3 million shares at a cost of $107 million under the May 2012 program, leaving $643 million authorized for future repurchases. In
addition, the Company repurchased $6 million, $6 million and $4 million of common stock during 2012, 2011 and 2010 related to the vesting of restricted stock units.

The Company received $29 million, $60 million and $101 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan in
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,539 million as of
December 31, 2012. The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are generated from foreign operations, with $1,489 million held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2012. Due to the fact that most
of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held outside of the U.S., the Company must manage and maintain sufficient levels of cash flow in the U.S. to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt and
interest, finance potential U.S. acquisitions and continue to repurchase shares under the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S. These U.S. cash requirements are funded primarily by the Company’s cash flow from U.S. operations and the
use of the Company’s revolving credit facilities.



Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position,
particularly in the U.S., along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends, the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities will be sufficient to
service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation and tax audit examinations. In addition, there have been
no recent significant changes to the Company’s financial position, nor are there any anticipated changes, to warrant a material adjustment related to indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.

Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 20 basis points and between 85 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. The facility fee on the 2011 Credit Agreement ranges between 15 basis points and 30 basis points. The 2011
Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2011

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current
litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10-K.



The Company has long-term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension
and supplemental executive retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether the employee elects lump-sum or
annuity payments. During fiscal year 2013, the Company expects to contribute approximately $8 million to $10 million to the Company’s defined benefit plans.

In order to accommodate future sales growth, the Company purchased land in the United Kingdom in 2011 to consolidate certain existing primary MS research, manufacturing and distribution locations in the
United Kingdom into one facility. As of December 31, 2012, the Company has spent a total of $52 million related to this project and expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $25 million to $50 million to finish
construction of this facility. The Company believes it can fund the construction of this facility with cash flows from operating activities and its borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities.

The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which
require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of
the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. If all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2012 were to become
recognizable in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of approximately $64 million in its income tax provision.

The Company’s uncertain tax positions are taken with respect to income tax return reporting periods beginning after December 31, 1999, which are the periods that generally remain open to income
tax audit examination by the concerned income tax authorities. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net
interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.

The Company is currently engaged in continuing
communications with tax authorities in the U.S., Japan and various other jurisdictions regarding examinations of the Company’s tax returns related to matters for which the Company has previously recorded uncertain tax benefits. During 2012, the
Company did not record any material changes in the measurement of any unrecognized tax benefits related to these ongoing tax audit examinations. As of December 31, 2012, the Company anticipates that it will be able to resolve certain of these
ongoing tax audit examinations during the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2012, the Company expects to record a reduction in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties in the range of
approximately $5 million to $39 million within the next twelve months due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments and the settlement of ongoing tax audit examinations, and does not otherwise expect to record any other
material changes within the next twelve months. These amounts have been classified as accrued income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has not created, and is not party to, any
special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated
financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material
continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company
indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for



losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement
claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future
payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management
accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Summary

The preparation
of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies
are those that are central to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an ongoing basis, the Company
evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Company’s
consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Revenue Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. The Company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of
the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to shipment of the instrument. At December 31, 2012, the Company had current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities of $121 million and
$23 million, respectively. Revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility
is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales, net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order.

Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until
a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. The Company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company structures its sales
arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue upon shipment. In some cases, destination based shipping terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue is generally recognized when
the products arrive at the customer site.

The Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring
installation is in accordance with multiple-element revenue recognition accounting standards. With respect to the installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the best estimate of selling price of the installation service
is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the best estimate of selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including
hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties.



Instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance
period. The amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed.
No revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Sales of software are accounted for in
accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition. The Company’s software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts. Software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable, and there are no significant post-delivery obligations remaining. The revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized
ratably over the maintenance term. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. The Company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction
includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered element (maintenance) is deferred and the remaining portion of the
arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element (software license) and is recognized as revenue.

Loss Provisions on Accounts
Receivable and Inventory

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request
collateral from its customers, but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, past transaction history
with the customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro-economic environment. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product
returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful
accounts. The Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2012 was $405 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $8 million.

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis (“FIFO”). The Company
estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand, including that in the Company’s current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. If actual future
demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. The Company’s inventory balance at December 31, 2012 was recorded at its net realizable value of $230 million,
which is net of write-downs of $18 million.

Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, particularly as it pertains to capitalized software and
patent costs;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends, competitive products and technologies; and

•

significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Company’s capitalized patents,
purchased technology, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses.



When the Company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset,
long-lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill, including its
eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is written-down to its
estimated fair value. Net intangible assets, long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $220 million, $273 million and $317 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2012.

The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on January 1 of each year. For goodwill impairment review purposes,
the Company has two reporting units, the Waters Division and TA Division. The Company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future; however, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are
completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. The factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

significant decline in the Company’s projected revenue, earnings or cash flows;

•

significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate;

•

significant decline in the Company’s stock price or the stock price of comparable companies;

•

adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and

•

unanticipated competition.

Warranty

Product warranties are
recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the
Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from
the Company’s previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2012, the Company’s warranty liability was $12 million.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements,
the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting
from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance
sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position
and results of operations.

The accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the
necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the Company accounts for
its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standards, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption
that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. At
December 31, 2012, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $64 million, $39 million of which are classified as current liabilities and $25 million of which are classified as long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.



Litigation

As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10-K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management
determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably
estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to
considerable uncertainty.

With respect to the specific claims referenced in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this
Form 10-K, management of the Company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to those claims. As developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available, management of the
Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording additional charges which could materially impact the Company’s results of operations or financial position.

Pension and Other Retirement Benefits

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Company’s pension plans and other retirement
benefits are evaluated periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets, are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.12% for its U.S. benefit plans and 1.88% for its non-U.S. benefit plans.

At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could
be effectively settled. The Company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer Pension Discount Curve for high quality investments as of December 31, 2012 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows
for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once the interest rates were determined, the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. At December 31, 2012, the Company determined the
weighted-average discount rate to be 3.90% for the U.S. benefit plans and 3.10% for the non-U.S. benefits plans.

A
one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one-quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate
of return would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million.

Stock-based Compensation

The accounting
standards for stock-based compensation require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company has used the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock
option awards. Under the fair-value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair
value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense
and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of the expense
has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. These accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are
estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards, the compensation expense that



the Company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution
method.

As of December 31, 2012, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted-average lives over which the costs
will be amortized were as follows (in millions):

Recent Accounting Standard Changes and Developments

Information regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this document and should
be considered an integral part of this Item 7. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards.

Item 7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and
interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Company’s overall risk management guidelines.

The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange-rate risk with respect to certain inter-company balances, forecasted transactions
and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into
account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations.

The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
The Company’s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered into interest
rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount.

Derivative Transactions

The Company
records its derivative transactions in accordance with the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establish the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities.
If the derivative is designated as a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item



affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. In addition, disclosures required for derivative instruments and hedging activities include the
Company’s objectives for using derivative instruments, the level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company’s financial position and performance.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risks. The Company’s
objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency exposures. The Company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged
items and links all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions. In addition, the Company considers the impact
of its counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis,
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter-company balances and short-term assets and liabilities. Principal
hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts, which are intended to be consistent with changes
in the underlying exposures. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company held forward foreign
exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $134 million, $161 million and $136 million, respectively.

The
Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands):

December 31,


December 31,


Other current assets

$

1,173

$


Other current liabilities

$


$

1,317

The following is a summary of the activity in the statements of operations related to the forward foreign
exchange contracts (in thousands):

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the
U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2012 would decrease pre-tax earnings by approximately $13 million.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with
original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in bank deposits, U.S. and U.K. treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper. Investments with longer maturities are classified as short-term investments, and are held primarily in U.S.
treasury bills, Canadian government U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits



and investment-grade commercial paper. The Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other
than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, $1,489 million out of $1,539 million and $1,200 million out of $1,281 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
were held by foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to material tax effects on distribution to U.S. legal entities. As of December 31, 2012, the Company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured
investment vehicles.

The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are not subject to significant
interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of December 31, 2012, the carrying value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value.



Item 8:

Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1    Description of Business and Organization

Waters Corporation (“Waters

®

” or the “Company”) is an analytical instrument manufacturer that primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters Division, high
performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC

®

”
and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These
systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using a common software platform and are used along with other analytical instruments. LC is a standard technique
and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS instruments are used in drug discovery and
development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and
separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. Through its TA Division
(“TA

®

”), the Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry
and calorimetry instruments, which are used in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research.
The Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument system.

2    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, product returns and allowances, bad debts, inventory valuation, equity
investments, goodwill and intangible assets, warranty and installation provisions, income taxes, contingencies, litigation, retirement plan obligations and stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial
market conditions, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, dependence on key
personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly owned. The Company consolidates
entities in which it owns or controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Translation of Foreign Currencies

For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are
translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s net sales derived from
operations outside the United States were 71% in 2012, 71% in 2011 and 70% in 2010. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for the years
presented.

Seasonality of Business

The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year
end.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in bank deposits, U.S. and U.K. treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper.
Investments with longer maturities are classified as short-term investments, and are held primarily in U.S. treasury bills, Canadian government U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and investment-grade
commercial paper.

Short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale in accordance with the accounting standards for
investments in debt and equity securities. All available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair market value and any unrealized holding gains and losses, to the extent deemed temporary, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity, net of the related tax effects. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment, the Company considers all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is “other
than temporary” and marks the investment to market through a charge to the statement of operations. The Company classifies its investments as short-term investments exclusive of those categorized as cash equivalents. At December 31, 2012
and 2011, the Company had short-term investments with a cost of $1,058 million and $897 million, respectively, which approximated market value.

The Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2012
and 2011, $1,489 million out of $1,539 million and $1,200 million out of $1,281 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to material tax
effects on distribution to U.S. legal entities.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the
amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number of factors, including historical experience and the customer’s credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on at
least a quarterly basis. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged against the allowance when the Company feels it is probable that the receivable will
not be recovered. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for doubtful
accounts and sales returns for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products and services to a significant number of large and small customers throughout the world, with net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately 53% in 2012, 52% in
2011 and 52% in 2010. None of the Company’s individual customers accounted for more than 3% of annual Company sales in 2012, 2011 or 2010. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral, but in certain circumstances may require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

Inventory

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a
first-in, first-out basis (“FIFO”).

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Appropriate short-term and long-term liabilities have also been recorded to recognize uncertain tax return reporting positions.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense,
while the costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings — fifteen to thirty years; building improvements — five to
ten years; leasehold improvements — the shorter of the economic useful life or life of lease; and production and other equipment — three to ten years. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated balance sheets and related gains or losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no material gains or losses from retirement or sale of assets in 2012,
2011 and 2010.

Asset Impairments

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment. Whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the fair value of the asset, relying on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

flows. Any change in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of the Company’s evaluation is separately identified in the consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests for goodwill impairment using a fair-value approach at the reporting unit level annually, or earlier, if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additionally, the Company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment for its reporting units as of January 1 each
year. The goodwill and other intangible assets accounting standards define a reporting unit as an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by management. For goodwill
impairment review purposes, the Company has two reporting units, the Waters Division and TA Division. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition. Under the impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount
exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value of reporting units was estimated using a discounted cash flows
technique, which includes certain management assumptions, such as estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and discount rates.

The Company’s intangible assets include purchased technology; capitalized software development costs; costs associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as
licenses; debt issuance costs and acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”). Purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their estimated useful lives,
ranging from one to fifteen years. Other intangibles are amortized over a period ranging from one to thirteen years. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the related debt. Acquired IPR&D is amortized from the date of completion
over its estimated useful life. In addition, acquired IPR&D will be tested for impairment until completion of the acquired programs.

Software Development Costs

The Company
capitalizes internal and external software development costs for products offered for sale in accordance with the accounting standards for the costs of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. Capitalized costs are amortized to cost of
sales over the period of economic benefit, which approximates a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software products, generally three to five years. The Company capitalized $34 million and $29 million of direct
expenses that were related to the development of software in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Net capitalized software included in intangible assets totaled $138 million and $115 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, see
Note 6, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles”.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs for internal
use in accordance with the accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. Capitalized internal software development costs are amortized over the period of economic benefit which approximates a straight-line basis over ten years. Net
capitalized internal software included in property, plant and equipment totaled $3 million at both December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Investments

The Company accounts for
its investments that represent less than twenty percent ownership, and for which the Company does not have significant influence, using the accounting standards for investments in debt and equity securities. Investments for which the Company does
not have the ability to exercise significant influence, and for which there is not a readily determinable market value, are accounted for under the cost method of accounting.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
For investments in which the Company owns or controls between twenty and forty-nine percent of the voting shares, or over which it exerts significant influence over operating and financial policies, the equity method of accounting is used. The
Company’s share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in the consolidated statements of operations and was not material in any period presented. All investments at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are included in other assets
and amounted to $3 million and $4 million, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements

In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured
at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other
than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to
develop its own assumptions.

The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis at December 31, 2012 (in thousands):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2011 (in thousands):

The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, short-term investments, 401(k) restoration plan
assets and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued,
typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic
events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. After completing these validation procedures, the Company did not adjust or
override any fair value measurements provided by third-party pricing services as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments

The Company’s cash, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $400 million at both December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The
fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt is estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed
interest rate debt was $413 million and $410 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.

Derivative
Transactions

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates.

The Company records its derivative
transactions in accordance with the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establish the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. All



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is
designated as a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. In addition,
disclosures required for derivative instruments and hedging activities include the Company’s objectives for using derivative instruments, the level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as how derivative instruments and related
hedged items affect the Company’s financial position and performance.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments
to manage exposures to foreign currency risks. The Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency exposures. The Company
documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific
forecasted transactions. In addition, the Company considers the impact of its counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts. The Company also assesses and
documents, both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
certain inter-company balances and short-term assets and liabilities. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and
have varying notional amounts, which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying exposures. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations. At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $134 million, $161 million and $136 million, respectively.

Stockholders’ Equity

In May 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $750 million of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company
repurchased 3.5 million, 4.5 million and 4.4 million shares at a cost of $290 million, $364 million and $292 million, respectively, under the May 2012 authorization and previously announced programs. As of December 31, 2012, the
Company repurchased an aggregate of 6.0 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of $497 million under the February 2011 repurchase program, which is now expired. During 2012, the Company repurchased 1.3 million shares at a
cost of $107 million under the May 2012 repurchase program, leaving $643 million authorized for future purchases. In addition, the Company repurchased $6 million, $6 million and $4 million of common stock during 2012, 2011 and 2010 related to the
vesting of restricted stock units. The Company believes it has the resources to fund the common stock repurchases as well as to pursue acquisition opportunities in the future.

Revenue Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product
shipment and performance of service, respectively. The Company’s deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to shipment of the
instrument. Revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably
assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales, net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order.

Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenue until a valid
purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. The Company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company structures its sales
arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue upon shipment. In some cases, destination based shipping terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue is generally recognized when
the products arrive at the customer site.

The Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring
installation is in accordance with the multiple-element revenue recognition accounting standards. With respect to the installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the best estimate of selling price of the installation
service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the best estimate of selling price of installation based upon a number of factors,
including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties.

Instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period. The amount of the service contract is
amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. No revenue is recognized until all revenue
recognition criteria have been met.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for
software revenue recognition. The Company’s software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts. Software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred,
the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable, and there are no significant post-delivery obligations remaining. The revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the maintenance term. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. The Company uses the residual method to
allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered element (maintenance) is
deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element (software license) and recognized as revenue.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales arrangements. Revenue associated with products that contain specific
customer acceptance criteria is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. Discounts from list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales.

Product Warranty Costs

The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of
sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component
supplies, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical
information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the years ended December 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010 (in thousands):

Advertising Costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expenses for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were
$13 million, $11 million and $10 million, respectively.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and benefits,
facilities costs, overhead costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company
has two stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 11, “Stock-Based Compensation”.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Earnings Per Share

In accordance with the earnings per share accounting standards, the Company presents two earnings per share (“EPS”) amounts. Income per basic common share is based on income available to common
shareholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Income per diluted common share includes additional dilution from potential common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of
stock options outstanding.

Comprehensive Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with the accounting standards for comprehensive income, which establish the accounting rules for reporting and displaying comprehensive income.
These standards require that all components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements.

Subsequent Events

The Company did not have any material subsequent events.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In June 2011, a new accounting standard was issued relating to the presentation of comprehensive income. The adoption of this standard did not have a
material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2011, amended
accounting guidance was issued for goodwill in order to simplify how companies test goodwill for impairment. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In July 2012, amended accounting guidance was issued for indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill in order to simplify how companies test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
This guidance is effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to
have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

3    Inventories

Inventories are classified as follows (in thousands):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

4    Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):

During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company retired and disposed of approximately $6 million,
$6 million and $9 million of property, plant and equipment, respectively, most of which was fully depreciated and no longer in use. Gains and losses on disposal were immaterial.

5    Acquisitions

The Company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations and the results of each
acquisition have been included in the Company’s consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates.

In July
2012, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Blue Reference, Inc. (“Blue Reference”), a U.S.-based developer and distributor of software products used for the real-time mining and analysis of multiple-application
scientific databases, for $14 million in cash. The Company will integrate the Blue Reference technology into the current and future software product platforms to further differentiate its offerings by providing customers with a more efficient
scientific information assessment process, where there is an ongoing need for immediacy and interactivity of multiple scientific databases. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities
based on their estimated fair values. The Company has allocated $8 million of the purchase price to intangible assets comprised of completed technology and $1 million to customer relationships and other intangibles. The Company is amortizing
acquired technology over seven years and the customer relationships and other intangibles over five years. The remaining purchase price of $8 million has been accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

In February 2012, the Company acquired the net assets of its Israeli sales and service distributor for $6 million in cash. The Company
has allocated $2 million of the purchase price to intangible assets comprised of customer relationships. The Company is amortizing the customer relationships over ten years. The remaining purchase price of $4 million has been accounted for as
goodwill. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

In January 2012, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital
stock of Baehr Thermoanalyse GmbH (“Baehr”), a German manufacturer of a wide range of thermal analyzers, for $12 million in cash, including the assumption of $1 million of debt. Baehr was acquired to expand TA’s thermal analysis
instrument product offering and to leverage the Company’s distribution channels. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The Company has
allocated $4 million of the purchase price to intangible assets comprised of completed technology and $1 million to customer relationships and other intangibles. The Company is amortizing the customer relationships and the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

acquired technology over ten years. The remaining purchase price of $7 million has been accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The following table presents the fair values, as determined by the Company, of 100% of the assets and liabilities owned and recorded in
connection with the acquisitions of Blue Reference, the Israeli sales and service distributor and Baehr (in thousands):

In July 2011, the Company acquired the net assets of Anter Corporation (“Anter”), a
manufacturer of thermal analyzers used to measure thermal expansion and shrinkage, thermal conductivity and resistivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat capacity of a wide range of materials, for $11 million in cash. Anter was acquired to
expand TA’s thermal analysis instrument product offering and to leverage the Company’s distribution channels. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their
estimated fair values. The Company has allocated $4 million of the purchase price to intangible assets comprised of customer relationships and acquired technology. The Company is amortizing the customer relationships over six years and the acquired
technology over ten years. These intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average period of nine years. The remaining purchase price of $6 million has been accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

The principal factor that resulted in recognition of goodwill in these acquisitions is that the purchase price was based in
part on cash flow projections assuming the integration of any acquired technology, distribution channels and products with the Company’s products, which is of considerably greater value than utilizing each of the acquired companies’
technology, customer access or products on a stand-alone basis. The goodwill also includes value assigned to assembled workforce, which cannot be recognized as an intangible asset. In each acquisition, the sellers provided the Company with customary
representations, warranties and indemnification, which would be settled in the future if and when a breach of the contractual representation or warranty condition occurs. The acquisitions of Blue Reference, the Israeli sales and service distributor
and Baehr are expected to add approximately $13 million to the Company’s sales in 2013. The pro forma effect of the ongoing operations for Waters, Blue Reference, the Israeli sales and service distributor, Baehr and Anter as though these
acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the periods covered by this report is insignificant.

6    Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The carrying amount of goodwill was $317 million and $297 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The
Company’s acquisitions increased goodwill by $18 million (See Note 5) and the effect of foreign currency translation increased goodwill by $2 million in 2012.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s intangible assets included in the consolidated balance sheets are
detailed as follows (in thousands):

During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company acquired $16 million of purchased
intangibles as a result of the acquisitions of Blue Reference, an Israeli sales and service distributor and Baehr (Note 5). Amortization expense for intangible assets was $31 million, $30 million and $28 million for the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Included in amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 is a one-time $4 million charge to purchased intangibles amortization expense related to the discontinuance of a product trade name
intangible asset. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be between $40 million and $45 million per year for each of the next five years. The estimated significant increase in amortization expense is due to amortization
associated with capitalized software costs related to the launch of new software product platforms in the first quarter of 2013. The carrying value of the new software platform was approximately $102 million as of December 31, 2012 and will be
amortized over ten years.

7    Debt

In July 2011, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the “2011 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $700 million
revolving facility and a $300 million term loan facility. In August 2012, as provided for in the 2011 Credit Agreement, the Company increased the revolving facility commitment by $200 million, bringing the total amount of the revolving facility
commitment to $900 million. There were no other changes to the terms and conditions of the 2011 Credit Agreement. The Company will use the proceeds from the increased revolving facility commitment for general corporate purposes. The revolving
facility and term loan facility both mature on July 28, 2016 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date.

The
interest rates applicable to the 2011 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate (which is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 1/2%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR
rate plus 1%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 20 basis points and between 85 basis points and 120 basis
points, respectively. The facility fee on the 2011 Credit Agreement ranges between 15 basis points and 30 basis points. The 2011 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a
leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2011 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of
default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. At December 31, 2012, $125 million of the outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets due
to the fact that the Company expects to utilize this portion of the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs and can repay and re-borrow from the facility without penalty. The remaining $345 million of the outstanding portions of
the revolving facilities have been classified as long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, as no repayments are required prior to the maturity date in 2016 and this portion is not expected to be repaid within the next twelve months.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company issued and sold senior
unsecured notes with a face value of $200 million. As of both December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had a total of $400 million of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year.
The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the
note purchase agreement) of the Company, the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These notes require that the Company comply with an
interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, these notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative
covenants, representations and warranties and events of default.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance
with all debt covenants.

The Company had the following outstanding debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had a total amount available to borrow of $428 million
and $419 million, respectively, after outstanding letters of credit, under the 2011 Credit Agreement. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and 2011 Credit Agreement borrowings collectively were 2.11% and 2.33%
at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term
lines of credit totaling $107 million and $109 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the weighted-average interest
rates applicable to the short-term borrowings were 2.00% and 2.02%, respectively.

8    Income Taxes

Income tax data for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows (in thousands):

The Company’s effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were
5.4%, 15.0% and 12.8%, respectively. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2012 included a $36 million tax benefit related to the Company’s refinancing of certain of its inter-company debt arrangements, which enabled the
Company to recognize a deferred tax asset associated with a non-U.S. net operating loss carryforward. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company also recorded a $6 million tax benefit related to a tax audit settlement in the U.S.
These tax benefits decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 8.6 percentage points in the year ended December 31, 2012. Included in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2011 is $2 million of tax benefit related
to the reversal of reserves for interest related to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom. This tax benefit decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 0.3 percentage points in the year ended December 31, 2011. Included in the income
tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2010 is an $8 million tax benefit related to a tax audit settlement in the United Kingdom and



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$2 million of tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre-acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points in the year
ended December 31, 2010. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were primarily attributable to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different
effective tax rates.

The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards which give rise to deferred tax assets and
deferred tax (liabilities) are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Net deferred tax assets of $51 million and $56 million are included in other current assets and
$69 million and $24 million are included in other assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards and the related valuation allowance increased due to the aforementioned tax benefit related to the Company’s refinancing of inter-company debt arrangements. This deferred tax asset was established for $111 million, for which a $75
million valuation allowance was established and a $36 million tax benefit was recorded in the income tax provision. The Company’s net deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are approximately $35
million as of December 31, 2012, which represent the future tax benefit of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that do not expire under current law.

The income tax benefits associated with non-qualified stock option compensation expense recognized for tax purposes and credited to additional paid-in capital were $11 million, $32 million and
$11 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

At December 31, 2012, there
were unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $2 billion. The Company has not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on these earnings as it is the Company’s current intention to permanently
reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. Because of the complexity



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of U.S. and foreign tax rules applicable to the distribution of earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. legal entities, the determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these
earnings is not practicable.

The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the
accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of those tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax
reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of those unrecognized tax benefits for the time value of money.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):

The Company’s uncertain tax positions are taken with respect to income tax return reporting periods
beginning after December 31, 1999, which are the periods that generally remain open to income tax audit examination by the concerned income tax authorities. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential
tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company reclassified $39 million of
its unrecognized tax benefits to short-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, leaving $25 million classified as long-term liabilities.

The Company is currently engaged in continuing communications with tax authorities in the U.S., Japan and various other jurisdictions regarding examinations of the Company’s tax returns related to
matters for which the Company has previously recorded uncertain tax benefits. During 2012, the Company did not record any material changes in the measurement of any unrecognized tax benefits related to these ongoing tax audit examinations. As of
December 31, 2012, the Company anticipates that it will be able to resolve certain of these ongoing tax audit examination processes during the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2012, the Company expects to record a reduction in the
measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties in the range of approximately $5 million to $39 million within the next twelve months due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments and
the settlement of ongoing tax audit examinations, and does not otherwise expect to record any other material changes within the next twelve months. These amounts have been classified as accrued income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets.

9    Litigation

The Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes the outcome of
these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2012, a $3 million payment was made to settle a complaint that was filed against the Company alleging patent
infringement.

The Company has been engaged in ongoing patent litigation with Agilent Technologies GmbH (“Agilent”)
in Germany. In July 2005, Agilent brought an action against the Company alleging that certain features of the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Alliance pump continued to infringe certain of its patents. In August 2006, following a trial in this action, the German court ruled that the Company did not infringe the patents. Agilent filed
an appeal in this action. A hearing on this appeal was held in January 2008. The appeals court affirmed the finding of the trial court that the Company did not infringe and Agilent appealed this finding to the German Federal Court of Justice. In
December 2012, Agilent won this appeal and the Company recorded a $4 million provision for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with this litigation. The accrued patent litigation expense is in other current liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

10    Other Commitments and Contingencies

Lease agreements, expiring at various dates through 2026, cover buildings, office equipment and automobiles. Rental expense was $30
million, $28 million and $27 million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Future minimum rents payable as of December 31, 2012 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year are as
follows (in thousands):

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties. Fees paid for licenses were less
than $1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2012 are immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2013 and
thereafter.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the
ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business.
Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection
with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the
Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.

11    Stock-Based Compensation

In May 2012, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (“2012 Plan”). As of
December 31, 2012, the 2012 Plan has 5.6 million shares available for grant in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of
awards. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock unit conversion. Under the 2012 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at
the date of grant. The 2012 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 9, 2022. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors and generally vest



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units may be
issued under the 2012 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards outstanding.

In May 2009, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible
employees may contribute up to 15% of their earnings toward the quarterly purchase of the Company’s common stock. The plan makes available 0.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock, which includes the remaining shares available
under the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2012, 1.1 million shares have been issued under both the 2009 and 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plans. Each plan period lasts three months beginning on January 1,
April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. The purchase price for each share of stock is the lesser of 90% of the market price on the first day of the plan period or 100% of the market price on the last day of the plan period.
Stock-based compensation expense related to this plan was $1 million, $1 million and less than $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which
require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The stock-based compensation accounting standards require
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly
from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation
expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period.

The consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock,
restricted stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands):

As of both December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company has capitalized stock-based compensation costs of
less than $1 million in inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company has capitalized stock-based compensation costs of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, in capitalized software in the
consolidated balance sheets.

Stock Options

In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value
of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected
volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of
non-qualified stock optionees. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant
data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:

The following table details the weighted-average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at
December 31, 2012 by range of exercise prices (in thousands, except per share data):

During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised (i.e., the
difference between the market price at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the options) was $31 million, $67 million and $45 million, respectively. The total cash received from the exercise of these stock options was $24
million, $56 million and $97 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The
aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding stock options at December 31, 2012 was $114 million. Options exercisable at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 2.9 million, 2.9 million and 3.7 million, respectively. The
weighted-average exercise prices of options exercisable at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $54.00, $47.95 and $43.45, respectively. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of the exercisable outstanding stock options at
December 31, 2012 was 4.3 years.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2012, the Company had 4.8 million stock options which are
vested and expected to vest. The intrinsic value, weighted-average price and remaining contractual life of the vested and expected to vest stock options were $114 million, $63.18 and 6.0 years, respectively, at December 31, 2012.

As of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, there were $45 million, $45 million and $38 million of total unrecognized
compensation costs related to unvested stock option awards that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.7 years.

Restricted Stock

During each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the
Company granted 12 thousand shares of restricted stock. The restrictions on these shares lapse at the end of a three-year period. The weighted-average fair value per share on the grant date of the restricted stock granted in 2012, 2011 and 2010
was $75.94, $78.10 and $61.63, respectively. The Company has recorded $1 million of compensation expense in each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to the restricted stock grants. As of December 31,
2012, the Company had 36 thousand unvested shares of restricted stock outstanding with a total of $1 million of unrecognized compensation costs. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.

Restricted Stock Units

The
following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the year ended December 31, 2012 (in thousands, except for per share amounts):

Restricted stock units are generally issued annually in February and vest in equal annual installments
over a five-year period. The amount of compensation costs recognized for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 on the restricted stock units expected to vest were $13 million, $13 million and $12 million, respectively. As of
December 31, 2012, there were $24 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the restricted stock unit awards that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
3.1 years.

12    Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company had 2.0 million,
1.3 million and 2.5 million stock options that were antidilutive, respectively, due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the period. These securities were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method.

13    Retirement Plans

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters Employee Investment Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution plan, immediately
upon hire. Employees may contribute from 1% to 30% of eligible pay on a pre-tax basis and the Company makes matching contributions of 100% for contributions up to 6% of eligible pay. Employees are 100% vested in employee and Company matching
contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s matching contributions amounted to $12 million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively.

The Company maintains two defined benefit plans in the U.S. for which the pay credit accruals have been frozen, the Waters Retirement
Plan and the Waters Retirement Restoration Plan (collectively, the “U.S. Pension Plans”). The Company also sponsors other employee benefit plans in the U.S., including a retiree healthcare plan, which provides reimbursement for medical
expenses and is contributory. There are various employee benefit plans outside the United States (both defined benefit and defined contribution plans). Certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans (“Non-U.S. Pension Plans”) are included in the
disclosures below, which are required under the accounting standards for retirement benefits.

During 2012, the Company
identified additional defined benefit pension plans in certain non-U.S. countries that had not historically been accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The cumulative impact of these plans was
(i) an understatement of the Company’s long-term pension liability of $6 million, an understatement of accumulated other comprehensive income of $4 million and an understatement of long-term deferred tax assets of $2 million and
(ii) an omission of pension disclosures in previous years that resulted in the 2012 projected benefit obligation and plan assets increasing $25 million and $18 million, respectively. The impact of these adjustments was reflected in the related
2012 fair value and other pension disclosures below.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company corrected the errors describe above through an out-of-period adjustment to
the consolidated balance sheet and statements of comprehensive income and stockholders’ equity during the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2012. The errors did not impact the Company’s consolidated statement of operations
or statement of cash flows. Management concluded that the adjustments described above to correct the cumulative effect of the omission of these plans were not material to the results for the first quarter of 2012 or for the year ended
December 31, 2012. In addition, management concluded that the omission of these plans was not material to any previously issued annual or quarterly financial statements, individually or in the aggregate.

The Company contributed $3 million, $2 million and $2 million in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to
the non-U.S. plans that were previously omitted from the required disclosures. The Company contributed $11 million, $10 million and $9 million in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to the remaining non-U.S. plans
(primarily defined contribution plans) which are currently outside of the scope of the required disclosures. The eligibility and vesting of non-U.S. plans are generally consistent with local laws and regulations.

The net periodic pension cost is made up of several components that reflect different aspects of the Company’s financial
arrangements as well as the cost of benefits earned by employees. These components are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method and are based on certain actuarial assumptions. The Company’s accounting policy is to
reflect in the projected benefit obligation all benefit changes to which the Company is committed as of the current valuation date; use a market-related value of assets to determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior service costs on a
straight-line basis over the expected future service of active participants as of the date such costs are first recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related value of plan assets
and the projected benefit obligation over the expected future service of active participants.

The asset allocation policy for the U.S. Pension Plans and U.S. retiree healthcare plan was
developed in consideration of the following long-term investment objectives: achieving a return on assets consistent with the investment policy, achieving portfolio returns which exceed the average return for similarly invested funds and maximizing
portfolio returns with at least a return of 2.5% above the one-year constant maturity Treasury bond yield over reasonable measurement periods and based on reasonable market cycles.

Within the equity portfolio of the U.S. retirement plans, investments are diversified among market capitalization and investment
strategy. The Company targets a 20% allocation of its U.S. retirement plans’ equity portfolio to be invested in financial markets outside of the United States. The Company does not invest in its own stock within the U.S. retirement
plans’ assets.

The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the pension cost at December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered historical
returns and future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio and historical expenses paid by the plan. A one-quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate of
return on assets would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Company’s net periodic
benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million.

During fiscal year 2013, the Company expects to
contribute a total of approximately $8 million to $10 million to the Company’s defined benefit plans. Estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):

14    Business Segment Information

The accounting standards for segment reporting establish standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual
financial statements and require selected information for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports of public business enterprises. They also establish standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas
and major customers. The Company’s business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision makers. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined
that it has two operating segments: Waters Division and TA Division.

Waters Division is primarily in the business of
designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. TA Division is primarily in the business of designing,
manufacturing, distributing and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two divisions are its operating segments and each has similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services;
types and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated

The Company’s unaudited quarterly results are summarized below (in thousands, except per share data):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a
result of purchasing habits for capital goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. Selling and administrative expenses are typically higher in the second and third quarters over the first quarter in each
year as the Company’s annual payroll merit increases take effect. Selling and administrative expenses will vary in the fourth quarter in relation to performance in the quarter and for the year. The Company recorded litigation provisions in the
second and fourth quarters of 2012 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with complaints filed against the Company relating to patent infringement lawsuits (Note 9). In the third quarter of 2012, the Company incurred a one-time
$4 million charge to purchased intangibles amortization expense related to the discontinuance of a product trade name intangible asset (Note 6). In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a $36 million tax benefit related to the reduction
in a deferred tax asset valuation reserve associated with the Company’s refinancing of certain of its inter-company debt arrangements, which enabled the Company to recognize a deferred tax asset associated with a non-U.S. net operating loss
carryforward (Note 8). In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company also recorded a $6 million tax benefit related to a tax audit settlement in the U.S. In the second quarter of 2011, the Company recorded $2 million of tax benefit related to the
reversal of reserves for interest related to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom.
