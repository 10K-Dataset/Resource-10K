INDEX



PART I

Item 1:

Business

General

Waters Corporation (“Waters” or the
    “Company”), an analytical instrument manufacturer,
    designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters
    Division, high performance liquid chromatography
    (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid
    chromatography

®

(“UPLC” and together with HPLC, herein referred to as
    “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”)
    instrument systems and support products, including
    chromatography columns, other consumable products and
    comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are
    complementary products that can be integrated together and used
    along with other analytical instruments. Through its TA Division
    (“TA”), the Company designs, manufactures, sells and
    services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry
    instruments. The Company is also a developer and supplier of
    software based products that interface with the Company’s
    instruments as well as other manufacturers’ instruments.

The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, life
    science, biochemical, industrial, academic and government
    customers working in research and development, quality assurance
    and other laboratory applications. The Company’s Waters
    instruments (LC and MS) are utilized in this broad range of
    industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the
    chemical, physical and biological composition of materials as
    well as to purify a full range of compounds. These instruments
    are used in drug discovery and development, including clinical
    trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes
    (known as “proteomics”), food safety analysis and
    environmental testing. The Company’s thermal analysis,
    rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the
    suitability of fine chemicals and polymers for uses in various
    industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products.

The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in its
    fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital
    goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets
    by calendar year end.

Waters is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding
    common stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating
    subsidiary. Waters became a publicly traded company with its
    initial public offering (“IPO”) in November 1995.
    Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and
    complementary technologies to its range of products with the
    acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited
    (“Micromass”) in September 1997.

Business
    Segments

The Company’s business activities, for which discrete
    financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and
    evaluated by the chief operating decision makers. As a result of
    this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two
    operating segments: Waters Division and TA Division. As
    indicated above, the Company operates in the analytical
    instruments industry, designing, manufacturing, distributing and
    servicing products in three technologies: LC and MS instruments;
    columns and other consumables; and thermal analysis, rheometry
    and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating
    segments, Waters Division and TA Division, have similar economic
    characteristics; product processes; products and services; types
    and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory
    environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments
    have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial
    statement purposes.

Information concerning revenues and long-lived assets
    attributable to each of the Company’s products, services
    and geographic areas are set forth in Note 17 in the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated
    herein by reference.

WATERS
    DIVISION

High
    Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid
    Chromatography

Developed in the 1950’s, HPLC is the standard technique
    used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a
    variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes
    that HPLC’s performance capabilities enable it to separate
    and identify approximately 80% of all known chemicals and
    materials. As a result, HPLC is used to



analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research
    and development purposes, quality control and process
    engineering applications.

The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served
    by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these
    markets, HPLC is used extensively to identify new drugs, develop
    manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new
    pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other
    applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for
    nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations, the
    testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing
    industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as
    chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by
    universities, research institutions and government agencies,
    such as the United States Food and Drug Administration
    (“FDA”) and the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency (“EPA”) and their international counterparts
    that mandate testing that requires HPLC instrumentation.

Traditionally, a typical HPLC system has consisted of five basic
    components: solvent delivery system, sample injector, separation
    column, detector and data acquisition unit. The solvent delivery
    system pumps the solvent through the HPLC system, while the
    sample injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow. The
    chromatography column then separates the sample into its
    components for analysis by the detector, which measures the
    presence and amount of the constituents. The data acquisition
    unit, usually referred to as the instrument’s software or
    data system, then records and stores the information from the
    detector.

In March 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the
    Company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography
    that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter
    particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY
    UPLC

®

,
    to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic
    bands that are generated by these small particles. By using the
    ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more
    comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in
    comparison with many analyses performed by HPLC. In addition, in
    using ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the
    range of application beyond that of HPLC, enabling the
    uncovering of new levels of scientific information. Though it
    offers significant performance advantages, ACQUITY UPLC is
    compatible with the Company’s software products and the
    general operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the
    Company’s customers and field sales and support
    organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology
    and instrument. The Company began shipping the ACQUITY UPLC in
    the third quarter of 2004. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company experienced growth in the instrument systems product
    line primarily from the sales of the ACQUITY UPLC.

Waters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in
    configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation,
    from component configured systems for academic research
    applications to fully automated
    Alliance

®

2795 systems for high speed screening, and that have a variety
    of detection technologies, from ultra-violet (“UV”)
    absorbance to MS, optimized for certain analyses. The Company
    also manufactures tailored LC systems for the analysis of
    biologics as well as an LC detector utilizing evaporative light
    scattering technology to expand the usage of LC to compounds
    that are not amenable to UV absorbance detection.

The primary consumable products for LC are chromatography
    columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in
    the LC testing process and are replaced at regular intervals.
    The chromatography column contains one of several types of
    packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from
    silica. As the sample flows through the column, it is separated
    into its constituent components.

Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and
    competitors’ LC systems. The Company believes that it is
    one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica,
    packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the
    Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key
    attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and
    react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company believes
    that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used nearly
    exclusively on its ACQUITY UPLC instrument and, furthermore,
    that its ACQUITY UPLC instrument will primarily use ACQUITY UPLC
    columns. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, excluding the small impact from
    acquisitions mentioned below, the Company experienced growth in
    its LC chromatography column and sample preparation businesses,
    especially in the
    XBridge

tm

,
    SunFire

tm

and ACQUITY UPLC columns, as well as in
    Oasis

®

sample preparation cartridges.

In February 2006, the Company acquired the net assets of the
    food safety business of VICAM Limited Partnership
    (“VICAM”) for $13.8 million in cash. VICAM is a
    leading provider of tests to identify and quantify



mycotoxins in various agricultural commodities. The
    Company’s test kits provide reliable, quantitative
    detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of
    flurometer, LC-MS or HPLC. In December 2006, the Company
    acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Environmental
    Resources Associates, Inc. (“ERA”), a provider of
    environmental testing products for quality control, proficiency
    testing and specialty calibration chemicals used in
    environmental laboratories, for $61.8 million in cash and
    the assumption of $3.8 million of debt. ERA also provides
    product support services required to help laboratories with
    their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or
    with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis.

Based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and
    publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company
    believes that it is one of the world’s largest
    manufacturers and distributors of LC instruments, chromatography
    columns and other consumables and related services. The Company
    also believes that it has the leading LC market share in the
    United States, Europe and Asia and believes it has a leading
    market share position in Japan.

Mass
    Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is
    used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials
    and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of
    molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that
    have been converted into ions.

The Company believes it is a market leader in the development,
    manufacture, sale and distribution of MS instruments. These
    instruments can be integrated and used along with other
    complementary analytical instruments and systems, such as LC,
    chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis
    chromatography and gas chromatography. A wide variety of
    instrumental designs fall within the overall category of MS
    instrumentation, including devices that incorporate quadrupole,
    ion trap, time of flight (“Tof”) and classical
    magnetic sector technologies. Furthermore, these technologies
    are often used in tandem to maximize the efficacy of certain
    experiments.

Currently, the Company offers a wide range of MS instruments
    utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof, ion mobility
    and magnetic sector designs. These instruments are used in drug
    discovery and development, as well as for environmental testing.
    The majority of mass spectrometers sold by the Company are
    designed to utilize an LC system as the sample introduction
    device. These products supply a diverse market with a strong
    emphasis on the life science, pharmaceutical, biomedical,
    clinical and environmental market segments worldwide.

The mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection
    device for LC. The Company’s smaller-sized mass
    spectrometers (such as the SQD and the TQD) are often referred
    to as LC “detectors” and are either sold as part of an
    LC system or as an LC upgrade. Large quadrupole systems, such as
    the Waters Quattro
    micro

tm

and Quattro
    Premier

tm

XE instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for
    late-stage drug development, including clinical trial testing,
    and Q-Tof instruments, such as the Company’s Q-Tof
    micro

tm

and Q-Tof
    Premier

tm

instruments, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in
    disease processes, an application sometimes referred to as
    “proteomics”. In late 2006, the Company also
    introduced a new tandem quadrupole device, the TQD, and a new
    hybrid quadrupole-time of flight technology system, the
    Synapt

tm

HDMS

tm

.
    The Synapt HDMS system integrates ion mobility technology within
    a
    Q-Tof

tm

geometry instrument configuration and uniquely allows
    researchers to glean molecular shape information, a novel
    capability for a mass spectrometry instrument. The introduction
    of these new products has augmented the recent growth of the MS
    instrument systems.

LC-MS

LC and MS are instrumental technologies often embodied within an
    analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of
    analyses or as a general purpose analytical device. An
    increasing percentage of the Company’s customers are
    purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it is
    becoming common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within
    the same laboratory and be operated by the same user. The
    descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical
    segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical
    categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly
    in today’s instrument market, this segmentation and
    categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of
    instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS
    technologies as part of a single device. In response to this
    development and to further promote the high utilization of these
    hybrid



instruments, the Company has organized its Waters Division to
    develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated LC-MS systems.

Service

The servicing and support of LC and MS instruments and
    accessories is an important source of revenue for the Waters
    Division. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale
    of support plans, demand service, customer training and
    performance validation services. Support plans most typically
    involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to
    promptly repair a non-functioning instrument in return for a fee
    described in a multi-year contract that is priced according to
    the configuration of the instrument.

TA
    DIVISION

Thermal
    Analysis, Rheometry and Calorimetry

Thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of
    materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature
    affect several characteristics of materials, such as their
    physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical
    properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal
    analysis techniques, including calorimetry. Consequently,
    thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development,
    production and characterization of materials in various
    industries, such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles,
    pharmaceuticals and electronics.

Rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in
    characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow
    properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity
    and deformation under different types of “loading” or
    conditions. The information obtained under such conditions
    provides insight to a material’s behavior during
    manufacturing, transport, usage and storage.

Thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are heavily used in
    material testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide
    information useful in predicting the suitability of polymers and
    viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
    healthcare products. As with systems offered through the Waters
    Division, a range of instrumental configurations are available
    with increasing levels of sample handling and information
    processing automation. In addition, systems and accompanying
    software packages can be tailored for specific applications. For
    example, the
    Q-Series

tm

family of differential scanning calorimeters includes a range of
    instruments, from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive
    systems, that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a
    variety of sample cells and temperature control features for
    analyzing a broad range of materials. In 2006, TA introduced
    four new differential scanning calorimeters. During 2005, TA
    introduced a new thermogravimetric analyzer (“TGA”),
    the Q5000IR TGA, and a new AR-G2 rheometer. The introduction of
    these new products significantly helped grow the TA business in
    2007, 2006 and 2005.

In August 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Thermometric AB (“Thermometric”), a
    manufacturer of high performance micro-calorimeters, for
    $2.5 million in cash and the assumption of
    $1.2 million of debt. Thermometric’s flagship product,
    the TAM III, is a modular calorimeter that employs proprietary
    technology to deliver unparalleled calorimetric sensitivity and
    temperature stability. It is routinely used to characterize
    materials and their interactions in the fields of
    pharmaceuticals, life and materials sciences. The TAM III
    systems complement TA’s industry leading Q-Series
    differential scanning calorimeter product line and enhances
    TA’s position as the world’s leading supplier of
    thermal analysis instrumentation.

In August 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Calorimetry Sciences Corporation
    (“CSC”), a privately held company that designs,
    develops and manufactures highly sensitive calorimeters, for
    $7.1 million in cash, including the assumption of
    $1.1 million of liabilities. CSC products and services are
    primarily used in the life-sciences industry. This acquisition
    adds two systems which complement TA’s existing TAM
    micro-calorimeter product line. The Nano-ITC is an isothermal
    titration calorimeter designed to measure protein-ligand binding
    and the interaction of biological materials. The Nano-DSC is an
    ultra-sensitive scanning calorimeter used to measure the
    stability of proteins and other macromolecules in dilute
    solutions and is commonly used in pharmaceutical development
    processes.



Service

The Company sells, supports and services these product offerings
    through TA, headquartered in New Castle, Delaware. TA operates
    independently from the Waters Division, though several of its
    overseas offices are situated in Waters facilities. TA has
    dedicated field sales and service operations. Service sales are
    primarily derived from the sale of replacement parts and from
    billed labor fees associated with the repair, maintenance and
    upgrade of installed systems.

Customers

The Company has a broad and diversified customer base that
    includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts,
    universities and government agencies. The pharmaceutical segment
    represents the Company’s largest sector and includes
    multi-national pharmaceutical companies, generic drug
    manufacturers and biotechnology companies. The Company’s
    other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers,
    polymer manufacturers, food and beverage companies and
    environmental testing laboratories. The Company also sells to
    various universities and government agencies worldwide. The
    Company’s technical support staff works closely with its
    customers in developing and implementing applications that meet
    their full range of analytical requirements.

The Company does not rely on any single customer or one group of
    customers for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal
    years 2007, 2006 and 2005, no single customer accounted for more
    than 3% of the Company’s net sales.

Sales and
    Service

The Company has one of the largest sales and service
    organizations in the industry, focused exclusively on its LC, MS
    and thermal analysis installed base. Across these product
    technologies, using respective specialized sales and service
    forces, the Company serves its customer base with approximately
    2,500 field representatives in 86 sales offices throughout the
    world as of December 31, 2007, compared to approximately
    2,400 field representatives in 82 sales offices as of
    December 31, 2006. The Company’s sales representatives
    have direct responsibility for account relationships, while
    service representatives work in the field to install instruments
    and minimize instrument downtime for customers. Technical
    support representatives work directly with customers, helping
    them to develop applications and procedures. The Company
    provides customers with comprehensive product literature and
    also makes consumable products available through a dedicated
    catalog.

Manufacturing

The Company provides high quality LC products by controlling
    each stage of production of its instruments, columns and
    chemical reagents. The Company currently assembles a substantial
    portion of its LC instruments at its facility in Milford,
    Massachusetts, where it performs machining, assembly and
    testing. The Milford facility maintains a quality management
    system in accordance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2000, ISO
    13485:2003 and applicable regulatory requirements (including FDA
    Quality System Regulations and the European In-Vitro Diagnostics
    Directives). The Company outsources manufacturing of certain
    electronic components, such as computers, monitors and circuit
    boards, to outside vendors that can meet the Company’s
    quality requirements. In 2006, the Company transitioned the
    manufacturing of the Alliance HPLC instrument system to a
    company in Singapore. The Company expects to continue pursuing
    outsourcing opportunities.

The Company manufactures its LC columns at its facilities in
    Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland, where it processes,
    sizes and treats silica and polymeric media that are packed into
    columns, solid phase extraction cartridges and bulk shipping
    containers. The Wexford facility also manufactures and
    distributes certain data, instruments and software components
    for the Company’s LC, MS and thermal analysis product
    lines. These facilities meet the same ISO and FDA standards met
    by the Milford, Massachusetts facility and are registered with
    the FDA.

The Company manufactures most of its MS products at its
    facilities in Manchester, England; Cheshire, England and
    Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the
    Company’s MS instruments are manufactured by long-standing
    outside contractors. Each stage of this supply chain is closely
    monitored by the Company to



maintain its high quality and performance standards. The
    instruments, components or modules are then returned to the
    Company’s facilities where its engineers perform final
    assembly, calibrations to customer specifications and quality
    control procedures. The Company’s MS facilities meet
    similar ISO and FDA standards met by the Milford, Massachusetts
    facility and are registered with the FDA.

Thermal analysis and rheology products are manufactured by TA.
    Thermal analysis products are manufactured at the Company’s
    New Castle, Delaware facility. Rheometry products are
    manufactured at the Company’s New Castle, Delaware and
    Crawley, England facilities. Similar to MS, certain elements of
    TA’s products are manufactured by outside contractors and
    are then returned to the Company’s facilities for final
    assembly, calibration and quality control. The Company’s
    thermal analysis facilities are certified to ISO 9001:2000
    standards.

During 2007 and 2006, the Company added five manufacturing
    locations in connection with the VICAM, ERA, Thermometric and
    CSC acquisitions. VICAM manufactures antibody resin and magnetic
    beads that are packed into columns and kits in Watertown,
    Massachusetts and Nixa, Missouri. ERA manufactures environmental
    proficiency kits in Arvada, Colorado. Thermometric and CSC
    manufacture high performance micro-calorimeters in Sweden and
    Lindon, Utah, respectively.

Research
    and Development

The Company maintains an active research and development program
    focused on the development and commercialization of products
    that both complement and update the existing product offering.
    The Company’s research and development expenditures for
    2007, 2006 and 2005 were $80.6 million, $77.3 million
    and $66.9 million, respectively. Included in the 2007 and
    2006 expenses are $4.3 million and $5.1 million,
    respectively, of costs associated with the adoption of Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123(R),
    “Share-based Payment”. Nearly all of the current LC
    products of the Company have been developed at the
    Company’s main research and development center located in
    Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the
    Company’s extensive field organizations. The majority of
    the MS products have been developed at facilities in England and
    nearly all of the current thermal analysis products have been
    developed at the Company’s research and development center
    in New Castle, Delaware. At December 31, 2007, there were
    628 employees involved in the Company’s research and
    development efforts, compared to 571 employees in 2006. The
    Company has increased research and development expenses relating
    to acquisitions and the Company’s continued commitment to
    invest significantly in new product development and existing
    product enhancements. Despite the Company’s active research
    and development programs, there can be no assurances that the
    Company’s product development and commercialization efforts
    will be successful or that the products developed by the Company
    will be accepted by the marketplace.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 5,000 employees, with
    47% located in the United States, and approximately
    4,700 employees, with 45% located in the United States, at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase of
    6% over 2006 is primarily due to increases in manufacturing
    operations, research and development and from acquisitions. The
    Company considers its employee relations, in general, to be
    good. The Company’s employees are not unionized or
    affiliated with any internal or external labor organizations.
    The Company believes that its future success largely depends
    upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled
    employees.

Competition

The analytical instrument and systems market is highly
    competitive. The Company encounters competition from several
    worldwide instrument manufacturers in both domestic and foreign
    markets for each of its three technologies. The Company competes
    in its markets primarily on the basis of instrument performance,
    reliability, service and, to a lesser extent, price. Some
    competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more
    diversified than the Company’s business but are typically
    less focused on the Company’s chosen markets. Some
    competitors have greater financial and other resources than the
    Company.

In the markets served by the Waters Division, the Company’s
    principal competitors include: Applied BioSystems, Inc., Agilent
    Technologies, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Varian, Inc.,
    Shimadzu Corporation and Bruker BioSciences Corporation. In the
    markets served by TA, the Company’s principal competitors
    include:



PerkinElmer Inc., Mettler-Toledo International Inc.,
    NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern
    Instruments Ltd., Anton-Paar and Microcal, LLC. The Company is
    not currently aware of a competitor that it believes offers an
    instrument system comparable to its ACQUITY UPLC.

The market for consumable LC products, including separation
    columns, is highly competitive and more fragmented than the
    analytical instruments market. The Company encounters
    competition in the consumable columns market from chemical
    companies that produce column chemicals and small specialized
    companies that pack and distribute columns. The Company believes
    that it is one of the few suppliers that process silica, packs
    columns and distributes its own product. The Company competes in
    this market on the basis of reproducibility, reputation,
    performance and, to a lesser extent, price. The Company’s
    principal competitors for consumable products include:
    Phenomenex, Supelco Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., Thermo
    Fisher Scientific Inc. and Merck and Co., Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC
    instrument is designed to offer a predictable level of
    performance when used with ACQUITY UPLC columns to effect the
    chemical separation. UPLC columns are both fluidically and
    electronically connected to the ACQUITY UPLC instrument to allow
    users to simultaneously employ and track the performance status
    of the UPLC column. The Company believes that the expansion of
    ACQUITY UPLC technology will enhance its chromatographic column
    business because of the high level of synergy between ACQUITY
    UPLC columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instrument.

Patents,
    Trademarks and Licenses

The Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents
    and has patent applications pending in the United States and
    abroad. Certain technology and software is licensed from third
    parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The
    Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as
    valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes
    that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is,
    in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss
    would materially affect the Company’s business as a whole.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws,
    regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or
    operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as
    discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal
    practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose
    liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages
    resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases
    of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently
    conducts its operations and has operated its business in the
    past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental
    laws. From time to time, operations of the Company have resulted
    or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or
    liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The
    Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse
    effect on its operations, financial condition or competitive
    position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental
    laws.

results, as well as additional risk factors set forth below.
    Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans,
    intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking
    statements, whether because of these factors or for other
    reasons. The Company does not assume any obligation to update
    any forward-looking statements.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

Competition
    and the Analytical Instrument Market

The analytical instrument market and, in particular, the portion
    related to the Company’s HPLC, UPLC, MS, LC-MS, thermal
    analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines, is highly
    competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. The
    Company encounters competition from several international
    instrument manufacturers and other companies in both domestic
    and foreign markets. Some competitors have instrument businesses
    that are generally more diversified than the Company’s
    business but are typically less focused on the Company’s
    chosen markets. There can be no assurances that the
    Company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and
    less costly products than those of the Company or that the
    Company will be able to increase its sales and profitability
    from new product introductions. There can be no assurances that
    the Company’s sales and marketing forces will compete
    successfully against its competitors in the future.

Additionally, the analytical instrument market may, from time to
    time, experience low sales growth. Approximately 52% of the
    Company’s net sales in both 2007 and 2006 were to the
    worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, which may
    be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and
    consolidations. Unfavorable industry conditions could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations or financial condition.

Risk of
    Disruption

The Company manufactures LC instruments at facilities in
    Milford, Massachusetts and Singapore; chemistry separation
    columns at its facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford,
    Ireland; MS products at its facilities in Manchester, England,
    Cheshire, England and Wexford, Ireland; thermal analysis
    products at its facility in New Castle, Delaware; rheometry
    products at its facilities in New Castle, Delaware and Crawley,
    England and other instruments and consumables at various other
    locations as a result of the 2007 and 2006 acquisitions. Any
    prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these
    facilities, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or
    damage to any facility or other reasons, could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or
    financial condition.



Foreign
    Operations and Exchange Rates

Approximately 68% of the Company’s net sales in both 2007
    and 2006 were outside of the United States and were primarily
    denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company has
    considerable manufacturing operations in Ireland and the United
    Kingdom. As a result, a significant portion of the
    Company’s sales and operations are subject to certain
    risks, including adverse developments in the foreign political
    and economic environment; tariffs and other trade barriers;
    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and
    potentially adverse tax consequences.

Additionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s
    net sales and cost of sales varies with currency exchange rate
    fluctuations. Significant increases or decreases in the value of
    the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies
    could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial condition.

Reliance
    on Key Management

The operation of the Company requires managerial and operational
    expertise. None of the key management employees have an
    employment contract with the Company and there can be no
    assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company.
    If, for any reason, such key personnel do not continue to be
    active in management, the Company’s results of operations
    or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Protection
    of Intellectual Property

The Company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights
    and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as
    material and patentable. However, there can be no assurances
    that any patents held by the Company will not be challenged,
    invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted
    thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company.
    Conversely, there could be successful claims against the Company
    by third-party patent holders with respect to certain Company
    products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of
    such third parties. The Company’s patents, including those
    licensed from others, expire on various dates. If the Company is
    unable to protect its intellectual property rights, it could
    have an adverse and material effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial condition.

Reliance
    on Customer Demand

The demand for the Company’s products is dependent upon the
    size of the markets for its LC, MS, thermal analysis and
    rheometry products, the timing and level of capital expenditures
    of the Company’s customers, changes in government
    regulations, funding available to academic and government
    institutions, general economic conditions and the rate of
    economic growth in the Company’s major markets and
    competitive considerations. There can be no assurances that the
    Company’s results of operations or financial condition will
    not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors
    listed above.

Reliance
    on Suppliers

Most of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by
    the Company are available from a number of different suppliers;
    however, a number of items are purchased from limited or single
    sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have a
    temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results
    of the Company. The Company believes alternative sources could
    ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials, but a
    prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components
    could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition or results of operations and could result in damage to
    its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely
    affect the Company’s business.

Reliance
    on Outside Manufacturers

Certain components or modules of the Company’s LC and MS
    instruments are manufactured by long-standing outside
    contractors. In April 2006, the Company transitioned the
    manufacturing of the Alliance HPLC instrument system to a
    company in Singapore. Disruptions of service by these outside
    contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and
    the financial results of the Company. The Company believes that
    it could obtain alternative sources for these components or
    modules, but a prolonged inability to obtain these components or
    modules could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition or results of operations.



Risk in
    Unexpected Shifts in Taxable Income between Tax
    Jurisdictions

The Company is subject to a range of income tax rates, from 0%
    to in excess of 35%, depending on specific tax jurisdictions
    around the world. The Company typically generates a substantial
    portion of its taxable income in the fourth quarter of each
    fiscal year. Shifts in actual taxable income from previous
    quarters’ projections due to factors, including, but not
    limited to, changes in volume and foreign currency translation
    rates, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s income
    tax expense and results of operations.

Levels of
    Debt and Debt Service Requirements

The Company had approximately $884.2 million in debt and
    $693.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments as of December 31, 2007. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company also has the ability to
    borrow an additional $233.2 million from its existing
    credit facilities. Most of the Company’s debt is in the
    U.S. While there is a substantial cash requirement in the
    U.S. to fund operations and capital expenditures, service
    debt interest obligations, finance potential acquisitions and
    continue authorized stock repurchase programs, a majority of the
    Company’s cash is maintained and generated from foreign
    operations. The Company’s financial condition and results
    of operations could be adversely impacted if the Company is
    unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the
    U.S. to address these requirements through cash from
    U.S. operations, efficient and timely repatriation of cash
    from overseas and other sources obtained at an acceptable cost.

Item 3:

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company filed suit in the United States against
    Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH (collectively,
    “HP”), seeking a declaration that certain products
    sold under the mark “Alliance” did not constitute an
    infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or its foreign
    subsidiaries (the “HP patents”). The action in the
    United States was dismissed for lack of controversy. Actions
    seeking revocation or nullification of foreign HP patents were
    filed by the Company in Germany, France and England. A German
    patent tribunal found the HP German patent to be valid. In
    Germany, France and England, HP and its successor, Agilent
    Technologies Deutschland GmbH (“Agilent”), brought
    actions alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump may
    infringe the HP patents. In England, the Court of Appeal found
    the HP patent valid and infringed. The Company’s petitions
    for leave to appeal to the House of Lords were denied. A trial
    on damages was scheduled for November 2004.

In March 2004, Agilent brought a new action against the Company
    alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump continued to
    infringe the HP patents. At a hearing held in the UK in June
    2004, the UK court postponed the previously scheduled November
    2004 damages trial until March 2005. Instead, the court
    scheduled the trial in the new action for November 2004. In
    December 2004, following a trial in the new action, the UK court
    ruled that the Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent
    filed an appeal in that action, which was heard in July 2005,
    and the UK Appellate Court upheld the lower court’s ruling
    of non-infringement. The damages trial scheduled for March 2005
    was postponed pending this appeal and rescheduled for December
    2005. In December 2005, a trial on damages commenced in the
    first action and continued for six days prior to a holiday
    recess. In February 2006, the Company, HP and Agilent entered
    into a settlement agreement (the “Agilent Settlement
    Agreement”) with respect to the first action and a consent
    order dismissing the case was entered. The Agilent Settlement
    Agreement provides for the release of the Company and its UK
    affiliate from each and every claim under Agilent’s
    European patent (UK) number 309,596 arising out of the prior
    sale by either of them of Alliance Separations Modules
    incorporating the patented technology. In consideration of
    entering into the Agilent Settlement Agreement and the consent
    order, the Company made a payment to Agilent of 3.5 million
    British Pounds, in full and final settlement of Agilent’s
    claim for damages and in relation to all claims for costs and
    interest in the case.

In France, the Paris District Court has found the HP patent
    valid and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company appealed
    the French decision and, in April 2004, the French appeals court
    affirmed the Paris District Court’s finding of
    infringement. The Company has filed a further appeal in the case
    and the appeal was dismissed in March 2007. The Company has
    sought a declaration from the French court that, as was found in
    both the UK and



Germany, certain modified features of the Alliance pump do not
    infringe the HP patents. A hearing on this matter was held in
    September 2007 and, in December 2007, the French court held that
    the modified features of the Alliance pump are non-infringing.
    Agilent has appealed this ruling.

In the German case, a German court has found the patent
    infringed. The Company appealed the German decision and, in
    December 2004, the German appeals court reversed the trial court
    and issued a finding of non-infringement in favor of the
    Company. Agilent sought an appeal in that action and the appeal
    was heard in April 2007. Following the hearing, the German
    Federal Court of Justice set aside the judgment of the appeals
    court and remanded the case back to the appeals court for
    further proceedings. In July 2005, Agilent brought a new action
    against the Company alleging that certain features of the
    Alliance pump continue to infringe the HP patents. In August
    2006, following a trial in this new action the German court
    ruled that the Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent
    has filed an appeal in this action. A hearing on this appeal was
    held in January 2008. The court has not yet rendered a decision.

The Company recorded provisions in 2002, 2004 and 2005 for
    estimated damages, legal fees and court costs to be incurred
    with respect to this ongoing litigation. The provisions
    represent management’s best estimate of the probable and
    reasonably estimable loss related to the litigations.

Restatement
    of Fiscal 2007 Quarterly Financial Data

As further described in Note 19 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has restated its
    unaudited consolidated balance sheets and unaudited consolidated
    statements of cash flows for each of the first three quarters in
    fiscal 2007, to change the classification of certain marketable
    securities from cash and cash equivalents to short-term
    investments.

Business
    and Financial Overview

The Company’s sales were $1,473.0 million,
    $1,280.2 million and $1,158.2 million in 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. Sales grew 15% in 2007 over 2006 and 11%
    in 2006 over 2005. Overall, the sales growth achieved in these
    years can be primarily attributed to the Company’s
    introduction of new products; an increase in spending by



the Company’s pharmaceutical, industrial, governmental and
    academic customers; the benefits from acquisitions and the
    effects of foreign currency translation.

Net income per diluted share was $2.62, $2.13 and $1.74 in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Net income per diluted share grew
    at a rate of 23% in 2007 over 2006 and 22% in 2006 over 2005.

The effect of currency translation benefited the 2007 sales
    growth rate by 3% and benefited the 2006 sales growth rate by
    less than 1%, both increases principally resulting from European
    sales. U.S. sales increased 17% and 4%; European sales
    increased 17% and 12%; and Asian sales (including Japan)
    increased 12% and 19% during 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In 2007 and 2006, global sales to pharmaceutical customers grew
    13% and 8%, respectively, as these customers increased their
    capital spending on the Company’s new products. Global
    sales to government and academic customers were 24% higher in
    2007 and 16% higher in 2006 and can be primarily attributed to
    strong demand of the Company’s new products in the U.S.,
    Europe and Asia. Global sales to industrial and food safety
    customers grew 16% in 2007 and 13% in 2006 primarily as a result
    of the benefit from acquisitions and strong demand for the
    Company’s new products.

The Waters Division sales grew by 14% in 2007 and 11% in 2006.
    The Waters Division’s products and services consist of high
    performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra
    performance liquid
    chromatography

®

(“UPLC” and together with HPLC, herein referred to as
    “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and
    chemistry consumable products and related services. The Waters
    Division sales growth was strongly influenced by ACQUITY
    UPLC

®

sales; the new high resolution Q-Tof
    Premier

tm

and new
    Synapt

tm

HDMS

tm

systems; organic sales growth from the chemistry consumables
    business and the 2006 acquisitions. These acquisitions added 1%
    to the 2007 sales growth.

Sales growth for the TA Division (“TA”), a business
    with a heavy industrial focus, grew 27% and 9% for 2007 and
    2006, respectively. TA’s sales growth can be primarily
    attributed to new product introductions and the impact of the
    August 2007 acquisition of Calorimetry Sciences Corporation
    (“CSC”), a privately held company that designs,
    develops and manufactures highly sensitive calorimeters and the
    August 2006 Thermometric AB (“Thermometric”)
    acquisition. The CSC and Thermometric sales benefited TA’s
    sales growth rate by 4% in 2007. CSC’s earnings after debt
    service were about neutral for the year ended December 31,
    2007. CSC product sales in 2008 are expected to be approximately
    $5.0 million. TA sales growth for 2007 also benefited from
    a larger than normal backlog of orders in 2006 which were
    shipped in the first quarter of 2007.

In September 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved various amendments to freeze the pay credit accrual
    under the Waters Retirement Plan and the Waters Retirement
    Restoration Plan (the “U.S. Pension Plans”)
    effective December 31, 2007 and, effective January 1,
    2008, the employer matching contribution in the Waters Employee
    Investment Plan (a 401(k) defined contribution plan) was
    increased by 3%. The Company’s Board of Directors also
    approved a transitional contribution into the Waters Employee
    Investment Plan to assist employees in transitioning to the new
    pension benefit design. The Company recorded a
    $12.6 million charge in 2007 relating to this transition
    benefit that will be contributed to the Waters Employee
    Investment Plan in the first quarter of 2008.

Operating income was $348.9 million, $295.2 million
    and $283.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    The $53.7 million net increase in 2007 operating income
    over 2006 is primarily a result of the benefits from the
    increased sales volume and the impact of the $8.5 million
    of restructuring costs incurred in 2006 relating to the February
    2006 cost reduction initiative. This increase was offset by the
    $12.6 million charge taken in 2007 related to the
    transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment
    Plan. The $12.0 million net increase in 2006 operating
    income over 2005 is primarily a result of the benefit from the
    increased sales volume being partially offset by
    $28.0 million of the additional stock-based compensation
    costs incurred as a result of the adoption of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”, and
    $8.5 million of restructuring costs incurred relating to
    the February 2006 cost reduction initiative.

Operating cash flow was $370.5 million, $263.6 million
    and $298.1 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    The $106.9 million increase in the 2007 operating cash flow
    as compared to 2006 is primarily the result of higher net
    income; the leveling off of the inventory

ramp-up

in
    2006 for new product introductions and safety stock related to
    outsourcing; and the timing of payments to vendors. Included in
    the 2006 operating cash flow was a



$9.0 million tax payment associated with the American Jobs
    Creation Act (“AJCA”), a $3.5 million litigation
    payment and $7.0 million of severance and other
    facility-related payments made in connection with the cost
    reduction initiative. The decline in the 2006 operating cash
    flow as compared to 2005 can be attributed to an increase in
    inventories of $29.9 million over 2005. The 2006 inventory
    increase is attributable to the

ramp-up

of
    new product introductions and an increase in the safety stock
    levels resulting from the outsourcing of the
    Alliance

®

instrument system manufacturing. Operating cash flows continue
    to benefit from the improvement in accounts receivable
    collection measured in days-sales-outstanding (“DSO”).
    DSO’s were 66 days, 64 days and 70 days at
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital
    expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software
    capitalization were $60.3 million, $51.4 million and
    $51.0 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    Company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses,
    product lines and technologies to augment the Waters and TA
    operating divisions. In June 2007, the Company made an equity
    investment in Thar Instruments, Inc., a privately held global
    leader in the design, development and manufacture of analytical
    and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and
    supercritical fluid extraction systems, for $3.5 million in
    cash. In August 2007, the Company paid $7.1 million in
    cash, including the assumption of $1.1 million of
    liabilities, for CSC.

In February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million
    of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During
    2007, the Company repurchased a total of 3.4 million shares
    at a cost of $200.5 million under the February 2007 and
    October 2005 stock repurchase programs. The Company believes
    that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share
    repurchases given current cash and debt levels and invest in
    research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow
    the Company’s sales and profits.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2006

Net
    Sales

Net sales for 2007 and 2006 were $1,473.0 million and
    $1,280.2 million, respectively, an increase of 15%. Foreign
    currency translation benefited sales growth for 2007 by 3%.
    Product sales were $1,072.9 million and $922.5 million
    for 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of 16%. The
    increase in product sales was primarily due to the overall
    positive growth in Waters and TA instrument systems, chemistry
    consumables and the effect of acquisitions. The impact of the
    2006 acquisitions accounted for 2% of the product sales growth
    in 2007. Service sales were $400.2 million and
    $357.7 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase
    of 12%. The increase in service sales was primarily attributable
    to growth in the Company’s installed base of instruments
    and higher sales of service contracts.

Waters
    Division Net Sales

The Waters Division net sales grew 14% in 2007. The effect of
    foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division sales
    growth by 3%. Chemistry consumables sales grew 24% in 2007. This
    growth was driven by increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC
    proprietary column technology products, new
    XBridge

tm

columns,
    Oasis

®

sample preparation products and the sales associated with the
    2006 acquisitions (Environmental Resources Associates
    (“ERA”) and VICAM Limited Partnership
    (“VICAM”) product lines). These acquisitions benefited
    the chemistry consumable sales growth rate by 9%. Waters
    Division service sales grew 11% in 2007 due to increased sales
    of service plans to the higher installed base of customers.
    Waters instrument systems sales (LC and MS) grew 13% in 2007.
    The increase in instrument systems sales during 2007 is
    primarily attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC systems
    and Synapt HDMS system sales. Waters Division sales by product
    mix were essentially unchanged in 2007 and 2006 with instrument
    systems, chemistry and service representing approximately 56%,
    17% and 27%, respectively. Geographically, Waters Division sales
    in the U.S., Europe and Asia strengthened approximately 15%, 16%
    and 10% in 2007, respectively. Sales to the rest of the world
    increased 10% in 2007. The effects of foreign currency
    translation increased sales growth by 9% in Europe and increased
    sales growth in Asia by 1% in 2007. U.S., Europe and Asia sales
    growth in 2007 was primarily due to higher demand from the
    Company’s pharmaceutical and industrial customers. The
    growth in Europe was broad-based across most major countries,
    particularly in Eastern Europe. Asia’s growth was primarily
    driven by increased sales in India and China which was offset by
    a 1% sales decrease in Japan. Japan’s 2007 instrument
    systems and consumable sales were impacted by strong 2006 sales
    attributed to drinking water and food safety regulation changes.



TA
    Division Net Sales

TA’s sales grew 27% in 2007 primarily as a result of
    TA’s new product introductions, strong sales growth in the
    U.S. and Europe and expansion of its Asian businesses, as
    well as a larger than normal backlog of orders in 2006 which
    were shipped in the first quarter of 2007. The sales growth rate
    in 2007 also benefited from the CSC and Thermometric
    acquisitions which added 4% to the TA sales growth rate. The
    effect of foreign currency translation benefited the TA sales
    growth by 3% in 2007. Instrument system sales grew 29% and
    represented approximately 70% and 69% of sales in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. TA service sales grew 23% in 2007 and can be
    primarily attributed to the higher installed base of customers.
    Geographically, sales growth for 2007 was predominantly in the
    U.S., Europe and Asia.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit for 2007 was $841.9 million compared to
    $744.0 million for 2006, an increase of $97.9 million,
    or 13%, and is generally consistent with the increase in net
    sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 57.2%
    in 2007 from 58.1% in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to
    increased sales of new products which have higher manufacturing
    costs and the unfavorable foreign currency impact related to the
    cost of products manufactured in Ireland and the United Kingdom.
    In addition, gross profit was negatively impacted by
    $2.6 million related to the transitional contribution into
    the Waters Employee Investment Plan.

Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses for 2007 and 2006 were
    $403.7 million and $357.7 million, respectively, an
    increase of 13%. Included in selling and administrative expenses
    for 2007 is a $7.4 million charge related to the
    transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment
    Plan. The remaining $38.6 million increase in total selling
    and administrative expenses for 2007 is primarily due to annual
    merit increases across most divisions; headcount additions to
    support the increased sales volume; costs from new acquisitions
    and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. As a
    percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses
    were 27.4% for 2007 compared to 27.9% for 2006.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $80.6 million and
    $77.3 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase
    of $3.3 million, or 4%. The increase in research and
    development expenses is primarily due to the $2.2 million
    charge related to the transitional contribution into the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan.

    Restructuring

In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan,
    primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe, that
    resulted in the employment of 74 employees being
    terminated, all of which had left the Company as of
    December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company closed a sales
    and demonstration office in the Netherlands in the second
    quarter of 2006. The Company implemented this cost reduction
    plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business
    opportunities around the world. The Company does not expect to
    incur any additional charges in connection with the February
    2006 cost reduction initiative.

The following is a summary of activity of the Company’s
    restructuring liability included in other current liabilities on

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
    $5.8 million charge for an other-than-temporary impairment
    to an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
    (“Caprion”). The charge was recorded in 2006 when the
    Company learned that Caprion’s financial condition had
    deteriorated and a merger was in process that, in the



Company’s assessment, would result in the Company’s
    investment being substantially diminished. In March 2007,
    Caprion merged with Ecopia BioSciences Inc. and is now named
    Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Thallion”). Thallion
    is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the
    Company’s investment is accounted for under
    SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
    in Debt and Equity Securities”. The market value of the
    Thallion investment was approximately $0.3 million and
    $1.7 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $56.5 million and $51.7 million
    for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest
    expense is primarily attributable to an increase in average
    borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase
    programs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in interest rates
    on the Company’s outstanding debt during 2007.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $30.8 million and $25.3 million
    for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest income
    is primarily due to higher invested cash balances.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

In January 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”). This interpretation prescribes the
    methodology by which a company must measure, report, present and
    disclose in its financial statements the effects of any
    uncertain tax return reporting positions that a company has
    taken or expects to take. See Note 9, “Income
    Taxes”, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information.

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were
    17.1% and 15.5%, respectively. This net increase is primarily
    attributable to increased net income in jurisdictions with
    comparatively higher tax rates. Included in the 2007 tax
    provision is a tax benefit of $4.4 million associated with
    the charge related to the transitional contribution into the
    Waters Employee Investment Plan.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2005

Net
    Sales

Net sales for 2006 and 2005 were $1,280.2 million and
    $1,158.2 million, respectively, an increase of 11%. Foreign
    currency translation benefited the 2006 sales growth rate by
    less than 1%. Product sales were $922.5 million and
    $834.7 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase
    of 11%. The increase in product sales was primarily due to the
    overall positive growth in Waters and TA instrument systems
    sales, chemistry consumables sales and the effect of
    acquisitions. Service sales were $357.7 million and
    $323.6 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase
    of 11%. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the
    Company’s installed base of instruments and higher sales of
    service contracts.

Waters
    Division Net Sales

The Waters Division sales grew 11% in 2006. The effect of
    foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division sales
    growth by less than 1%. Chemistry consumables sales grew
    approximately 18% in 2006. This growth was primarily driven by
    increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC proprietary column
    technology, new XBridge columns, Oasis sample preparation
    products and the sales associated with the acquired VICAM
    product line. Waters Division service sales grew 9% in 2006
    primarily due to increased sales of service plans to the higher
    installed base of customers. Waters instrument systems sales
    grew 9% in 2006. The increase in Waters instrument system sales
    during 2006 is primarily attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY
    UPLC systems and higher MS triple quadrupole system sales,
    offset by a decline in lower-end MS systems sales. Waters
    Division sales by product mix were essentially unchanged in 2006
    and 2005 with instruments, chemistry and service representing
    approximately 57%, 16% and 27%, respectively. Geographically,
    Waters Division sales in Asia, Europe and the
    U.S. strengthened approximately 19%, 12% and 4% in 2006,
    respectively. Sales to the rest of the world increased 5% in
    2006. The effects of foreign currency translation decreased
    sales growth in Asia by 3% and increased sales growth by 2% in
    Europe in 2006. Asia’s growth was primarily driven by
    increased sales in India and China while the growth in



Europe was broad-based across most major countries, particularly
    in Eastern Europe. U.S. sales growth in 2006 was primarily
    due to higher demand from the Company’s pharmaceutical and
    industrial customers.

TA
    Division Net Sales

TA’s sales grew 9% in 2006 primarily as a result of
    TA’s new product introductions and expansion of its Asian
    businesses. Foreign currency translation had no impact to this
    overall sales growth rate. Instrument system sales grew 4% as TA
    introduced four new differential scanning calorimeters during
    2006 and, in late August 2006, the Company entered the field of
    micro-calorimetry through the acquisition of Thermometric.
    Instrument system sales represented approximately 69% and 73% of
    sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. TA service sales grew 22%
    in 2006 and can be attributed to the increased sales of service
    plans to the higher installed base of customers. Geographically,
    sales growth for 2006 was predominantly in Europe and Asia.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit for 2006 was $744.0 million compared to
    $679.9 million for 2005, an increase of $64.1 million,
    or 9%, and is generally consistent with the increase in net
    sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 58.1%
    in 2006 from 58.7% in 2005. The 2006 gross profit was
    negatively impacted by $4.3 million of stock-based
    compensation costs relating to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R). The remaining slight decrease in
    gross profit percentage in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily
    due to product transition costs to Singapore and product
    introduction costs on new MS instruments.

Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses for 2006 and 2005 were
    $357.7 million and $321.7 million, respectively, an
    increase of 11%. The $36.0 million increase in total
    selling and administrative expenses for 2006 is primarily due to
    additional stock-based compensation costs of $18.6 million;
    annual merit increases across most divisions and headcount
    additions to support the increased sales volume. Other increases
    in selling and administration expenses were offset by decreases
    related to the February 2006 cost reduction initiative. The
    Company made investments in Asia, largely in the second half of
    2006, in support of growing business opportunities. As a
    percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses
    were 27.9% for 2006 compared to 27.8% for 2005.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $77.3 million and
    $66.9 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase
    of $10.4 million, or 16%. The increase in research and
    development expenses is primarily due to stock-based
    compensation costs of $5.1 million relating to the adoption
    of SFAS No. 123(R). The remaining increases in
    research and development expenses in 2006 as compared to 2005
    primarily reflects the costs of introducing multiple new MS
    instruments in the second half of 2006.

    Restructuring

In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan,
    primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe, that
    resulted in the employment of 74 employees being
    terminated, all of which had left the Company as of
    December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company closed a sales
    and demonstration office in the Netherlands in the second
    quarter of 2006. The Company implemented this cost reduction
    plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business
    opportunities around the world.

The following is a summary of activity of the Company’s
    restructuring liability included in other current liabilities on
    the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands):

Litigation
    Provisions

Litigation provisions in 2005 were $3.1 million relating to
    patent litigation with Agilent Technologies, Inc.
    (“Agilent”). This patent litigation was settled in
    February 2006 and recorded in the 2005 statement of
    operations. No additional provisions were made in 2006.

Other
    Expense, Net

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
    $5.8 million charge for an other-than-temporary impairment
    to an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
    (“Caprion”). The charge was recorded in 2006 when the
    Company learned that Caprion’s financial condition had
    deteriorated and a merger was in process that, in the
    Company’s assessment, would result in the Company’s
    investment being substantially diminished. In March 2007,
    Caprion merged with Ecopia BioSciences Inc. and is now named
    Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Thallion”). Thallion
    is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the
    Company’s investment is accounted for under
    SFAS No. 115. The market value of the Thallion
    investment was approximately $1.7 million as of
    December 31, 2006.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company sold all of its
    equity investment in Nuvelo, Inc. and recorded a gain of
    $1.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company
    also recorded a $4.8 million pre-tax charge for an
    other-than-temporary impairment for the full value of the
    Company’s investment in Beyond Genomics, Inc. This charge
    was recorded based on the Company’s assessment of Beyond
    Genomics, Inc.’s financial condition.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $51.7 million and $24.7 million
    for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest
    expense is primarily attributable to increases in interest rates
    on the Company’s outstanding debt and an increase in
    average borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase
    programs.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $25.3 million and $19.3 million
    for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest income
    is primarily due to higher interest rate yields.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were
    15.5% and 26.4%, respectively. Included in the 2005 effective
    tax rate is the effect of $24.0 million of income tax
    expense related to the repatriation of funds from the
    Company’s foreign subsidiaries under the AJCA. The
    remaining decrease in the effective tax rates for 2006 compared
    to 2005 is primarily attributable to increased income in
    jurisdictions with comparatively low tax rates. In addition, the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in the
    recognition of a tax benefit at a higher effective tax rate in
    2006.

Cash Flow
    from Operating Activities

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2006

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $370.5 million and $263.6 million in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The $106.9 million increase in net cash
    provided from operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is
    attributed primarily to the following significant changes in the
    sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities,
    aside from the increase in net income:

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2007 compared to 2006 is
    primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by
    customers and the higher sales volume in 2007 as compared to
    2006. DSO increased to 66 days at December 31, 2007
    from 64 days at December 31, 2006.

•

Inventory growth was much lower in 2007 compared to 2006
    primarily due to 2006 having a higher

ramp-up

of
    new products launched later in that year and the increased
    levels of Alliance inventory during the 2006 outsourcing
    transition to Singapore.

•

The 2007 changes in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities and other changes compared to 2006 is primarily
    attributable to the reclassification within these line items of
    certain income tax liabilities from current to long-term
    liabilities required by the adoption of FIN 48. The overall
    net change in these items can be attributed to an increase in
    accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the timing
    of payments to vendors, an increase in income tax liabilities
    and an increase in accrued compensation resulting from the
    $12.6 million transitional contribution into the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan partially offset by the reduction in
    the pension liability relating to the freezing of the
    U.S. Pension Plans. The one-time transitional contribution
    into the Waters Employee Investment Plan will be made in the
    first quarter of 2008.

•

The change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was
    also impacted by a tax payment in 2006 in the amount of
    $9.0 million related to the distribution and repatriation
    of cash under the AJCA. No such payment was made in 2007. Also,
    included in the change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities in 2006 were $7.0 million of severance and
    other facility-related payments in connection with the cost
    reduction initiative and a litigation payment of
    $3.5 million to settle the Agilent litigation.



•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in
    both 2007 and 2006 was a result of the installed base of
    customers renewing annual service contracts.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2005

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $263.6 million and $298.1 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The $34.5 million decline in net cash
    provided from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is
    attributed primarily to the following significant changes in the
    sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities,
    aside from the increase in net income and the impact of stock
    compensation under SFAS No. 123(R):

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2006 compared to 2005 is
    primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by
    customers and the higher sales volume in 2006 as compared to
    2005. DSO decreased to 64 days at December 31, 2006
    from 70 days at December 31, 2005.

•

The change in inventory in 2006 compared to 2005 results from
    the increase in inventory due to the

ramp-up

of
    new MS products, an increase in LC instrument inventory
    associated with the transition to higher production levels of
    ACQUITY systems from Alliance systems and a planned increase in
    the Alliance inventory levels during the outsourcing transition.

•

The 2006 change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities was impacted by cash payments made on increased
    inventory levels, severance and other facility related payments
    of $7.0 million in connection with the cost reduction
    initiative and a litigation payment of $3.5 million to
    settle the Agilent litigation.

•

Also included in the change in accounts payable and other
    current liabilities in 2006 was a tax payment in the amount of
    $9.0 million related to the distribution and repatriation
    of cash under the AJCA. During 2005, the income tax accrual was
    increased by $24.0 million resulting from the repatriation
    of funds under the AJCA.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in
    both 2006 and 2005 was a result of the installed base of
    customers renewing annual service contracts.

•

2006 net cash provided by operating activities as compared
    to 2005 was impacted by the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Under SFAS No. 123(R),
    $16.5 million of benefits of tax deductions in excess of
    recognized compensation costs were reported as cash from
    financing activities in 2006; prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), this benefit of $4.9 million in
    2005 was reported as part of cash from operating activities.

Cash Used
    in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities totaled
    $167.9 million in 2007 compared to $130.4 million in
    2006 and $51.0 million in 2005. Additions to fixed assets
    and software capitalization were $60.3 million in 2007,
    $51.4 million in 2006 and $51.0 million in 2005.
    Capital spending and software capitalization additions were
    consistent with capital spending trends and expectations
    throughout the respective years to accommodate the
    Company’s growth. Business acquisitions, net of cash
    acquired, were $9.1 million and $79.0 million in 2007
    and 2006, respectively. In addition, in 2007, the Company
    received $0.7 million from the former shareholders of ERA
    in connection with the finalization of the purchase price in
    accordance with the purchase and sales agreement. There were no
    business acquisitions in 2005. In June 2007, the Company made an
    equity investment in Thar Instruments, Inc., a privately held
    global leader in the design, development and manufacture of
    analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography
    and supercritical fluid extraction systems, for
    $3.5 million in cash. During 2007, the Company purchased a
    net $95.7 million of short-term investments.

Cash Used
    in Financing Activities

In January 2007, Waters Corporation and Waters Technologies
    Ireland Ltd. entered into a new credit agreement (the “2007
    Credit Agreement”). The 2007 Credit Agreement provides for
    a $500 million term loan facility; a $350 million
    revolving facility (“U.S. Tranche”), which
    includes both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility;
    and a $250 million revolving facility (“European
    Tranche”) that is available to Waters Corporation in
    U.S. dollars and Waters Technologies Ireland Ltd. in either
    U.S. dollars or Euros. Waters Corporation may on one or
    more



occasions request of the lender group that commitments for the
    U.S. Tranche or European Tranche be increased by an amount
    of not less than $25 million, up to an aggregate additional
    amount of $250 million. Existing lenders are not obligated
    to increase commitments and the Company can seek to bring in
    additional lenders. The term loan facility and the revolving
    facilities both mature on January 11, 2012 and require no
    scheduled prepayments before that date.

In January 2007, the Company borrowed $500 million under
    the new term loan facility, $115 million under the new
    European Tranche and $270 million under the new
    U.S. Tranche revolving facility. The Company used the
    proceeds of the term loan and the revolving borrowings to repay
    the outstanding amounts under the Company’s previous
    multi-borrower credit agreements entered into in December 2004
    and November 2005. Waters Corporation terminated such agreements
    early without penalty.

The interest rates applicable to term loan and revolving loans
    under the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s
    option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of
    the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus

1/2%)

or the
    applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each
    case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s
    leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and
    72.5 basis points. The facility fee on the 2007 Credit
    Agreement ranges between 7 basis points and 15 basis
    points. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company
    comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than
    3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any
    period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively, the
    same as the terminated credit agreements. In addition, the 2007
    Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that are customary
    for investment grade credit facilities and are similar in nature
    to ones contained in the terminated credit agreements. The 2007
    Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations
    and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default
    which are similar in nature to those in the terminated credit
    agreements.

During 2007, the Company’s net debt borrowings decreased by
    $19.3 million compared to an increase of $72.2 million
    in 2006 and $369.6 million in 2005. As of December 31,
    2007, the Company had $865.0 million borrowed under the
    credit agreement dated as of January 2007 and an amount
    available to borrow of $233.2 million after outstanding
    letters of credit.

In August 2007, the Company entered into two new
    floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swaps, each with a notional
    amount of $50.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt
    related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt. The
    maturity dates of the swaps are April 2009 and October 2009.

In February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million
    of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During
    2007, the Company repurchased 2.8 million shares at a cost
    of $166.1 million under this program, leaving
    $333.9 million authorized for future repurchases. The
    Company repurchased 3.4 million, 5.8 million and
    15.4 million shares at a cost of $200.5 million,
    $249.2 million and $659.3 million during 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively, under the February 2007 and previously
    announced programs.

The Company received $91.4 million, $39.9 million and
    $16.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock
    options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the employee
    stock purchase plan in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Proceeds from stock option exercises were higher in 2007
    compared to 2006 and 2005 and are believed to be attributable to
    the increase in the Company’s stock price.

The Company believes that the cash and cash equivalent balance
    of $597.3 million and the short-term investments balance of
    $95.7 million as of December 31, 2007 and expected
    cash flow from operating activities, together with borrowing
    capacity from committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to
    fund working capital, capital spending requirements, authorized
    share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse
    final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next
    twelve months. Management believes, as of the date of this
    report, that its financial position, along with expected future
    cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the
    ability to raise funds from external sources, will be sufficient
    to meet future operating and investing needs for the foreseeable
    future.

The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days
    or less, in commercial paper rated A1 or A1+ by
    Standard & Poors and P1 by Moody’s Investors
    Service; bank deposits; repurchase agreements;
    U.S. Government Agency Debt and AAA rated money market
    funds. Similar



investments with longer maturities are classified as short-term
    investments. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are
    convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant
    risk of change in market value. The Company maintains balances
    in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured
    limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other
    than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2007, the
    Company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial
    paper issued by structured investment vehicles, collateralized
    debt obligation conduits or asset-backed conduits.

(1)

The interest rates applicable to any U.S. borrowings under the
    2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal
    to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate
    or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3,
    6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest
    rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which
    can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis
    points. At current and long-term debt levels and interest rates
    consistent with those at December 31, 2007, the
    Company’s interest expense would be approximately
    $44.0 million annually, which is not disclosed in the above
    table.

(2)

Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of
    business.

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third
    parties which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid
    for licenses were approximately $0.3 million in 2007,
    $0.6 million in 2006 and $0.8 million in 2005. Future
    minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements
    as of December 31, 2007 are immaterial.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
    in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
    business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
    its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
    individually or in the aggregate will not be material to the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.
    Current litigation is described in Item 3, Legal
    Proceedings.

The Company has long-term liabilities for deferred employee
    compensation, including pension and supplemental executive
    retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental
    retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent
    upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether
    the employee elects lump-sum or annuity payments. During fiscal
    year 2008, the Company expects to contribute approximately
    $3.5 million to $7.0 million to the Company’s
    pension plans. Capital expenditures in 2008 are expected to be
    at similar levels expended in 2007 to support the growth in the
    business.

FIN 48, which became effective on January 1, 2007,
    requires financial statement reporting of the expected future
    tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on
    the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full
    knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of
    the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any
    discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value
    of money. If all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits
    accrued as of December 31, 2007 were to become recognizable
    in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of
    approximately $67.0 million in the income tax provision. As
    of December 31, 2007, however, the Company is not able to
    estimate the portion of that total potential reduction that may
    occur within the next twelve months. As a result, this
    information is not disclosed in the above table.



The Company is not aware of any undisclosed risks and
    uncertainties, including, but not limited to, product technical
    obsolescence, regulatory compliance, protection of intellectual
    property rights, changes in pharmaceutical industry spending,
    competitive advantages, current and pending litigation, and
    changes in foreign exchange rates, that are reasonably likely to
    occur and could materially and negatively affect the
    Company’s existing cash balance or its ability to borrow
    funds from its credit facility. The Company also believes there
    are no provisions in its credit facilities, its real estate
    leases or supplier and collaborative agreements that would
    accelerate payments, require additional collateral or impair its
    ability to continue to enter into critical transactions. The
    Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any
    dividends in the foreseeable future.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Company has not created, and is not party to, any
    special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of
    raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its
    business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the
    Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated
    financial statements. The Company has not entered into any
    transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has
    subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other
    contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material
    continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation
    under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that
    provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk
    support to the Company.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Summary

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
    requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect
    the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.
    Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the
    presentation of the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations that require management to make estimates
    about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a
    material impact on the Company’s results of operations
    given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to
    occur from period to period or use of different estimates that
    reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an
    ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates.
    The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
    various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements that require
    estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes
    in estimates used in these and other items could potentially
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
    product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
    Partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or
    performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the
    consolidated balance sheets. Once the product is shipped, all
    advance payments received associated with that particular order
    are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the
    customer invoice. Shipping and handling costs are included in
    cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the
    order. The Company’s products generally carry one year of
    warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once
    the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a
    service contract. Service contract billings are generally
    invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term
    and revenue is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
    contract term. At December 31, 2007, the Company had
    current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities of
    approximately $87.3 million and $13.3 million,
    respectively.

Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
    evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
    until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
    specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted
    accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility
    is not reasonably assured. The Company’s method of revenue
    recognition for certain products requiring installation is in
    accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”)
    104, “Revenue Recognition in Financial



Statements”. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when all of
    the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendor’s fee
    is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured
    and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria
    with contractual cash holdback are specified. With respect to
    installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash
    holdback or the fair value of the installation service is
    deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized
    as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete.
    The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon
    a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates,
    estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged
    by third parties. The Company believes that this amount
    approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the
    installation effort.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with Statement
    of Position (“SOP”)

97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition”, as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions”. Software revenue is recognized upon shipment
    as typically no significant post-delivery obligations remain.
    Software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service
    contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the
    service contract.

Loss
    Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
    to make required payments. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
    impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
    allowances may be required. The Company does not request
    collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced
    through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit.
    The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors
    including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the
    customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends
    and the macro-economic environment. Historically, the Company
    has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns
    and allowances are estimates of future product returns related
    to current period revenue. Material differences may result in
    the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management
    made different judgments or utilized different estimates for
    sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The
    Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31,
    2007 was $317.8 million, net of allowances for doubtful
    accounts and sales returns of $9.6 million.

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
    or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis (“FIFO”). The Company estimates
    revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical
    obsolescence; historical demand; projections of future demand,
    including that in the Company’s current backlog of orders;
    and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or
    market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional write-downs may be required. The
    Company’s inventory balance at December 31, 2007 was
    $175.9 million, net of write-downs to net realizable value
    of $11.3 million.

Long-Lived
    Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles,
    long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could
    trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to,
    the following:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
    projected future operating results;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends; and,

•

significant changes or developments in strategic technological
    collaborations or legal matters which affect the Company’s
    capitalized patent, trademark and intellectual properties, such
    as licenses.

When the Company determines that the carrying value of
    intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill may not be
    recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above
    indicators, it measures any impairment based on a projected
    discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by
    management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the
    Company’s current business model. Net intangible assets,
    long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $141.8 million,
    $160.9 million and $272.6 million, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2007. The Company performs annual impairment
    reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual review
    during 2007 and currently does not expect to record an
    impairment charge in the foreseeable future. However, there



can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are
    completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded.

Warranty

Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
    engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
    including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its
    component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is
    affected by product failure rates, material usage and service
    delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should
    actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery
    costs differ from the Company’s previous estimates,
    revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
    At December 31, 2007, the Company’s warranty liability
    was $13.1 million.

Income
    Taxes

As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes
    in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process
    involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure
    together with assessing changes in temporary differences
    resulting from differing treatment of items, such as
    depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and
    accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
    assets and liabilities, which are included within the
    consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results
    differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these
    estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish
    an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact
    its financial position and results of operations.

SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”,
    requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of
    establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax
    assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that
    actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future
    periods. In addition, the Company adopted FIN 48 as of
    January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires financial statement
    reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain
    tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all
    relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax
    reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the
    related tax effects for the time value of money. The
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
    2007 were $68.5 million.

Litigation

As described in Item 3 of Part I of this

Form 10-K,

the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters.
    With respect to each pending claim, management determines
    whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable
    and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when
    management has determined, with respect to a particular claim,
    both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate
    the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to
    either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in
    that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose
    additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to
    considerable interpretation.

With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management
    of the Company to date has been able to make this determination
    and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims
    described in Item 3. As developments occur in these matters
    and additional information becomes available, management of the
    Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their
    range, which may result in its recording charges or additional
    charges which could materially impact the Company’s results
    of operation or financial position.

Pension
    and Other Retirement Benefits

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
    and the fair values of plan assets for the Company’s
    pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated
    periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on
    relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the
    discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated
    and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.00% for its
    Waters Retirement Plan, which is the majority of the
    Company’s benefit obligation and expense.



At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount
    rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined
    the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and
    Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments
    and the Moody’s Aa interest rate as of December 31,
    2007 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash
    flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once
    the interest rates were determined, the plan’s cash flow
    was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement
    date. At December 31, 2007, the Company determined this
    rate to be 6.40% for the Waters Retirement Plan, which is the
    majority of the Company’s 2007 benefit obligation and 2008
    expense. Retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as
    those used by the Company’s defined benefit pension plan in
    accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
    other than Pensions.”

A one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate
    would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for
    the Waters Retirement Plan by approximately $0.3 million. A
    one-quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long-term
    rate of return would decrease the Company’s net periodic
    benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by approximately
    $0.2 million.

Stock-based
    Compensation

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1,
    2006. This standard requires that all share-based payments to
    employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on
    their fair values. The Company has used the Black-Scholes model
    to determine the fair value of its stock option awards. Under
    the fair-value recognition provisions of this statement,
    share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
    over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of
    share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment,
    including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock
    option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ
    significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation
    expense and the Company’s results of operations could be
    materially impacted. As stock-based compensation expense
    recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based
    on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of
    expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
    Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If
    factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in
    the application of SFAS No. 123(R), the compensation
    expense that the Company records in the future periods may
    differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the
    current period.

The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method
    permitted under SFAS No. 123(R) and, consequently, has
    not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified
    transition method, compensation costs associated with awards for
    2007 and 2006 now include expense relating to the remaining
    unvested awards granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the
    expense related to any awards issued subsequent to
    December 31, 2005. The Company recognizes the expense using
    the straight-line attribution method.

The after-tax stock-based compensation and the impact to diluted
    earnings per share of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) for the
    years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were
    $20.0 million with a $0.19 per share reduction to diluted
    earnings per share and $20.6 million with a $0.20 per share
    reduction to diluted earnings per share, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company has capitalized stock-based
    compensation costs of $0.4 million and $1.6 million to
    inventory and capitalized software, respectively, in the
    consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company has capitalized stock-based compensation costs of
    $0.6 million and $1.0 million to inventory and
    capitalized software, respectively, in the consolidated balance
    sheets. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the
    Company used the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed
    by Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees”, and related interpretations, including FASB
    Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 44, “Accounting
    for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation”, for
    its plans. Under this accounting method, stock option
    compensation awards that are granted with the exercise price at
    the current fair value of the Company’s common stock as of
    the date of the award generally did not require compensation
    expense to be recognized in the consolidated statements of
    operations. Stock-based compensation expense recognized for the
    Company’s fixed employee stock option plans, restricted
    stock and employee stock purchase plan was $0.8 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005.



As of December 31, 2007, unrecognized compensation costs
    and related weighted-average lives over which the costs will be
    amortized were as follows (in millions):

Recent
    Accounting Standards Changes

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109”. This interpretation
    prescribes the methodology by which a company must measure,
    report, present and disclose in its financial statements the
    effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that a
    company has taken or expects to take. The interpretation
    requires financial statement reporting of the expected future
    tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on
    the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full
    knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of
    the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any
    discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value
    of money. In addition, the interpretation mandates expanded
    financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in tax
    reporting positions. The interpretation is effective for all
    financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard did have a
    material effect on the Company’s financial position. See
    Note 9, “Income Taxes”, in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information as
    to the impact of adopting this pronouncement.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”. This standard addresses how
    companies should measure fair value when they are required to
    use a fair-value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes
    under GAAP. This standard is effective for all financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. Relative to SFAS No. 157, the
    FASB proposed FASB Staff Positions (“FSP”)

157-a,

157-b
    and 157-c.

FSP 157-a

amends SFAS No. 157 to exclude SFAS No. 13,
    “Accounting for Leases”, and its related interpretive
    accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions,
    while FSP 157-b delays the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for all non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    recurring basis. FSP 157-c clarifies the principles in
    SFAS No. 157 on the fair value measurement of
    liabilities. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether
    this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115”, which is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. This statement permits
    an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value at specified election dates.
    Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
    fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings.
    The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption
    of this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations”, which replaces
    SFAS No. 141. This revised standard requires assets,
    liabilities and non-controlling interests acquired to be
    measured at fair value and requires that costs incurred to
    effect the acquisition be recognized separately from the
    business combination. In addition, this statement expands the
    scope to include all transactions and other events in which one
    entity obtains control over one or more businesses. This
    statement is effective for all business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the
    adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51”. This
    statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement is effective for
    fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The
    Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of
    this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its
    exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes
    other than trading, in accordance with the Company’s
    overall risk management guidelines.

The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange-rate risk
    with respect to certain inter-company balances, forecasted
    transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro,
    Japanese Yen and British Pound. The Company manages its foreign
    currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the
    Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account
    offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the
    Company utilizes derivative and non-derivative financial
    instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency
    fluctuations.

The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and
    cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
    interest rates. The Company’s policy is to manage interest
    costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that
    management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix
    in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered
    into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to
    exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed
    and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an
    agreed upon notional amount.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
    to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
    related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In
    August 2007, the Company entered into two floating-to-fixed-rate
    interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of
    $50.0 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October
    2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan
    facility of its outstanding debt. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Company recorded a cumulative net
    pre-tax unrealized loss of $1.3 million in accumulated
    other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a
    floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swap, with a notional
    amount of $200.0 million and maturity date of June 2007, to
    hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of
    its outstanding debt. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    the Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax realized gain of
    $0.5 million and, in December 2006, the Company closed out
    the swap, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $0.4 million. The
    gain was deferred and has been recognized in earnings in 2007
    over the original term of the interest rate swap. For the year
    ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative
    net pre-tax unrealized loss of $0.2 million in accumulated
    other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a
    floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swap, with a notional
    amount of $125.0 million and maturity date of
    21 months, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term
    loan tranche of its outstanding debt. The Company subsequently
    closed out the swap in the second quarter of 2004 and
    $0.9 million of the total $1.6 million realized gain
    was recognized in earnings in 2005 through the original term of
    the interest rate swap.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points
    in interest rates, the fair market value of the
    floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swap would decrease by
    approximately $1.3 million.

Hedges of
    Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
    throughout the world, with approximately 35% of its sales
    denominated in Euros, 9% in Japanese Yen and smaller sales
    exposures in other currencies in 2007. As a result, the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in



foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses cross-currency
    interest rate swaps, forward contracts and range forward
    contracts to hedge its stockholders’ equity balance from
    the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These
    agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net
    investment in foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in
    the fair value of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements,
    forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the
    change in the value of the hedged net assets of the
    Company’s consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these
    derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective
    hedge of certain foreign net assets of the Company.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company hedged its net
    investment in Euro foreign affiliates with cross-currency
    interest rate swaps, with notional values ranging from
    $30.0 million to $100.0 million. At December 31,
    2007, the Company had no outstanding cross-currency interest
    rate swaps contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
    $10.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    which consists of realized losses of $10.0 million. At
    December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the outstanding
    contracts totaled $100.0 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax losses of $11.0 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of
    $9.7 million and unrealized losses of $1.3 million. At
    December 31, 2005, the notional amount of the outstanding
    contracts totaled $50.0 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax gains of $0.7 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of
    $0.7 million relating to closed Euro cross-currency
    interest rate swap agreements.

During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in Japanese
    Yen foreign affiliates with Japanese Yen cross-currency interest
    rate swaps, with notional values ranging from $26.0 million
    to $37.0 million. At December 31, 2005, the Company
    had no outstanding Japanese Yen cross-currency interest rate
    swap contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax realized losses of
    $0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on
    the closed Japanese Yen cross-currency interest rate swap
    agreements.

During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in British
    Pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in
    British Pounds ranging from £25.0 million to
    £75.0 million. Under the terms of the agreements, the
    Company purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell
    British Pounds and sells an option to their counterparties above
    the current spot rate to buy British Pounds, with option
    premiums that offset. At December 31, 2005, the Company had
    outstanding range forward agreements in British Pounds with
    notional amounts totaling £30.0 million. For the year
    ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative
    net pre-tax gain of $6.1 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of
    $5.8 million related to the closed range forward agreements
    and unrealized gains of $0.3 million related to the open
    British Pound range forward agreements.

During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in British
    Pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts
    in British Pounds. At December 31, 2005, the Company had no
    forward exchange contracts in British Pounds used to hedge its
    net investment position. For the year ended December 31,
    2005, the Company recorded a realized gain of $1.6 million.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
    principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain inter-company balances. Principal hedged currencies
    include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of
    these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
    and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be
    consistent with changes in inter-company balances. Gains and
    losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
    administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
    operations. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional
    amounts totaling approximately $101.4 million,
    $70.9 million and $72.9 million, respectively. For the
    year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded
    cumulative net pre-tax gains of $2.4 million, which
    consists of realized gains of $3.2 million relating to the
    closed forward contracts and $0.8 million of unrealized
    losses relating to the open forward contracts. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative
    net pre-tax gains of $3.9 million, which consists of
    realized gains of $2.5 million relating to the closed
    forward contracts and $1.4 million of unrealized gains
    relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the



Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $0.5 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $1.5 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1.0 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end
    exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the
    fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of
    December 31, 2007 would decrease earnings by approximately
    $10.1 million.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations
    from the investments of cash generated from operations. The
    Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days
    or less, in commercial paper rated A1 or A1+ by
    Standard & Poors and P1 by Moody’s Investors
    Service; bank deposits; repurchase agreements;
    U.S. Government Agency Debt and AAA rated money market
    funds. Similar investments with longer maturities are classified
    as short-term investments. Cash equivalents and short-term
    investments are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry
    an insignificant risk of change in market value. The Company
    maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of
    federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in
    currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31,
    2007, the Company has no holdings in auction rate securities or
    commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles,
    collateralized debt obligation conduits or asset-backed conduits.

The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk
    due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of
    December 31, 2007, the carrying value of our cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments approximated fair value.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
    detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2007.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
    herein.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    related consolidated statements of operations, of
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and of cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007 based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

As discussed in Notes 9, 13 and 16 to the consolidated
    financial statements, respectively, the Company changed the
    manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions
    effective January 1, 2007, share-based compensation
    effective January 1, 2006 and defined benefit pension and
    other postretirement plans effective December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Description
    of Business, Organization and Basis of Presentation

Waters Corporation (“Waters” or the
    “Company”), an analytical instrument manufacturer,
    designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters
    Division, high performance liquid chromatography
    (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid
    chromatography

®

(“UPLC” and together with HPLC, herein referred to as
    “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”)
    instrument systems and support products, including
    chromatography columns, other consumable products and
    comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are
    complementary products that can be integrated together and used
    along with other analytical instruments. LC is a standard
    technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to
    detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and
    biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range
    of compounds. MS instruments are used in drug discovery and
    development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of
    proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”)
    and environmental testing. LC is often combined with MS to
    create LC-MS instruments that include a liquid phase sample
    introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric
    compound identification and quantification. Through its TA
    Division (“TA”), the Company designs, manufactures,
    sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry
    instruments which are used in predicting the suitability of
    polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer
    goods and healthcare products. The Company is also a developer
    and supplier of software based products that interface with the
    Company’s instruments and are typically purchased by
    customers as part of the instrument system.


Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and
    judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company
    evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
    recognition, product returns and allowances, bad debts,
    inventory valuation, equity investments, goodwill and intangible
    assets, income taxes, warranty and installation provisions,
    retirement plan obligations, stock-based compensation,
    contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on
    historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
    believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
    of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Risks and
    Uncertainties

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the
    analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to,
    development by its competitors of new technological innovations,
    dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of
    proprietary technology, fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates and compliance with regulations of the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign
    regulatory authorities and agencies.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified in the
    accompanying financial statements in order to be consistent with
    the current year’s classifications.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly
    owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or
    controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All
    material inter-company balances and transactions have been
    eliminated.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and
    liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange
    rates prevailing on the balance sheet date while revenues and
    expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing
    during the period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
    consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s net sales
    derived from operations outside the United States were 68% in
    2007, 68% in 2006 and 66% in 2005. Gains and losses from foreign
    currency transactions are included in net income in the
    consolidated statements of operations and were not material for
    the years presented.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents primarily represent highly liquid investments,
    with original maturities of generally 90 days or less, in
    commercial paper rated A1 or A1+ by Standard &
    Poor’s and P1 by Moody’s Investors Service; bank
    deposits; repurchase agreements; U.S. Government Agency
    Debt and AAA rated money market funds which are convertible to a
    known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change
    in market value. Similar investments with longer maturities are
    classified as short-term investments. The Company maintains
    balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally
    insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies
    other than U.S. dollars.

Short-Term
    Investments

At December 31, 2007, short-term investments were
    classified as available-for-sale in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115,
    “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities”. All available-for-sale securities are recorded
    at fair market value and any unrealized holding gains and
    losses, to the extent deemed temporary, are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder’s
    equity, net of the related tax effects. Realized gains and
    losses are determined on the specific identification method and
    are included in other income (expense) net. If any adjustment to
    fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment we
    consider all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which
    the decline is “other than temporary” and mark the
    investment to market through a charge to our statement of
    operations. The Company classifies its investments as short-term
    investments exclusive of those categorized as cash equivalents.
    At December 31, 2007, the Company had short term
    investments with a cost of $95.7 million which approximated
    market value.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products and services to a significant
    number of large and small customers throughout the world, with
    net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately 52% in
    2007, 52% in 2006 and 54% in 2005. None of the Company’s
    individual customers accounted for more than 3% of annual
    Company sales in 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company performs
    continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
    does not require collateral, but in certain circumstances may
    require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company
    has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

Seasonality
    of Business

The Company experiences an increase in sales in the fourth
    quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of
    customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by
    calendar year end.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
    the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the
    existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number
    of factors, including historical experience and the
    customer’s credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful
    accounts is reviewed at least on a quarterly basis. Past due
    balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are
    reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are
    charged against the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

allowance when the Company feels it is probable that the
    receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any
    off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s
    allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands):

Inventory

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
    or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis (“FIFO”).

Income
    Taxes

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109” (“FIN 48”). This
    interpretation prescribes the methodology by which a company
    must measure, report, present and disclose in its financial
    statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting
    positions that a company has taken or expects to take. See
    Note 9, “Income Taxes”, for additional
    information.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences
    between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets
    and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which
    the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance
    is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon
    the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or
    all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures
    for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense while the
    costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation
    is provided using the straight-line method over the following
    estimated useful lives: buildings — fifteen to thirty
    years; building improvements — five to ten years;
    leasehold improvements — the shorter of the economic
    useful life or life of lease; and production and other
    equipment — three to ten years. Upon retirement or
    sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related
    accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated
    balance sheets and related gains or losses are reflected in the
    consolidated statements of operations. There were no material
    gains or losses from retirement or sale of assets in 2007, 2006
    and 2005.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests for goodwill impairment using a fair-value
    approach at the reporting unit level annually, or earlier, if an
    event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
    not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
    amount. Additionally, the Company has elected to make January 1
    the annual impairment assessment date for its reporting units.
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets”, defines a reporting unit as an operating segment,
    or one level below an operating segment, if discrete financial
    information is prepared and reviewed by management. Goodwill is
    allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition.
    Under the impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying
    amount exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is
    recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill
    exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value
    of reporting units were estimated using a discounted cash flows
    technique, which includes certain management assumptions, such
    as estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and
    discount rates.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s intangible assets include purchased
    technology; capitalized software development costs; costs
    associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and
    intellectual properties, such as licenses; and debt issuance
    costs. Purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market
    values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their
    estimated useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years. Other
    intangibles are amortized over a period ranging from one to
    thirteen years. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life
    of the related debt.

Software
    Development Costs

The Company capitalizes software development costs for products
    offered for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 86,
    “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
    Leased, or Otherwise Marketed”. Capitalized costs are
    amortized to cost of sales over the period of economic benefit,
    which approximates a straight-line basis over the estimated
    useful lives of the related software products, generally three
    to five years.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs in
    accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”)

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”. Capitalized internal software
    development costs are amortized over the period of economic
    benefit which approximates a straight-line basis over ten years.
    At December 31, 2007 and 2006, capitalized internal
    software included in property, plant and equipment totaled
    $2.0 million and $1.7 million, net of accumulated
    amortization of $4.1 million and $3.6 million,
    respectively.

Investments

The Company accounts for its investments that represent less
    than twenty percent ownership using SFAS No. 115.
    Investments for which the Company does not have the ability to
    exercise significant influence and for which there is not a
    readily determinable market value are accounted for under the
    cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates
    the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the
    cost method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost
    or estimated net realizable value. For investments in which the
    Company owns or controls between twenty and forty-nine percent
    of the voting shares, or over which it exerts significant
    influence over operating and financial policies, the equity
    method of accounting is used. The Company’s share of net
    income or losses of equity investments is included in the
    consolidated statements of operations and was not material in
    any period presented.

All investments at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are included
    in other assets and amounted to $7.5 million and
    $5.3 million, respectively. See Note 5, “Business
    Investments”, for net other-than-temporary impairment
    charges taken in 2006 and 2005 for certain equity investments.

Asset
    Impairments

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Whenever
    events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
    asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the fair
    value of the asset, relying on a number of factors, including,
    but not limited to, operating results, business plans, economic
    projections and anticipated future cash flows. Any change in the
    carrying amount of an asset as a result of the Company’s
    evaluation is separately identified in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Fair
    Values of Financial Instruments

Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
    investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt
    approximate cost.

Stockholders’
    Equity

In February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million
    of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During
    2007, the Company repurchased 2.8 million shares at



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

a cost of $166.1 million under this program. The Company
    repurchased 3.4 million, 5.8 million and
    15.4 million shares at a cost of $200.5 million,
    $249.2 million and $659.3 million during 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively, under the February 2007 and previously
    announced programs. The Company believes it has the resources to
    fund the common stock repurchases as well as to pursue
    acquisition opportunities in the future.

On August 9, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the
    adoption of a stock purchase rights plan where a dividend of one
    fractional preferred share purchase right (a “Right”)
    was declared for each outstanding share of common stock, par
    value $0.01 per share, of the Company. The dividend was paid on
    August 27, 2002 to the stockholders of record on that date.
    The Rights, which expire on August 27, 2012, become
    exercisable only under certain conditions. When they first
    become exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to buy
    from Waters one one-hundredth of a share of new Series A
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock (authorized limit of 4,000)
    for $120.00. When a person or group actually has acquired 15% or
    more of Waters’ common stock, the Rights will then become
    exercisable for a number of shares of Waters’ common stock
    with a market value of twice the $120.00 exercise price of each
    Right. In addition, the Rights will then become exercisable for
    a number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company with
    a market value of twice the $120.00 exercise price per Right.
    The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at a price of
    $0.001 per Right up until 10 days following a public
    announcement that any person or group has acquired 15% or more
    of the Company’s common stock.

Hedge
    Transactions

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended, which
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
    instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
    in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives,
    whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required
    to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value
    as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated
    as a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged
    risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated
    as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the
    fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive
    income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item
    affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value
    are recognized in earnings.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage
    exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The
    Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to
    minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most
    effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign
    currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and
    links all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or net
    investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
    consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted
    transactions. The Company also assesses and documents, both at
    the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
    effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows
    associated with the hedged items.

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates and interest rates.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
    to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
    related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In
    August 2007, the Company entered into two floating-to-fixed-rate
    interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of
    $50.0 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October
    2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan
    facility of its outstanding debt. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Company recorded a cumulative net
    pre-tax unrealized loss of $1.3 million in accumulated
    other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a
    floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swap, with a notional
    amount of $200.0 million and maturity date of June 2007, to
    hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of
    its outstanding debt. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    the Company recorded a cumulative net



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

pre-tax realized gain of $0.5 million and, in December
    2006, the Company closed out the swap, resulting in a pre-tax
    gain of $0.4 million. The gain was deferred and has been
    recognized in earnings in 2007 over the original term of the
    interest rate swap. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
    the Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax unrealized loss of
    $0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on
    this interest rate swap agreement.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a
    floating-to-fixed-rate interest rate swap, with a notional
    amount of $125.0 million and maturity date of
    21 months, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term
    loan tranche of its outstanding debt. The Company subsequently
    closed out the swap in the second quarter of 2004 and
    $0.9 million of the total $1.6 million realized gain
    was recognized in earnings in 2005 through the original term of
    the interest rate swap.

Hedges of
    Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
    throughout the world, with approximately 35% of its sales
    denominated in Euros, 9% in Japanese Yen and smaller sales
    exposures in other currencies in 2007. As a result, the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates. The Company uses cross-currency interest rate
    swaps, forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge
    its stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are
    designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in
    foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value
    of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements, forward
    contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in
    the value of the hedged net assets of the Company’s
    consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these derivative
    instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of
    certain foreign net assets of the Company.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company hedged its net
    investment in Euro foreign affiliates with cross-currency
    interest rate swaps, with notional values ranging from
    $30.0 million to $100.0 million. At December 31,
    2007, the Company had no outstanding cross-currency interest
    rate swaps contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
    $10.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    which consists of realized losses of $10.0 million. At
    December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the outstanding
    contracts totaled $100.0 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax losses of $11.0 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of
    $9.7 million and unrealized losses of $1.3 million. At
    December 31, 2005, the notional amount of the outstanding
    contracts totaled $50.0 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax gains of $0.7 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of
    $0.7 million relating to closed Euro cross-currency
    interest rate swap agreements.

During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in Japanese
    Yen foreign affiliates with Japanese Yen cross-currency interest
    rate swaps, with notional values ranging from $26.0 million
    to $37.0 million. At December 31, 2005, the Company
    had no outstanding Japanese Yen cross-currency interest rate
    swap contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax realized losses of
    $0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on
    the closed Japanese Yen cross-currency interest rate swap
    agreements.

During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in British
    Pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in
    British Pounds ranging from £25.0 million to
    £75.0 million. Under the terms of the agreements, the
    Company purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell
    British Pounds and sells an option to their counterparties above
    the current spot rate to buy British Pounds, with option
    premiums that offset. At December 31, 2005, the Company had
    outstanding range forward agreements in British Pounds with
    notional amounts totaling £30.0 million. For the year
    ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative
    net pre-tax gain of $6.1 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of
    $5.8 million related to the closed range forward agreements
    and unrealized gains of $0.3 million related to the open
    British Pound range forward agreements.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in British
    Pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts
    in British Pounds. At December 31, 2005, the Company had no
    forward exchange contracts in British Pounds used to hedge its
    net investment position. For the year ended December 31,
    2005, the Company recorded a realized gain of $1.6 million.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
    principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain inter-company balances. Principal hedged currencies
    include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of
    these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
    and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be
    consistent with changes in inter-company balances. Gains and
    losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
    administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
    operations. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional
    amounts totaling approximately $101.4 million,
    $70.9 million and $72.9 million, respectively. For the
    year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded
    cumulative net pre-tax gains of $2.4 million, which
    consists of realized gains of $3.2 million relating to the
    closed forward contracts and $0.8 million of unrealized
    losses relating to the open forward contracts. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative
    net pre-tax gains of $3.9 million, which consists of
    realized gains of $2.5 million relating to the closed
    forward contracts and $1.4 million of unrealized gains
    relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax gains of $0.5 million, which consists of realized
    gains of $1.5 million relating to the closed forward
    contracts and $1.0 million of unrealized losses relating to
    the open forward contracts.

Revenue
    Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
    product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
    Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
    evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
    until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
    specifying fixed terms and prices. Proceeds received in advance
    of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as
    deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Shipping
    and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts
    invoiced to the customer per the order.

The Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain
    products requiring installation is in accordance with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, “Revenue
    Recognition in Financial Statements”. Accordingly, revenue
    is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
    occurred; the vendor’s fee is fixed or determinable;
    collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon
    acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash
    holdback are specified. With respect to installation
    obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the
    fair value of the installation service is deferred when the
    product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple
    element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company
    determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of
    factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated
    installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third
    parties.

The Company recognizes product revenue when legal title has
    transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company
    structures its sales arrangements as FOB shipping point or
    international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue
    upon shipment. In some cases, FOB destination based shipping
    terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue
    is recognized when the products arrive at the customer site.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales
    arrangements. Revenue associated with products that contain
    specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized before
    the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. Discounts from
    list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with

SOP 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition”, as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Transactions”. Software revenue is recognized upon shipment
    as typically no significant post-delivery obligations remain.
    Software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service
    contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the
    service contract.

The Company assists customers in obtaining financing with an
    independent third-party leasing company with respect to certain
    product sales. Revenue is generally recognized upon product
    shipment under these arrangements. The Company receives payment
    from the leasing company shortly after shipment, provided
    delivery and credit documentation meets contractual criteria.
    The customer is obligated to pay the leasing company but the
    Company retains some credit risk if the customer is unable to
    pay. Accordingly, the Company reduces revenue equal to
    pre-established loss-pool criteria, including contracts with
    recourse. The Company’s credit risk is significantly
    reduced through loss-pool limitations and re-marketing rights in
    the event of a default.

Product
    Warranty Costs

The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time
    of sale which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated
    statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive
    product quality programs and processes, including actively
    monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies,
    the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product
    failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs
    incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the
    accrued warranty liability is based on historical information,
    such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units
    repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The
    liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s
    accrued warranty liability for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands):

Advertising
    Costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included
    in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated
    statements of operations. Advertising expenses for 2007, 2006
    and 2005 were $6.0 million, $7.9 million and
    $8.5 million, respectively.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised of costs
    incurred in performing research and development activities,
    including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead
    costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and
    development expenses are expensed as incurred.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company has two stock-based compensation plans, which are
    described in Note 13, “Stock-Based Compensation”.

Income
    Per Share

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per
    Share”, the Company presents two earnings per share
    (“EPS”) amounts. Income per basic common share is
    based on income available to common shareholders and the
    weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
    periods presented. Income per diluted common share



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

includes additional dilution from potential common stock, such
    as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options
    outstanding.

Comprehensive
    Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with
    SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive
    Income”. The statement establishes standards for reporting
    and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full
    set of general-purpose financial statements. The statement
    requires that all components of comprehensive income be reported
    in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
    prominence as other financial statements.

Recent
    Accounting Standards Changes

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109”. This interpretation
    prescribes the methodology by which a company must measure,
    report, present and disclose in its financial statements the
    effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that a
    company has taken or expects to take. The interpretation
    requires financial statement reporting of the expected future
    tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on
    the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full
    knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of
    the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any
    discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value
    of money. In addition, the interpretation mandates expanded
    financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in tax
    reporting positions. The interpretation is effective for all
    financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard did have a
    material effect on the Company’s financial position. See
    Note 9, “Income Taxes”, for additional
    information as to the impact of adopting this pronouncement.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”. This standard addresses how
    companies should measure fair value when they are required to
    use a fair-value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes
    under GAAP. This standard is effective for all financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. Relative to SFAS No. 157, the
    FASB proposed FASB Staff Positions (“FSP”)

157-a,

157-b
    and 157-c.

FSP 157-a

amends SFAS No. 157 to exclude SFAS No. 13,
    “Accounting for Leases”, and its related interpretive
    accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions,
    while FSP 157-b delays the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for all non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    recurring basis. FSP 157-c clarifies the principles in
    SFAS No. 157 on the fair value measurement of
    liabilities. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether
    this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115”, which is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. This statement permits
    an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value at specified election dates.
    Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
    fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings.
    The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption
    of this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations”, which replaces
    SFAS No. 141. This revised standard requires assets,
    liabilities and non-controlling interests acquired to be
    measured at fair value and requires that costs incurred to
    effect the acquisition be recognized separately from the
    business combination. In addition, this statement expands the
    scope to include all transactions and other events in which one
    entity obtains control over one or more businesses. This
    statement is effective for all business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the
    adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51”. This
    statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement is effective for
    fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The
    Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of
    this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Business
    Investments

In June 2007, the Company made an equity investment in Thar
    Instruments, Inc., a privately held global leader in the design,
    development and manufacture of analytical and preparative
    supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid
    extraction systems, for $3.5 million in cash. This
    investment is accounted for under the cost method of accounting.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
    $5.8 million charge for an other-than-temporary impairment
    to an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
    (“Caprion”). The charge was recorded in 2006 when the
    Company was notified that Caprion’s financial condition had
    deteriorated and that a merger was occurring that, in the
    Company’s assessment, would result in the Company’s
    investment being substantially diminished. In March 2007,
    Caprion merged with Ecopia BioSciences Inc. and is now named
    Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Thallion”). Thallion
    is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the
    Company’s investment is accounted for under
    SFAS No. 115. The market value of the Thallion
    investment was approximately $0.3 million and
    $1.7 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2005, the Company recorded a $4.8 million pre-tax charge
    for an other-than-temporary impairment for the full value of the
    Company’s investment in Beyond Genomics, Inc. (“Beyond
    Genomics”). This charge was recorded based on the
    Company’s assessment of Beyond Genomics’ current
    financial condition and uncertainty surrounding their ability to
    raise necessary funding.

In June 2000, the Company formed a strategic alliance with
    Variagenics, Inc. (“Variagenics”), a publicly traded
    company, to develop and commercialize genetic variance reagent
    kits for use in the clinical development of pharmaceutical
    products. Variagenics was considered a leader in applying
    genetic variance information to the drug development process. In
    July 2000, the Company paid Variagenics $7.5 million for a
    minority common stock equity ownership. The investment in
    Variagenics was included in other assets and carried at market
    value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate
    component of other comprehensive income (loss). On
    January 31, 2003, Variagenics was merged with Hyseq
    Pharmaceuticals and is now named Nuvelo, Inc.
    (“Nuvelo”). In 2005, the Company sold its Nuvelo
    common stock for $2.5 million resulting in a gain of
    $1.7 million which was recorded in other income in the
    consolidated statements of operations.


Acquisitions

Environmental
    Resources Associates

In December 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Environmental Resources Associates, Inc.
    (“ERA”), a provider of environmental testing products
    for quality control, proficiency testing and specialty
    calibration chemicals used in environmental laboratories, for
    approximately $61.8 million, including $0.4 million of
    acquisition-related transaction costs, and the assumption of
    $3.8 million of debt. This acquisition was accounted for
    under the purchase method of accounting and the results of
    operations of ERA have been included in the consolidated results
    of the Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of
    the acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets
    and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values.
    The Company has allocated $29.9 million of the purchase
    price to intangible assets comprised of customer relationships,
    non-compete agreements, acquired technology and other purchased
    intangibles. The Company is amortizing the customer
    relationships, acquired technology and other purchased
    intangibles over ten years. The non-compete agreements are being
    amortized over five years. These intangible assets are being
    amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately ten
    years. Included in intangible assets is a trademark in the
    amount of $3.7 million that has been assigned an indefinite
    life. ERA was acquired because the Company believes its existing
    distribution channels can be leveraged with ERA’s strong
    reputation within environmental laboratories. The excess
    purchase price of $44.6 million after this allocation has
    been accounted for as goodwill and reflects a reimbursement of
    $0.7 million received in the first quarter of 2007 from the
    sellers in connection with finalization of the purchase price in
    accordance with the purchase and sales agreement. The sellers
    also have provided the Company with normal representations,
    warranties and indemnification which would be settled in the
    future if and when the contractual representation or warranty
    condition occurs. The goodwill is not deductible for tax
    purposes.

    food safety business of VICAM Limited Partnership
    (“VICAM”) for approximately $13.8 million,
    including $0.3 million of acquisition-related transaction
    costs. This acquisition was accounted for under the purchase
    method of accounting and the results of operations of VICAM have
    been included in the consolidated results of the Company from
    the acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition was
    allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed
    liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The Company
    has allocated $7.7 million of the purchase price to
    intangible assets comprised of customer relationships,
    non-compete agreements, acquired technology and other purchased
    intangibles. The Company is amortizing acquired technology and
    other purchased intangibles over twelve years and customer
    relationships over fifteen years. The non-compete agreements are
    being amortized over five years. These intangible assets are
    being amortized over a weighted-average period of thirteen
    years. Included in intangible assets is a trademark in the
    amount of $2.1 million that has been assigned an indefinite
    life. The excess purchase price of $3.7 million after this
    allocation has been accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is
    deductible for tax purposes.

In October 2007, the Company acquired certain net assets and

    Company has allocated $1.7 million of the

purchase price to intangible assets comprised of customer
    relationships and non-compete agreements. These intangible
    assets are being amortized over a weighted-average period of ten
    years.

In August 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Calorimetry Sciences Corporation
    (“CSC”), a privately held company that designs,
    develops and manufactures highly sensitive calorimeters, for
    approximately $7.1 million in cash, including the
    assumption of $1.1 million of liabilities. This acquisition
    was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and
    the results of operations of CSC have been included in the
    consolidated results of the Company from the acquisition date.
    The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to tangible
    and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their
    estimated fair values. The Company has allocated
    $2.7 million of the purchase price to intangible assets
    comprised of customer relationships, non-compete agreements and
    acquired technology. These intangible assets are being amortized
    over a weighted-average period of nine years. The excess
    purchase price of $5.1 million after this allocation has
    been accounted for as goodwill. CSC was acquired because the
    Company believes that CSC’s products can be marketed to
    TA’s customer base and distribution channels. The sellers
    also have provided the Company with normal representations,
    warranties and indemnification which would be settled in the
    future if and when the contractual representation or warranty
    condition occurs. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

In August 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Thermometric AB (“Thermometric”), a
    manufacturer of high performance micro-calorimeters, and certain
    net assets and customer lists from a Taiwan distributor of
    thermal analysis products for a total of $3.2 million in
    cash. As part of the Thermometric acquisition, the Company
    assumed $1.2 million of debt. These acquisitions were
    accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the
    results of operations of these acquisitions have been included
    in the consolidated results of the Company from the acquisition
    dates. The combined purchase price of the acquisitions was
    allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed
    liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The Company
    has allocated $2.2 million of the combined purchase price
    to intangible assets comprised of customer relationships,
    non-compete agreements and acquired technology. The combined
    excess purchase price of $1.5 million after this allocation
    has been accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is not
    deductible for tax purposes.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

The carrying amount of goodwill was $272.6 million and
    $265.2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to the
    Company’s acquisition of CSC, which added approximately
    $5.1 million of goodwill, partially offset by a
    $0.7 million decrease resulting from a purchase price
    adjustment received from the previous owners of ERA
    (Note 6). Currency translation adjustments increased
    goodwill approximately $3.0 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    acquired approximately $4.4 million of purchased
    intangibles as a result of the acquisitions of CSC and the
    distributor rights from a South Korean distributor of thermal
    analysis products. During the year ended December 31, 2006,
    the Company acquired approximately $39.8 million of
    purchased intangibles as a result of the acquisitions of VICAM,
    Thermometric, ERA and the distributor rights from a Taiwan
    distributor of thermal analysis products. In addition, the gross
    carrying value of intangible assets increased by approximately
    $3.0 million and $2.9 million in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, due to the effect of foreign currency translation.

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    amortization expense for intangible assets was
    $25.9 million, $20.3 million and $20.0 million,
    respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is
    estimated to be approximately $26.2 million for each of the
    next five years. Accumulated amortization for intangible assets
    increased approximately $1.2 million and $1.0 million
    in 2007 and 2006, respectively, due to the effect of foreign
    currency translation.


Debt

In January 2007, Waters Corporation and Waters Technologies
    Ireland Ltd. entered into a new credit agreement (the “2007
    Credit Agreement”). The 2007 Credit Agreement provides for
    a $500 million term loan facility; a $350 million
    revolving facility (“U.S. Tranche”), which
    includes both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility;
    and a $250 million revolving facility (“European
    Tranche”) that is available to Waters Corporation in
    U.S. dollars and Waters Technologies Ireland Ltd. in either
    U.S. dollars or Euros. Waters Corporation may on one or
    more occasions request of the lender group that commitments for
    the U.S. Tranche or European Tranche be increased by an
    amount of not less than $25 million, up to an aggregate
    additional amount of $250 million. Existing lenders are not
    obligated to increase commitments and the Company can seek to
    bring in additional lenders. The term loan facility and the
    revolving facilities both mature on January 11, 2012 and
    require no scheduled prepayments before that date.

In January 2007, the Company borrowed $500 million under
    the new term loan facility, $115 million under the new
    European Tranche and $270 million under the new
    U.S. Tranche revolving facility. The Company used the
    proceeds of the term loan and the revolving borrowings to repay
    the outstanding amounts under the Company’s previous
    multi-borrower credit agreements entered into in December 2004
    and November 2005. Waters Corporation terminated such agreements
    early without penalty.

The interest rates applicable to the term loan and revolving
    loans under the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s
    option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of
    the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus

1/2%)

or the
    applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each
    case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s
    leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and
    72.5 basis points. The facility fee on the 2007 Credit
    Agreement ranges between 7 basis points and 15 basis
    points. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company
    comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than
    3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any
    period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively, the
    same as the terminated credit

agreements. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes
    negative covenants that are customary for investment grade
    credit facilities and are similar in nature to ones contained in
    the terminated credit agreements. The 2007 Credit Agreement also
    contains certain customary representations and warranties,
    affirmative covenants and events of default which are similar in
    nature to those in the terminated credit agreements.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
    $865.0 million borrowed under the 2007 Credit Agreement and
    an amount available to borrow of $233.2 million after
    outstanding letters of credit. In total, $500.0 million of
    the total debt was classified as long-term debt and
    $365.0 million classified as short-term debt at
    December 31, 2007 in the consolidated balance sheets. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had $250.0 million
    borrowed under the 2005 Credit Agreement and $635.0 million
    under the Amended 2004 Credit Agreement for a total of
    $885.0 million borrowed under the two credit agreements and
    an amount available to borrow of $163.4 million after
    outstanding letters of credit. In total, $500.0 million of
    the total debt was classified as long-term debt and
    $385.0 million classified as short-term debt at
    December 31, 2006 in the consolidated balance sheets. The
    weighted-average interest rates applicable to these borrowings
    were 5.67% and 6.02% at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

The Company, and its foreign subsidiaries, also had available
    short-term lines of credit, totaling $98.5 million at
    December 31, 2007 and $96.8 million at
    December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    related short-term borrowings were $19.2 million at a
    weighted-average interest rate of 3.30% and $18.5 million
    at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.21%, respectively.

Net deferred tax assets of $23.5 million and
    $22.1 million are included in other current assets and
    $33.1 million and $40.4 million are included in other
    assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company’s deferred tax assets associated with net
    operating loss, tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum
    tax credits are comprised of the following at December 31,
    2007: $29.8 million ($76.8 million pre-tax) benefit of
    U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards
    that begin to expire in 2020 and 2008, respectively;
    $67.2 million in foreign tax credits, which begin to expire
    in 2009; $7.7 million in research and development credits
    that begin to expire in 2010; and $2.7 million
    ($13.4 million pre-tax) in foreign net operating losses,
    $1.5 million ($7.7 million pre-tax) of which do not
    expire under current law, the remainder of which begin to expire
    in 2008. The Company has excluded the benefit of
    $14.0 million ($37.8 million pre-tax) of
    U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards
    from the deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2007.
    This amount represents an “excess tax benefit”, as the
    term is defined in SFAS No. 123(R), which will be
    recognized as a reduction to the Company’s accrued income
    taxes and an addition to its additional paid-in capital when it
    is realized in the Company’s tax returns.

The Company has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of
    $81.6 million, principally against foreign tax credits
    ($67.2 million), certain foreign net operating losses and
    other deferred tax assets. The benefit relating to foreign tax
    credits and these other deferred tax assets, if realized, will
    be credited to additional paid-in capital.

The income tax benefits associated with non-qualified stock
    option compensation expense recognized for tax purposes and
    credited to additional paid-in capital were $17.0 million,
    $16.5 million and $4.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

At December 31, 2007, there were unremitted earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries of approximately $911.5 million. The
    Company has not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign
    withholding taxes on these earnings as it is the Company’s
    current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside
    the U.S.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”,
    requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of
    establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax
    assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that
    actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future
    periods.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had determined that it
    was more likely than not that the actual tax benefit of
    $167.5 million of its deferred tax assets would not be
    realized. The Company had therefore recorded a cumulative
    $167.5 million valuation allowance to reduce the net
    carrying value of these assets to zero for financial reporting
    purposes as of December 31, 2004. The valuation allowance
    was determined based on the Company’s review of its future
    estimated U.S. taxable income levels and estimated future
    stock option exercises. Included in this $167.5 million
    valuation allowance was $154.9 million related to the
    future tax benefit of U.S. net operating losses generated
    by the exercise of non-qualified stock options. As required by
    SFAS No. 109 and Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
    Stock Issued to Employees”, the Company had originally
    recorded all $154.9 million of these future tax benefits as
    increased additional paid-in capital. Accordingly, when the
    Company recorded a valuation allowance against these future tax
    benefits, the Company also reduced additional paid-in capital by
    $154.9 million.

As required by SFAS No. 109, the Company maintained
    this deferred tax asset valuation allowance until it determined,
    during 2005, that it was more likely than not that it would
    realize the actual tax benefit of $92.5 million of deferred
    tax assets for which a full valuation allowance had been
    previously provided. The Company made this determination based
    on the level of the Company’s actual 2005 U.S. taxable
    income, the Company’s projected future U.S. taxable
    income levels, the Company’s actual 2005 tax deduction from
    the exercise of non-qualified stock options and the fact that
    the Company’s future tax deduction from the exercise of
    non-qualified stock options would most likely be less than in
    the past as those options, which were significantly
    in-the-money, were expiring and exercised by December 31,
    2005. The Company therefore recorded, in 2005, a
    $92.5 million reduction in its deferred tax asset valuation
    allowance. Because this reduction in the valuation allowance
    included $78.8 million related to the future tax benefit of
    U.S. net operating losses generated by the exercise of
    non-qualified stock options, the Company also restored
    $78.8 million to the Company’s additional paid-in
    capital in 2005, in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and
    APB No. 25. The remaining balance was credited to goodwill
    in the consolidated balance sheet.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109”. FIN 48 prescribes the
    methodology by which a company must measure, report, present and
    disclose in its financial statements the effects of any
    uncertain tax return reporting positions that a company has
    taken or expects to take. FIN 48, which became effective on
    January 1, 2007, requires financial statement reporting of
    the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return
    reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax
    authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting
    positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the
    related tax effects for the time value of money. FIN 48
    also mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about
    uncertainty in income tax reporting positions.

The Company implemented the methodology prescribed by
    FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. The Company recorded the
    effect of adopting FIN 48 with a $3.9 million charge
    to beginning retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet
    as of January 1, 2007.

As of January 1, 2007, the Company’s unrecognized tax
    benefits amounted to approximately $62.4 million. For the
    year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded an
    increase of approximately $6.0 million in unrecognized tax
    benefits via the income tax provision for the year. The 2007
    activity in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits is
    summarized as follows (in thousands):

If all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits accrued
    as of December 31, 2007 were to become recognizable in the
    future, the Company would record a total reduction of
    approximately $67.0 million in the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

income tax provision. As of December 31, 2007, however, the
    Company is not able to estimate the portion of that total
    potential reduction that may occur within the next twelve months.

The Company’s accounting policy is to record estimated
    interest and penalties related to the potential underpayment of
    income taxes, net of related tax effects, as a component of the
    income tax provision. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Company included $1.2 million (approximately
    $1.8 million pre-tax) of such interest expense, net of
    related tax benefits, and no income tax penalty expense in the
    income tax provision. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company had accrued approximately $4.0 million
    (approximately $6.0 million pre-tax) and approximately
    $2.8 million (approximately $4.2 million pre-tax),
    respectively, of such estimated interest expense, net of related
    tax benefits. As of both December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company had accrued no income tax penalty expense.

The Company’s uncertain tax positions are taken with
    respect to income tax return reporting periods beginning after
    December 31, 1999, which are the periods that remain
    generally open to income tax audit examination by the various
    income tax authorities that have jurisdiction over the
    Company’s income tax reporting for that period of time. The
    Company has monitored and will continue to monitor the lapsing
    of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for
    related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits,
    related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. As of December 31, 2007, however, the Company
    does not expect to record any material changes in the
    measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest
    and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the
    lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments
    within the next twelve months.

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act
    (“AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA creates a
    temporary incentive for U.S. multi-national corporations to
    repatriate income accumulated abroad by providing an 85%
    dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
    controlled foreign corporations. It previously had been the
    Company’s practice to permanently reinvest all foreign
    earnings into foreign operations. In July 2005, the Board of
    Directors of the Company approved the repatriation of
    $500.0 million as a qualified distribution in accordance
    with the AJCA. The Company has used and will continue to use the
    repatriated cash to fund current and future operating expenses
    within the parameters of Internal Revenue Service guidance.
    During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a tax
    liability of $24.0 million for the federal, state and
    foreign taxes related to the qualified and base period
    distribution in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The
    Company paid $10.0 million of this tax during 2005 and
    approximately $9.0 million during the first quarter of
    2006. The remainder of this tax liability was offset by the tax
    benefit of carryforwards.

The Company’s effective tax rates for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 17.1%, 15.5% and
    26.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for
    2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to the
    proportionate increase in net income in jurisdictions with
    comparatively high effective tax rates. Included in the 2007 tax
    provision is a tax benefit of $4.4 million associated with
    the charge related to the transitional contribution into the
    Waters Employee Investment Plan (Note 16). The 2007 and
    2006 tax rates also include tax benefits related to
    SFAS No. 123(R). Included in the 2005 effective tax
    rate is $24.0 million of income tax expense related to the
    repatriation of funds from the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries under the AJCA.


Patent
    Litigation

The Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in
    the ordinary course of business. The Company believes the
    outcome, if the plaintiff ultimately prevails, will not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial position.

The Company has been engaged in ongoing patent litigation with
    Agilent Technologies, Inc. in England, France and Germany. The
    Company recorded a provision of $7.8 million in the first
    quarter of 2004 for estimated damages and fees to be incurred
    with respect to the England and France suits. The Company
    recorded a provision of $3.1 million during 2005 for
    estimated damages and fees to be incurred with respect to the
    England suit, which was settled in February 2006. No additional
    provisions were made in 2006 or 2007. No provision has been made
    for the Germany suit and the Company believes the outcome, if
    the plaintiff ultimately prevails, will not have a material

impact on the Company’s financial position. The accrued
    patent litigation expense in other current liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2007 and 2006
    is $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, for
    the France suit. The change in the liability in 2007 is
    attributable to payment of legal fees.


Restructuring
    and Other Charges

In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan,
    primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe,
    which resulted in the employment of 74 employees being
    terminated, all of which had left the Company as of
    December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company closed a sales
    and demonstration office in the Netherlands in the second
    quarter of 2006. The Company implemented this cost reduction
    plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business
    opportunities around the world. The Company incurred
    $8.5 million of charges in 2006 related to the February
    2006 initiative. The Company does not expect to incur any
    additional charges in connection with this cost reduction
    initiative.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in
    its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements,
    the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse

    partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or
    other intellectual property infringement claims by any third
    party with respect to its current products, as well as claims
    relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from
    the performance of services by the Company or its
    subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments
    the Company could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the

Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
    relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and
    management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of
    these agreements is immaterial.


Stock-Based
    Compensation

In May 2003, the Company’s shareholders approved the
    Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (“2003
    Plan”). As of December 31, 2007, the 2003 Plan has
    4.7 million shares available for granting in the form of
    incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
    rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock
    units or other types of awards. The Company issues new shares of
    common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock
    unit conversion. Under the 2003 Plan, the exercise price for
    stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the
    underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2003 Plan is
    scheduled to terminate on March 4, 2013. Options generally
    will expire no later than 10 years after the date on which
    they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally
    vest in equal annual installments over a five year period. A SAR
    may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other
    award. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units may
    be issued under the 2003 Plan for such consideration as is
    determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. No award of restricted stock may have a restriction
    period of less than three years except as may be recommended by
    the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or with
    respect to any award of restricted stock which provides solely
    for a performance-based risk of forfeiture so long as such award
    has a restriction period of at least one year. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had stock options,
    restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards outstanding.

In February 1996, the Company adopted its 1996 Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan under which eligible employees may contribute up
    to 15% of their earnings toward the quarterly purchase of the
    Company’s common stock. The plan makes available
    1.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock
    commencing October 1, 1996. As of December 31, 2007,
    0.8 million shares have been issued under the plan. Each
    plan period lasts three months beginning on January 1,
    April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. The purchase
    price for each share of stock is the lesser of 90% of the market
    price on the first day of the plan period or 100% of the market
    price on the last day of the plan period. Stock-based
    compensation expense related to this plan was $0.4 million
    for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment”,
    which amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation”, and SAB 107,
    “Share-Based Payment”. These standards require that
    all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the
    statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company
    has used the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of
    its stock option awards at the time of grant.

The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method
    permitted under SFAS No. 123(R) and, consequently, has
    not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified
    prospective transition method, compensation costs associated
    with awards for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006
    now include the expense relating to the remaining unvested
    awards granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense
    related to any awards issued subsequent to December 31,
    2005. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line
    attribution method. The amount of stock-based compensation
    recognized during the period is based on the value of the
    portion of the award that ultimately is expected to vest.

The consolidated statements of operations for the three years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 include the
    following stock-based compensation expense related to stock
    option awards, restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards
    and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands):

The after-tax stock-based compensation and the impact to diluted
    earnings per share of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) for the
    years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were
    $20.0 million with a $0.19 per share reduction to diluted
    earnings per share and $20.6 million with a $0.20 per share
    reduction to diluted earnings per share, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company has capitalized stock-based
    compensation costs of $0.4 million and $1.6 million to
    inventory and capitalized software, respectively, in the
    consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company has capitalized stock-based compensation costs of
    $0.6 million and $1.0 million to inventory and capitalized
    software, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets.
    Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company
    used the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by APB
    No. 25 and related interpretations, including FASB
    Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 44, “Accounting
    for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation”, for
    its plans. Under this accounting method, stock option
    compensation awards that are granted with the exercise price at
    the current fair value of the Company’s common stock as of
    the date of the award generally did not require compensation
    expense to be recognized in the consolidated statements of
    operations. Stock-based compensation expense recognized for the
    Company’s fixed employee stock option plans, restricted
    stock and employee stock purchase plan was $0.8 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), benefits of
    tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were
    reported as part of cash from operating activities. Under
    SFAS No. 123(R), approximately $17.0 million and
    $16.5 million of windfall benefits of tax deductions in
    excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as cash
    from financing activities for the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

During 2007 and 2006, the total intrinsic value of the stock
    options exercised (i.e., the difference between the market price
    at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the
    options) was $97.5 million and $40.1 million,
    respectively. The total cash received from the exercise of these
    stock options was $88.5 million and $37.3 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were
    $51.2 million and $61.1 million of total unrecognized
    compensation costs related to unvested stock option awards.
    These costs are expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 3.1 years.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
    earnings per share had the Company applied the fair-value
    recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 for the
    Company’s stock-based compensation plans for the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In
    determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company
    makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including
    volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option
    lives. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
    consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that
    ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of
    expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
    Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If
    actual results



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based
    compensation expense and the Company’s results of
    operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the
    Company employs different assumptions in the application of
    SFAS No. 123(R), the compensation expense that the
    Company records in the future periods may differ significantly
    from what the Company has recorded in the current period.

The expected volatility assumption of all grants issued prior to
    2005 was derived from the Company’s historical volatility.
    Beginning in 2005, the Company uses implied volatility on its
    publicly traded options as the basis for its estimate of
    expected volatility. The Company believes that implied
    volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected
    volatility because it is generally reflective of historical
    volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ
    from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for
    grants is based on historical experience for the population of
    non-qualified stock optionees. The risk-free interest rate is
    the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
    issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term
    used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data
    used to determine the value of the stock options granted in
    2007, 2006 and 2005 are as follows:

respectively. The weighted-average exercise prices of options
    exercisable at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    $40.77, $37.43 and $34.34, respectively. The weighted-average
    remaining contractual life of the exercisable outstanding stock
    options at December 31, 2007 was 4.8 years.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had 7.0 million
    stock options which are vested and expected to vest. The
    intrinsic value, weighted-average price and remaining
    contractual life of the vested and expected to vest stock
    options were $246.0 million, $43.74 and 5.8 years,
    respectively, at December 31, 2007.

In 2005, the Company approved an amendment to accelerate the
    vesting of approximately 12 thousand unvested stock options and
    to extend the expiration date of approximately 36 thousand stock
    options granted to a retiring non-employee director of the
    Company. The Company also approved an amendment to accelerate
    the vesting of two thousand shares of the Company’s
    restricted common stock granted to the same director. Under APB
    No. 25 and FIN No. 44, these modifications
    resulted in a charge which was recorded in selling and
    administrative expense in the 2005 consolidated statements of
    operations of approximately $0.5 million.

Restricted
    Stock

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    the Company granted eight thousand, eight thousand and seven
    thousand shares of restricted stock, respectively. The
    restrictions on these shares lapse at the end of a three year
    period. The Company has recorded $0.3 million,
    $0.2 million and $0.2 million of compensation expense
    during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the
    restricted stock grants. The weighted-average fair value on the
    grant date of the restricted stock for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $48.88, $39.64 and $45.77, respectively. As of December 31,
    2007, the Company has 22 thousand unvested shares of restricted
    stock outstanding with a total of $0.4 million of
    unrecognized compensation costs. These costs are expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Retirement
    Plans

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution plan,
    after one month of service. Employees may contribute from 1% to
    30% of eligible pay on a pre-tax basis. Prior to the amendments
    described below, which become effective on January 1, 2008,
    the Company made matching contributions of 50% for contributions
    up to 6% of eligible pay after one year of service. Employees
    are 100% vested in employee and Company matching contributions.
    For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company’s matching contributions amounted to
    $4.1 million, $3.6 million and $3.4 million,
    respectively.

U.S. employees were eligible to participate in the Waters
    Retirement Plan, a defined benefit, cash balance plan, after one
    year of service. Annually, the Company credited each
    employee’s account as a percentage of eligible pay based on
    years of service. In addition, each employee’s account is
    credited for investment returns at the beginning of each year
    for the prior year at the average 12 month Treasury Bill
    rate plus 0.5%, limited to a minimum rate of 5% and a maximum
    rate of 10%. An employee does not vest until the completion of
    five years of service, at which time the employee becomes 100%
    vested. The Company maintains an unfunded supplemental executive
    retirement plan, the Waters Retirement Restoration Plan, which
    is non-qualified and restores the benefits under the Waters
    Retirement Plan that are limited by IRS benefit and compensation
    maximums.

In September 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved various amendments to freeze the pay credit accrual
    under the Waters Retirement Plan and the Waters Retirement
    Restoration Plan (the “U.S. Pension Plans”)
    effective December 31, 2007. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 88, “Employers Accounting for
    Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans
    and for Termination Benefits”, the Company recorded a
    curtailment gain of $0.5 million. In addition, the Company
    re-measured the U.S. Pension Plans’ liabilities in
    September 2007 and the Company has reduced the projected benefit
    obligation liability by $6.7 million with a corresponding
    adjustment, net of tax, to accumulated other comprehensive
    income as a result of the curtailment reducing the accrual for
    future service.

The Company’s Board of Directors also approved a
    $12.6 million payment that will be contributed to the
    Waters Employee Investment Plan in the first quarter of 2008.
    The $12.6 million of expense was reduced by a



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

curtailment gain of $0.5 million, relating to various
    amendments to freeze the pay credit accrual, resulting in
    $12.2 million of expense being recorded in the consolidated
    statements of operations in the year ending December 31,
    2007 with $2.6 million included in cost of sales,
    $7.4 million included in selling and administrative
    expenses and $2.2 million included in research and
    development expenses. In addition, effective January 1,
    2008, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the
    employer matching contribution in the Waters Employee Investment
    Plan to 100% for contributions up to 6% of eligible pay, an
    increase of 3%, and eliminated the one-year service requirement
    to be eligible for matching contributions.

The Company also sponsors other unfunded employee benefit plans
    in the U.S., including a retirement healthcare plan which
    provides reimbursement for medical expenses and is contributory.
    There are various

non-U.S. retirement

plans sponsored by the Company. The eligibility and vesting of
    the

non-U.S. plans

are generally consistent with the local laws and regulations.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”, which
    amends SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Pensions”, SFAS No. 88,
    SFAS No. 106, “Employers Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions”, and
    SFAS No. 132(R). This standard requires an employer to
    recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans,
    previously disclosed in the footnotes to the financial
    statements, as an asset or liability in its statement of
    financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
    status in the year in which the changes occur through
    comprehensive income.

The net periodic pension cost under SFAS No. 87 is
    made up of several components that reflect different aspects of
    the Company’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of
    benefits earned by employees. These components are determined
    using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method and are
    based on certain actuarial assumptions. The Company’s
    accounting policy is to reflect in the projected benefit
    obligation all benefit changes to which the Company is committed
    as of the current valuation date; use a market-related value of
    assets to determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior
    service costs on a straight-line basis over the expected future
    service of active participants as of the date such costs are
    first recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and
    losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related
    value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation over
    the expected future service of active participants.

Summary data for the U.S. Pension Plans, the
    U.S. retirement healthcare plan and the Company’s

non-U.S. retirement

plans are presented in the following tables, using the
    measurement date of December 31, 2007 and 2006,

The asset allocation policy for the U.S. Pension Plans and
    U.S. retirement healthcare plan was developed in
    consideration of the following long-term investment objectives:
    achieving a return on assets consistent with the investment
    policy, maximizing portfolio returns with at least a return of
    2.5% above the one-year Treasury Bill rate and achieving
    portfolio returns which exceeds the average return for similarly
    invested funds.

Within the equity portfolio of the U.S. retirement plans,
    investments are diversified among market capitalization and
    investment strategy. Up to 20% of the U.S. retirement
    plans’ equity portfolio may be invested in financial
    markets outside of the United States. The Company does not
    invest in its own stock within the U.S. retirement
    plans’ assets.

The Company prohibits the following types of assets or
    transactions in the U.S. retirement plans: short selling,
    margin transactions, commodities and future contracts, private
    placements, options and letter stock.

The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit
    obligation in the consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are as follows:

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
    assumption, the Company considered the historical returns and
    the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as
    well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio and
    historical expenses paid by the plan. A one-quarter percentage
    point increase in the discount rate would decrease the
    Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters
    Retirement Plan by approximately $0.3 million. A
    one-quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long-term
    rate of return would decrease the Company’s net periodic
    benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by approximately
    $0.2 million.

During fiscal year 2008, the Company expects to contribute
    approximately $3.5 million to $7.0 million to the
    Company’s pension plans.

Business
    Segment Information

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information”, establishes standards
    for reporting information about operating segments in annual
    financial statements and requires selected information for those
    segments to be presented in interim financial reports of public
    business enterprises. It also establishes standards for related
    disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and
    major customers. The Company’s business activities, for
    which discrete financial information is available, are regularly
    reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision makers.
    As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it
    has two operating segments: Waters Division and TA Division.

Waters Division is in the business of designing, manufacturing,
    distributing and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and
    other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used
    along with other analytical instruments. TA Division is in the
    business of designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing
    thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The
    Company’s two divisions are its operating segments and each
    has similar economic characteristics; product processes;
    products and services; types and classes of customers; methods
    of distribution and regulatory environments. Because of these
    similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one
    reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer
    to the consolidated financial statements for financial
    information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company.

Net sales for the Company’s products and services are as
    follows for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and

The Company experiences an increase in sales in the fourth
    quarter, as a result of purchasing habits on capital goods of
    customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by
    calendar year end. Selling and administrative expenses are
    typically higher in the second and third quarters over the first
    quarter in each year as the Company’s annual payroll merit
    increases take effect. Selling and administrative expenses will
    vary in the fourth quarter in relation to performance in the
    quarter and for the year. In the third quarter of 2007, the
    Company recorded a $12.2 million charge relating to the
    pension transition benefit that will be contributed into the
    Waters Employee Investment Plan in the first quarter of 2008.


Quarterly
    Financial Data (unaudited)

The Company classified certain marketable securities as cash and
    cash equivalents on each of the fiscal 2007 quarterly unaudited

    the Board of Directors of the Company concluded that a

    consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows as of

    flows from investing activities on the unaudited consolidated

    in classification has no effect on previously reported current
    assets, total assets, stockholders’ equity, cash flows from
    operating activities or cash flows from financing activities.
