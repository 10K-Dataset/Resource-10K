PART I

Item 1:

Business

General

Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,”
“our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical
workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high
performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC

TM

” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products
and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together

(“LC-MS”)

and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software
platforms. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA

TM

product line. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the
Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments.

The Company’s products are used by
pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers working in research and development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a
broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in
drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing.

LC-MS

instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. The Company’s thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the
suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research.

Waters Corporation, organized as a Delaware corporation in 1991, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of
Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating subsidiary. Waters Corporation became a publicly-traded company with its initial public offering (“IPO”) in November 1995. Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and
complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited in September 1997.

Business Segments

The Company’s business activities, for which
discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters

TM

and TA

TM

. The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and
MS instrument systems, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and
servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution;
and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes.

Information concerning revenues and long-lived assets attributable to each of the Company’s products, services and geographic areas is set forth in Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.



Waters Products and Markets

High Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography

HPLC is a standard
technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes that HPLC’s performance capabilities enable it to separate, identify and quantify a high proportion of all
known chemicals. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes, quality control and process engineering applications.

The most significant

end-use

markets for HPLC are those served by the pharmaceutical and life
science industries. In these markets, HPLC is used extensively to understand diseases, identify new drugs, develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other applications,
such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations and the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as chemical
and consumer products. HPLC is also used by universities, research institutions and governmental agencies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”) and their foreign counterparts that mandate safety and efficacy testing.

In 2004,
Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY UPLC

TM

, to accommodate the increased pressure and narrower chromatographic
bands that are generated by these small and tightly packed particles. By using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses
previously performed by HPLC. In addition, in using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information. While offering significant
performance advantages, the ACQUITY UPLC is also compatible with the Company’s software products and the general operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the Company’s customers and field sales and support organizations are well
positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument. In 2018, the Company introduced the ACQUITY

TM

ARC

TM

Bio
System, a versatile, iron-free,

bio-inert,

quaternary liquid chromatograph specifically engineered to improve bioseparation analytical methods. The Company also introduced the ACQUITY

TM

UPLC

TM

PLUS series in 2018, consisting of the

H-Class

PLUS,

H-Class

PLUS Bio and

I-Class

PLUS systems, which incorporate foundational enhancements into the legacy systems.

Waters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation, from component
configured systems for academic teaching and research applications to fully automated systems for regulated and high sample throughput testing, and that have a variety of detection technologies, from optical-based ultra-violet (“UV”)
absorbance, refractive index and fluorescence detectors to a suite of

MS-based

detectors, optimized for certain analyses.

The primary consumable products for LC are chromatography columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in the LC testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals. The
chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from silica or polymeric resins. As a pressurized sample is introduced to the column inlet and permeates through the packed column, it
is separated into its constituent components.

Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and competitors’ LC
systems. The Company believes that it is one of a few suppliers in the world that processes silica and polymeric resins, packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a
key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and can react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company believes that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used primarily on its



ACQUITY UPLC instrument systems and, furthermore, that its ACQUITY UPLC instruments primarily use ACQUITY UPLC columns. In 2016, the Company continued to expand its column chemistry capabilities
through the introduction of CORTECS

TM

C


, CORTECS

TM

Phenyl, CORTECS

TM

T3 and CORTECS

TM

Shield RP18. In 2018, the Company introduced the BioResolve

TM

RP mAb Polyphenyl columns, which improve the consistency and reliability of the overly complex separations of
monoclonal antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates.

The Company’s precision chemistry consumable
products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products, including Certified Reference Materials (“CRM”s) and Proficiency Testing (“PT”) products. Laboratories around the world and across multiple industries
use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical
analysis. In 2018, the Company introduced the VICAM

TM

BPATest

TM

, which provides a sensitive, precise
determination of Bisphenol A in as little as ten minutes. VICAM also introduced a user-friendly lateral flow zearalenone strip test, the

Zearala-V

AQUA

TM

in 2018.

Mass Spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry

MS is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses
of molecules that have been converted into ions.

The Company is a technology and market leader in the development,
manufacture, sale and service of MS instruments and components. These instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems, such as LC, chemical electrophoresis and gas chromatography. A
wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of MS instrumentation, including devices that incorporate quadrupole, ion trap,

time-of-flight

(“Tof”), magnetic sector and ion mobility technologies. Furthermore, these technologies are often used in tandem

(MS-MS)

to maximize the speed and/or efficacy of certain experiments.

Currently, the Company offers a wide range of MS instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof and ion mobility
designs. These instrument systems are used in drug discovery and development, as well as for environmental, clinical and nutritional safety testing. The overwhelming majority of mass spectrometers sold by the Company are designed to utilize an LC
system and a liquid compatible interface (such as an electrospray ionization source) as the sample introduction device. These products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the pharmaceutical, biomedical, clinical, food and beverage and
environmental market segments worldwide.

MS is an increasingly important detection technology for LC.
The Company’s

smaller-sized

mass spectrometers, such as the single quadrupole detector (“SQD”) and the tandem quadrupole detector (“TQD”), are often referred to as LC
“detectors” and are typically sold as part of an LC system or as an LC system upgrade. Larger quadrupole systems, such as the Xevo

TM

TQ and Xevo

TM

TQ-S

instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for late-stage
drug development, including clinical trial testing. Quadrupole

time-of-flight

(“Q-Tof

TM

”) instruments, such as the Company’s SYNAPT

TM

G2-S,

are often used to
analyze the role of proteins in disease processes, an application sometimes referred to as “proteomics”. In 2016, the Company introduced the Xevo

TM

TQ-XS

mass spectrometry system enabled by the newly designed StepWave

TM

SX ion guide, which features a unique combination of ion optics,
detection and ionization technologies resulting in levels of sensitivity not previously seen. The Company also introduced SONAR in 2016, which is a new data acquisition technology for use with the Xevo

G2-XS

that allows for the quantification and identification of lipids, metabolites and proteins in complex samples in a more efficient manner. In 2018, the Company introduced the DART

QDa

TM

system with LiveID

TM

, a direct-from-sample analytical system that verifies sample authenticity or adulteration, specifically for food
applications. The Company also introduced the Xevo

TM

TQ-GC

mass spectrometer in 2018, which allows laboratories to meet and exceed low

part-per-billion

limits of detection when



quantifying pesticide residues and other contaminants in food using

GC-MS/MS

methods set forth by worldwide regulatory agencies/authorities. In addition,
the Company introduced the RenataDX

TM

screening system, a
flow-injection tandem mass spectrometry system for rapid high-throughput analysis of extracted dried blood spots and other human biological matrices.

LC and MS are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device. An increasing percentage of the Company’s
customers are purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it has become common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user. The descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical
segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly in today’s instrument market, this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of
instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS technologies as part of a single device. In response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters operating
segment to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated

LC-MS

systems.

Based
upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly-disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company believes that it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of LC and

LC-MS

instrument systems, chromatography columns and other consumables and related services.

The Company has been a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other suppliers’ instruments. The Company’s newest
software technology, UNIFI

TM

, is a scientific information
system that is the culmination of a multi-year effort to substantially bring all of Waters’ preexisting, distinct software systems under one operating system. UNIFI joins Waters’ suite of informatics products – Empower

TM

Chromatography Data Software, MassLynx

TM

Mass Spectrometry Software and NuGenesis

TM

Scientific Data Management System, each of which is used to support
innovations within world-leading institutions. UNIFI is the industry’s first comprehensive software that seamlessly integrates UPLC chromatography, mass spectrometry and informatics data workflows. In 2016, the Company announced two reference
libraries available within UNIFI, the Metabolic Profiling CCS Library and the

Rapi

Fluor-MS

TM

Glycan GU Scientific Library. The Company also introduced Symphony Data Pipeline software in 2016, which is a
client-server application that automates the movement and transformation of large amounts of

LC-MS

data to speed up analytical workflows and liberate scientists from mundane yet necessary tasks associated with
managing data files. In 2018, the Company announced new analysis capabilities across a variety of molecules by integrating UNIFI acquired data from the Company’s

Vion

TM

IMS QTof

TM

or Xevo

GS XS mass spectrometers with Molecular Discovery’s Mass-MetaSite and WebMetabase processing software.

Waters Service

Services provided
by Waters enable customers to maximize technology productivity, support customer compliance activities and provide transparency into enterprise resource management efficiencies. The customer benefits from improved budget control, data-driven
technology adoption and accelerated workflow at a site or on a global perspective. The Company considers its service offerings to be highly differentiated from our competition, as evidenced by a consistent increase in annual service revenues. The
Company’s principal competitors in the service market include PerkinElmer, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and General Electric Company. These competitors can provide certain services on Waters instruments to
varying degrees and always present competitive risk.

The servicing and support of instruments, software and accessories is an
important source of revenue and represents over 30% of sales for Waters. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans, demand services, spare parts, customer performance validation services and customer training. Support
plans typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to promptly repair a

non-functioning

instrument in return for a fee described in a contract that is priced according to the
configuration of the instrument.



TA Products and Markets

Thermal Analysis, Rheometry and Calorimetry

Thermal analysis measures the physical
or thermodynamic characteristics of materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials, such as their heat flow characteristics, physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical
properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal analysis techniques, including calorimetry. Consequently, thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development, production and characterization of materials in various industries,
such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and electronics.

Rheometry instruments often complement thermal
analyzers in characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity and deformation under different types of “loading” or other conditions. The information obtained under
such conditions provides insight into a material’s behavior during processing, packaging, transport, usage and storage.

Thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are heavily used in material testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide
information useful in predicting the suitability and stability of industrial polymers, fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science
research. As with systems offered by Waters, a range of instrument configurations is available with increasing levels of sample handling and information processing automation. In addition, systems and accompanying software packages can be tailored
for specific applications

In 2016, TA introduced a new line of differential scanning calorimeters and
thermogravimetric analyzers. These new Discovery DSC systems feature enhanced sensing technologies resulting in unprecedented performance in baseline flatness, sensitivity, resolution and reproducibility. In addition, TA introduced the

ACS-2

Air Chiller System, ElectroForce 3310 test instrument and DuraPulse

TM

Stent Graft test instrument in 2016.

In 2017, TA
introduced the TAM Air microcalorimeter. Although designed to characterize the curing of cement, this instrument is an ideal platform for imaginative experimental design in a wide range of applications, including cement and concrete, material
science, food, pharmaceuticals and environmental analysis. TA also introduced three new dilatometer product lines in its 800 platform, which are high precision systems designed to measure dimensional changes of a specimen brought about by dynamic
thermal events in a wide range of applications, including material science, ceramics and metals. In 2017, TA introduced the Discovery SDT 650, which provides a true simultaneous measurement of weight change and differential heat flow using advanced
technologies, such as dual sample TGA, modulated DSC and modulated and

hi-resolution

TGA. In addition, TA introduced the Discovery

HP-TGA750,

a benchtop high pressure
TGA that utilizes a patented ultra-high resolution magnetic suspension balance and new high precision temperature control system. Late in 2017, TA introduced the Discovery DMA 850, which measures the viscoelastic mechanical properties of material
under controlled conditions of temperature, environment and mechanical stimulus (stress or strain). The DMA 850 features frictionless air bearing supports and a linear optical encoder, which ensures stable, accurate, high-resolution displacement
measurement across the full travel range and enables displacement control of 5 nm. In 2017, TA introduced the WinTestTM 8.0 software package, which will be standard on all new ElectroForce

TM

products. In addition, TA introduced the ElectroForce DMA 3200 in 2017, which combines fatigue and dynamic mechanical
analysis into a single mechanical test platform.

In September 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of
Rubotherm GmbH (“Rubotherm”), a manufacturer of gravimetric analysis systems, for approximately $6 million in cash, $5 million of which was paid at closing and an additional $1 million paid after closing to settle certain
liabilities. Rubotherm develops and manufactures analytical test instruments for thermogravimetric and sorption measurements that are used in both industrial and academic research laboratories in disciplines that include chemistry, material science
and engineering. The Rubotherm acquisition has helped support and further expand product offerings within TA’s thermal analysis business.



TA Service

Similar to Waters, the servicing and support of TA’s instruments is an important source of revenue and represents more than 25% of sales for TA. TA operates independently from the Waters operating
segment, though many of its overseas offices are situated in Waters’ facilities to achieve operational efficiencies. TA has dedicated field sales and service operations. Service sales are primarily derived from the sale of support plans,
replacement parts and billed labor fees associated with the repair, maintenance and upgrade of installed systems.

Global Customers

The Company typically has a broad and diversified customer base that includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts,
universities and governmental agencies. Purchase of the Company’s instrument systems is often dependent on its customers’ capital spending, or funding as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions, which often
fluctuate from year to year. The pharmaceutical segment represents the Company’s largest sector and includes multinational pharmaceutical companies, generic drug manufacturers, contract research organizations (“CRO”s) and
biotechnology companies. The Company’s other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers, polymer manufacturers, food and beverage companies and environmental testing laboratories. The Company also sells to universities and governmental
agencies worldwide. The Company’s technical sales and support staff members work closely with its customers in developing and implementing applications that meet their full range of analytical requirements. During 2018, 56% of the
Company’s net sales were to pharmaceutical accounts, 31% to other industrial accounts and 13% to governmental agencies and academic institutions.

The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of many customers who tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar
year end. The Company does not rely on any single customer for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of the Company’s net sales.

Sales and Service

The Company has one
of the largest direct sales and service organizations focused exclusively on the analytical workflows offered by the Company. Across these product technologies, using respective specialized sales and service workforces, the Company serves its
customer base with 87 sales offices throughout the world as of December 31, 2018 and approximately 3,900, 3,800 and 3,600 field representatives in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This investment in sales and service personnel serves to
maintain and expand the Company’s installed base of instruments. The Company’s sales representatives have direct responsibility for account relationships, while service representatives work in the field to install instruments, train
customers and minimize instrument downtime.

In-house

and field-based technical support representatives work directly with customers, providing them assistance with applications and procedures on Company
products. The Company provides customers with comprehensive information through various corporate and regional internet websites and product literature, and also makes consumable products available through electronic ordering facilities and a
dedicated catalog.

lines at its facility in Golden, Colorado, which is certified to ISO 9001:2015 and accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2017, ISO/IEC 17034:16 and ISO Guide 34. Some ERA products are also manufactured in the Wexford, Ireland facility, which is also
accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2005, ISO/IEC 17034:2016.

The Company manufactures and distributes its MS products at its
facilities in Wilmslow, England and Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the Company’s MS instruments are manufactured at its facility in Solihull, England and by long-standing outside contractors. Each stage of this supply chain
is closely monitored by the Company to maintain high quality and performance standards. The instruments, components or modules are then returned to the Company’s facilities, where its engineers perform final assembly, calibrations to customer
specifications and quality control procedures. The Company’s MS facilities are certified to ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 13485:2016/EN ISO 13485:2016 and adhere to applicable regulatory requirements (including the FDA Quality System Regulation and the
European

In-Vitro

Diagnostic Directive).

TA’s thermal analysis, rheometry and
calorimetry products are manufactured and distributed at the Company’s New Castle, Delaware, Wakefield, Massachusetts, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, Lindon, Utah and Huellhorst, Germany facilities. Similar to MS, elements of TA’s products are
manufactured by outside contractors and are then returned to the Company’s facilities for final assembly, calibration and quality control. The Company’s New Castle facility is certified to ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 17025:2005 standards and the
Eden Prairie facility is certified to both ISO 9001:2015 and ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standards.

Raw Materials

The Company purchases a variety of raw materials, primarily consisting of high temperature alloy sheet metal and castings, forgings,

pre-plated

metals and electrical components from various vendors. The materials used by the Company’s operations are generally available from a number of sources and in sufficient quantities to meet current
requirements subject to normal lead times.



The Company is subject to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which may be contained in the Company’s
products, are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. In 2017, the Company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products. However, the
Company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The Company is in the process of evaluating its 2018 supply chain, and the Company plans to file its 2018
Form SD with the SEC in May 2019. The results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the Company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products.

In addition, the Company continues to monitor environmental health and safety regulations in countries in which it operates
throughout the world, in particular, European Union and China Restrictions on the use of certain Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS) and European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. Further
information regarding these regulations is available on the Company’s website,

Research and Development

The Company maintains an active research and development program
focused on the development and commercialization of products that extend, complement and update its existing product offering. The Company’s research and development expenditures for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $143 million, $133 million
and $125 million, respectively. In addition, in 2017, the Company incurred a $5 million charge for acquired

in-process

research and development related to milestone payments associated with a
licensing arrangement for certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and for which there was no future alternative use as of the acquisition date. This licensing arrangement is significantly
related to new, biologically-focused applications, as well as other applications, and require the Company to make additional future payments of up to $7 million if certain milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on future net sales.

Nearly all of the Company’s LC products have been developed at the Company’s main research and development center
located in Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the Company’s extensive field organizations and customers. The majority of the Company’s MS products are developed at facilities in England and most of the Company’s
current materials characterization products are developed at the Company’s research and development center in New Castle, Delaware. At December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were 1,011, 1,004 and 971 employees, respectively, involved in
the Company’s research and development efforts. The Company has increased research and development expenses from its continued commitment to invest significantly in new product development and existing product enhancements, and as a result of
acquisitions. Despite the Company’s active research and development programs, there can be no assurance that the Company’s product development and commercialization efforts will be successful or that the products developed by the Company
will be accepted by the marketplace.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 7,200 employees at both December 31, 2018 and 2017 and 6,900 at December 31, 2016, with approximately 39% of the Company’s employees located in the United
States. The Company believes its employee relations are generally good. The Company’s employees are not unionized or affiliated with any internal or external labor organizations. The Company firmly believes that its future success largely
depends upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees.

Competition

The analytical instrument systems, supplies and services market is highly competitive. The Company encounters competition from several worldwide suppliers
and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets for



each of its three primary technologies. The Company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of product performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser extent, price. Competitors
continuously introduce new products and have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company’s business. Some competitors have greater financial resources and broader distribution than the Company’s.

In the markets served by Waters, the Company’s principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation,
Bruker Corporation, Danaher Corporation and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. In the markets served by TA, the Company’s principal competitors include: PerkinElmer, Inc., Mettler-Toledo International Inc., NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH, Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., Malvern PANalytical Ltd., a subsidiary of Spectris plc and Anton-Paar GmbH.

The market for consumable LC
products, including separation columns, is highly competitive and generally more fragmented than the analytical instruments market. The Company encounters competition in the consumable columns market from chemical companies that produce column
sorbents and small specialized companies that primarily pack purchased sorbents into columns and subsequently package and distribute columns. The Company believes that it is one of the few suppliers that processes silica and polymeric resins, packs
columns and distributes its own products. The Company competes in this market on the basis of performance, reproducibility, reputation and, to a lesser extent, price. In recent years, the Company’s principal competitors for consumable products
have included: Danaher Corporation; Merck KGaA; Agilent Technologies, Inc.; General Electric Company and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to offer a predictable level of performance when used with ACQUITY UPLC
columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the ACQUITY UPLC instrument base will enhance its chromatographic column business because of the high level of synergy between ACQUITY UPLC columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instruments.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

The
Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents and has patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. Certain technology and software has been acquired or is licensed from third parties. The Company also owns a number
of trademarks. The Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is, in and of itself, essential to the
Company such that its loss would materially affect the Company’s business as a whole.

Environmental Matters and Climate Change

The Company is subject to foreign and U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or
operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages
resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations and has operated its business in the past in substantial compliance with applicable
environmental laws. From time to time, Company operations have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse
effect on its operations, financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws.

The Company is sensitive to the growing global debate with respect to climate change. An internal sustainability working group develops increasingly robust data with respect to the Company’s
utilization of carbon producing substances in an effort to continuously reduce the Company’s carbon footprint. In 2018, the Company published a sustainability report identifying the various actions and behaviors the Company has adopted from
2014 to 2017 concerning its commitment to both the environment and the broader topic of social responsibility. See Item 1A, Risk Factors –

10-K

and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking
statements.

Item 1A:

Risk

Factors

The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:

The Company’s international operations may be negatively affected by political events, wars or terrorism and regulatory changes, related to
either a specific country or a larger region. These potential political, currency and economic disruptions, as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or
financial condition.

Approximately 72% and 71% of the Company’s net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively, were outside of the United
States and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company has considerable manufacturing operations in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as significant subcontractors located in Singapore. As a result, a significant
portion of the Company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks, including adverse developments in the political, regulatory and economic environment, in particular, uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic
trade policy; the effect of the U.K. voting to exit the European Union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of European countries; the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism; the instability and
possible dissolution of the Euro as a single currency; sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices; tariffs and other trade barriers;
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and associated adverse operational, contractual and tax consequences.



Additionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net sales, cost of
sales, operating expenses, interest, taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies, particularly the Euro,
Japanese yen and British pound, could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

Global economic conditions may decrease demand for the Company’s products and harm the Company’s financial results.

The Company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions. These changes in global economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S., may affect the
demand for the Company’s products and services. This may result in a decline in sales in the future, increased rate of order cancellations or delays, increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories, longer sales cycles and potential difficulty
in collecting sales proceeds. There can be no assurance regarding demand for the Company’s products and services in the future.

The
Company’s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand, which may decrease for a number of reasons, many beyond the Company’s control.

The demand for the Company’s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its LC,

LC-MS,

thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry products; the
timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the Company’s customers; changes in governmental regulations, particularly affecting drug, food and drinking water testing; funding available to governmental, academic and research
institutions; general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the Company’s major markets; and competitive considerations. The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing
habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will effectively forecast customer demand and appropriately allocated research and
development expenditures to products with high growth and high margin prospects. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company’s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the
factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions.

Additionally, the analytical instrument
market may, from time to time, experience low sales growth. Approximately 56% of the Company’s net sales in both 2018 and 2017 were to worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market
conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

Disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the Company’s access to capital and financial condition.

Financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have experienced times of extreme disruption, including, among other things, sharp increases in the cost of new capital, credit rating downgrades and
bailouts, severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets. Financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions, resulting in large asset write-downs, higher costs of capital, rating
downgrades and reduced desire to lend money. There can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions. Any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial
markets or financial institutions in which the Company participates may impair the Company’s ability to access its existing cash, utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions, and impair its ability
to access sources of new capital. The cost to the Company of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur.



Competitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the Company’s, which
could result in decreased sales. The competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidations among the Company’s competitors, which could harm the Company’s business.

The analytical instrument market and, in particular, the portion related to the Company’s HPLC, UPLC,

LC-MS,

thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines, is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. The Company encounters competition from several international instrument
suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets. Some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company’s business, but are typically less focused on the Company’s chosen
markets. Over the years, some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons, including increasing product line offerings, improving market share and reducing costs. There can be no assurance that the Company’s competitors
will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the Company or that the Company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s sales and
marketing forces will compete successfully against the Company’s competitors in the future.

Strategies for organic growth require
developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial results.

The Company’s corporate strategy is fundamentally based on winning through organic innovation and deep application expertise. The Company is in the process of developing new products with recently
acquired technologies. The future development of these new products will require a significant amount of spending over the next few years before significant, robust sales will be realized. Furthermore, these new products will be sold into both the

non-clinical

and clinical markets, and any new products requiring FDA clearance may take longer to bring to market. There can be no assurance given as to the timing of these new product launches and the ultimate
realization of sales and profitability in the future.

The Company’s software or hardware may contain coding or manufacturing errors
that could impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences.

Despite testing prior to the
release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, the detection and correction of any errors in released software or hardware can be time consuming and costly. This could delay the development or release of new products or services, or
new versions of products or services, create security vulnerabilities in the Company’s products or services, and adversely affect market acceptance of products or services. If the Company experiences errors or delays in releasing its software
or hardware, or new versions thereof, its sales could be affected and revenues could decline. Errors in software or hardware could expose the Company to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as harm to brand and reputation,
which could impact future sales.

The loss of key members of management and the risks inherent in succession planning could adversely
affect the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The operation of the Company requires managerial and operational
expertise. None of the Company’s key management employees, with the exception of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, have an employment contract with the Company and there can be
no assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company. If, for any reason, other such key personnel do not continue to be active in management, the Company’s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Disruption of operations at the Company’s manufacturing facilities could harm the Company’s financial condition.

The Company manufactures LC instruments at facilities in Milford, Massachusetts and through a subcontractor in Singapore; precision chemistry separation
columns at its facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford,



Ireland; MS products at its facilities in Wilmslow, England, Solihull, England and Wexford, Ireland; thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in New Castle, Delaware and other
instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the Company’s acquisitions. Any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility
or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

Failure to
adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

There can be no assurance that any patents held by the Company will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company.
Additionally, there could be successful claims against the Company by third-party patent holders with respect to certain Company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties. The Company’s patents, including
those licensed from others, expire on various dates. If the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights, it could have an adverse and material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The Company’s business would suffer if the Company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply.

Most of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by the Company are available from a number of different suppliers; however, a number of items
are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have, at a minimum, a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the Company. A prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or
components could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely affect the Company’s business.

The Company’s sales would deteriorate if the Company’s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules.

Certain components or modules of the Company’s LC and MS instruments are manufactured by outside contractors, including the manufacturing of LC
instrument systems and related components by contract manufacturing firms in Singapore. Disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the Company. A prolonged
inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

The Company’s business could be harmed by actions of distributors and other third parties that sell our products.

The Company sells some products through third parties, including distributors and value-added resellers. This exposes us to various risks, including competitive pressure, concentration of sales volumes,
credit risks and compliance risks. We may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue or net earnings. Distributors may also face financial difficulties, including
bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable. Violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could
materially impact our business. Risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses and weaken our competitive position.

The Company may be harmed by improper conduct of any of our employees, agents or business partners.

We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect the Company from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate domestic and
international laws, including laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money



laundering and data privacy. In particular, the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to
government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our
reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and

non-monetary

penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our
suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.

The effects of climate change could harm the Company’s business.

The Company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws
governing the environment. In the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use and/or levels of possible
emissions from such chemicals and/or other substances, the Company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the
Company.

Another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions. The
Company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany. In addition, the Company manufactures a growing percentage of its HPLC, UPLC and MS products in both Singapore and Ireland. Severe weather
and geological conditions or events, including earthquakes, hurricanes and/or tsunamis, could potentially cause significant damage to the Company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries. The effects of such damage and the
resulting disruption of manufacturing operations and the impact of lost sales could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the Company.

The Company’s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in

pre-tax

income between tax jurisdictions, changing application of tax law and tax audit
examinations.

The Company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0% up to 35% in various jurisdictions in which it conducts
business. In addition, the Company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Geographical shifts in income from previous quarters’ projections caused by factors including, but not limited
to, changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates, could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the Company’s income tax expense, effective tax rate and results of
operations.

Governments in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from
time to time. Any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations, in the jurisdictions in which
the Company operates could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden, which would negatively affect the Company’s profitability.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the 2017 Tax Act. The 2017 Tax Act changed the U.S. tax system to a territorial tax system,
including base broadening measures on

non-U.S.

earnings, whereby historical unremitted, earnings of foreign subsidiaries are deemed to have been repatriated to the U.S. in 2017 regardless of when the assets
are actually remitted to the U.S., as well as reducing or eliminating certain domestic deductions and credits and limiting the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation. Earnings deemed to have been distributed to the U.S. in
accordance with the aforementioned 2017 Tax Act deemed distribution rules are subject to a transition tax, which is a

one-time,

mandatory deemed repatriation tax on the accumulated



foreign earnings that have not been previously taxed. To the extent those earnings are deemed to have been invested in cash and cash equivalents, they will be taxed at a rate of 15.5%; the
remainder of those earnings will be taxed at a rate of 8.0%. As a result, the Company’s historical unremitted foreign earnings were deemed repatriated in 2017 and the Company incurred a $550 million estimated tax provision, which primarily
consisted of an estimated transition tax, as well as estimated income tax provisions for state and withholding taxes and a provision associated with the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to the new U.S.
corporate income tax rate of 21%. The transition tax will be paid over an eight-year period, which started in 2018, and will not accrue interest. During 2018, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations with respect to the transition
tax and other new areas of the Tax Reform law that impact the 2018 tax provision. The Company anticipates additional proposed regulations, and the final versions of the currently proposed regulations could clarify or change the interpretation of the
new laws. As permitted by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, the Company completed its analysis and calculation of the 2017 Tax Act federal and state transition tax liability during 2018, which remained significantly unchanged.

The Company has a contractual tax rate in Singapore of 0% through March 2021, based upon the achievement and continued
satisfaction of certain operational and financial milestones, which the Company expects to continue to meet. Currently, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in Singapore of 0% and has not
recognized any uncertain tax position in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in Singapore. In the event that it appears that the milestone targets will not be met, the Company will no longer be entitled to a 0%
contractual tax rate benefit on income earned in Singapore dating back to the start date of the agreement (April 1, 2016), at which time all tax benefits previously recorded would be reversed and an income tax charge equal to the statutory tax of
17% on income earned during that period would be recorded.

As a global business, the Company is subject to tax audit
examinations in various jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company must manage the cost and disruption of responding to governmental audits, investigation and proceedings. In addition, the impact of the settlement of pending or future tax audit
examination could have an unfavorable effect on the Company’s income tax expense, effective tax rate and results of operations.

The
Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow.

The Company had $1,148 million in debt and $1,735 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company also had the ability
to borrow an additional $1,208 million from its existing, committed credit facility. All but a small portion of the Company’s debt was in the U.S. There is a substantial cash requirement in the U.S. to fund operations and capital
expenditures, service debt interest obligations, finance potential U.S. acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs.

The Company has conducted a

post-tax

reform evaluation of its capital allocation strategy and is currently planning to use its existing cash, cash equivalents and
investments, cash flow from operations and available debt capacity to repurchase up to $4 billion of the Company’s common stock over the next two years. As a result, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely impacted if the Company is unable to generate and maintain a sufficient level of cash flow to address these requirements through (1) cash from operations, (2) the Company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving
credit facility, (3) the ability to expand the Company’s borrowing capacity and (4) other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost.

Debt covenants, and the Company’s failure to comply with them, could negatively impact the Company’s capital and financial results.

The Company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the Company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could
otherwise benefit the Company. These debt covenants include restrictions on the Company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements, which may limit the Company’s ability to make dividend or other payments, secure other
indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or



transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the Company’s debt agreements. The
Company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and all other covenants is dependent on the Company’s future performance, which is subject to, but not limited to, prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including
factors that are beyond the Company’s control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.

Disruption, cyber attack or unforeseen problems with the security, maintenance or upgrade of the Company’s information and

web-based

systems could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial condition.

The Company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its software and banking partners, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell
products and services, fulfill contract obligations, ship products, collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business. The Company’s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption
from, but not limited to, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access to customer or employee data, unauthorized access to and funds transfers from Company bank accounts and
other attempts to harm the Company’s systems. Any prolonged disruption to the Company’s technology infrastructure, at any of its facilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial
condition.

If the Company’s security measures are compromised or fail to adequately protect its technology infrastructure, research
and development efforts or manufacturing operations, the Company’s products and services may be perceived as vulnerable or unreliable, the information the Company’s controls and processes may be subject to unauthorized access, acquisition
or modification, the Company’s brand and reputation could be damaged, the services that the Company provides to its customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using the Company’s products and services, all of which could reduce
the Company’s revenue and earnings, increase its expenses and expose the Company to legal claims and regulatory actions.

The Company
is in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing analytical instruments to life science, pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, and environmental, academic and governmental customers working in research and
development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications, and the Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based products that support instrument systems. Many of the Company’s customers are in highly regulated industries.
While the Company has invested time and resources implementing measures designed to protect the integrity and security of its technology infrastructure, research and development processes, manufacturing operations, products and services, and the
internal and external data managed by the Company, there is a risk these measures will be defeated or compromised or that they are otherwise insufficient to protect against existing or emerging threats. The Company also has acquired companies,
products, services and technologies over time and may face inherit risk when integrating these acquisitions into the Company. In addition, at times, the Company faces attempts by third parties to defeat its security measures or exploit
vulnerabilities in its systems. These risks will increase as the Company continues to grow and expand geographically, and its systems, products and services become increasingly digital and sensor- and

web-based.

The Company could suffer significant damage to its brand and reputation if
a security incident resulted in unauthorized access to, acquisition of, or modification to the Company’s technology infrastructure, research and development processes, manufacturing operations, its products and services as well as the internal
and external data managed by the Company. Such an incident could disrupt the Company’s operations and customers could lose confidence in the Company’s ability to deliver quality and reliable products or services. This could negatively
impact sales and could increase costs related to fixing and addressing these incidents and any vulnerabilities exposed by them, as well as to lawsuits, regulatory investigations, claims or legal liability including contractual liability, costs and
expenses owed to customers and business partners.



Compliance failures could harm the Company’s business.

The Company is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including, among others, health and safety,
import/export, privacy and data protection, FCPA and environmental laws and regulations. A portion of the Company’s operations are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations are complex and
govern an array of product activities, including design, development, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. Any failure by the Company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls, the
imposition of fines, restrictions on the Company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations.

Regulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations, and the European Union has enacted a broad data protection regulation with fines based
on a percentage of global revenues. Changes in laws or regulations associated with enhanced protection of certain sensitive types of personal information, such as information related to health, could greatly increase the cost of compliance and the
cost of providing the Company’s products or services. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to comply with laws and regulations on privacy, data security or consumer protection, or other policies, public perception, standards,
self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against the Company or levied by governmental entities or others, or could otherwise adversely affect the business
and harm the Company’s reputation.

Some of the Company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws
and regulations with respect to the manufacturing, handling, use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances. This requires the Company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations. If the Company
fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products, it could face civil and/or criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant.

Some of the Company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies, such as the International
Standards Organization. The Company must comply with these rules, as well as those of other agencies, such as the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of
certification and/or the imposition of fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations.

As a publicly-traded company, the Company is subject to the rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Company must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, which require the
Company to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s efforts to comply with such laws and regulations are time consuming and costly. While we continue to enhance our controls, we cannot be certain
that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Failure to comply with such regulations or having inadequate internal controls could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and
operations, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.

The Company is subject to the rules of the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, requiring disclosure
as to whether certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which may be contained in the Company’s products, are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. In 2017, the Company
was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products. However, the Company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of
the Congo or adjoining countries. The Company is in the process of evaluating its 2018 supply chain, and the Company plans to file its 2018 Form SD with the SEC in May 2019. The results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and
may introduce new risks related to the Company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products.



The Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by
changes to the Company’s retirement plans or retirement plan assets.

In December 2018, the Company settled a frozen U.S. defined
benefit pension plan by making

lump-sum

cash payments and purchasing annuity contracts for participants to permanently extinguish the pension plan’s obligations. This plan was the Company’s largest
defined benefit pension plan. The Company still sponsors various retirement plans, both inside and outside the U.S. Any changes in regulations made by governments in countries in which the Company sponsors retirement plans could adversely impact the
Company’s cash flows or results of operations. In connection with these retirement plans, the Company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets. For example, changes in long-term interest rates affect the
discount rate that is used to measure the Company’s retirement plan obligations and related expense. In addition, changes in the market value of investments held by the retirement plans could materially impact the funded status of the
retirement plans, and affect the related pension expense and level and timing of contributions required under applicable laws.

Estimates
and assumptions made in accounting for the Company’s results from operations are dependent on future results, which involve significant judgments and may be imprecise and may differ materially from actual results.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain
information used in preparation of our financial statements which is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted
methodologies. The Company believes that the accounting related to revenue recognition, product returns and allowances, bad debts, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, warranty and installation provisions, litigation,
retirement plan obligations, stock-based compensation, equity investments, business combinations and asset acquisitions, uncertain tax positions and contingencies involves significant judgments and estimates. Actual results for all estimates could
differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The provision for income taxes for 2017 includes a $550 million estimate for the impact of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, which was signed
into law on December 22, 2017. The $550 million income tax provision reduced net income per share by $6.82. The $550 million income tax provision primarily consists of an estimated transition tax, as well as estimated income tax provisions for state
and withholding taxes and a provision associated with the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to the new U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%.

The Company adopted new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation in 2017. The new accounting guidance requires the excess
tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation to be reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes, whereas they were previously recognized in equity. This aspect of the new
accounting guidance was required to be adopted on a prospective basis for the statement of operations and retroactive restatement is not permitted. In 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized an excess tax benefit, which decreased income tax expense by
$9 million and $20 million, respectively, and added $0.11 and $0.24, respectively, to net income per diluted share.

In
addition, in December 2018, the Company settled a pension plan obligation by making lump-sum cash payments and purchasing annuity contracts for participants to permanently extinguish the pension plan’s obligations. As a result, the Company
recorded a $46 million charge, which consisted of a $6 million cash contribution to the plan and a $40 million non-cash charge related to the reversal of unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
stockholders’ equity. The $46 million pre-tax charge reduced net income per diluted share by $0.39.



**

In 2015, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs and deferred income taxes, both
standards have been applied above retrospectively. Certain debt issuance costs have been reclassified from intangible assets and are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt. Current deferred tax assets and
liabilities have been reclassified as non-current deferred tax assets and liabilities.

***

In 2018, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which eliminates the deferral of tax effects on intra-entity transfers other than
inventory and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 with a $4 million charge to beginning retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company’s net sales increased 5% in 2018 as compared to 2017, and 7% in 2017
as compared to 2016. Foreign currency translation increased sales growth by 1% in both 2018 and 2017. Recent acquisitions did not have an impact on sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, sales growth or decline percentages are presented as compared
with the same period in the prior year.

Instrument system sales increased 2% and 6% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2018,
the increase in instrument system sales was primarily driven by an increase in demand for LC and TA’s instrument systems. During 2018, the demand for our

LC-MS

instrument systems was somewhat unfavorably
impacted by the timing of new product introductions, as many of the Company’s new products were not launched until the second half of 2018 or early in 2019. In 2017, the demand for instrument system sales was balanced across our

LC-MS

and TA instrument systems. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 8% and 7% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, as a result of a larger installed base of
customers and higher billing demand for service sales.

Geographically, the Company’s sales growth in both 2018 and 2017
was primarily driven by the 7% and 10% sales growth in Asia, respectively, with double-digit sales growth in China for both years. Europe’s sales grew 4% and 10% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and benefited from the effect of foreign currency
translation, which added 3% and 2% to sales growth, respectively. The Company’s 2018 sales were impacted by lower sales growth in India and Europe, resulting from lower customer demand for our instrument systems. Sales in the Americas grew 3%
in 2018 and were flat in 2017. The Americas’ sales growth in 2017 was negatively impacted by natural disasters in the U.S., Mexico and Puerto Rico, as well as weaker customer sentiment in the first half of 2017.

Sales to pharmaceutical customers grew 5% and 7% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. These increases were driven by the increasing need for
global access to prescription drugs and the testing of newer and more complex biologic drugs. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include materials characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, grew 2% and 4% in 2018 and
2017, respectively. The growth in both 2018 and 2017 was driven by recent product introductions and rising global regulatory standards in both food and materials markets. Combined sales to governmental and academic customers increased 8% in both
2018 and 2017. Sales to governmental and academic customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales growth rates can vary significantly from period to period.

Operating income was $740 million in 2018, an increase of 12% as compared to 2017. This increase was primarily a result of the
effect of higher sales volume achieved in 2018, as well as the effect of approximately $33 million of facility closure, litigation and intellectual property payment charges from 2017 that did not recur in 2018.

Operating income increased 6% in 2017 as compared to 2016. This increase was primarily a result of the effect of higher sales volume
achieved in 2017, which was somewhat offset by the impact of $13 million of severance costs primarily associated with the closure of a facility in Germany and costs associated with providing U.S. employees with an early retirement transition
incentive; an $11 million litigation settlement provision and related costs and a $5 million charge relating to a milestone payment for the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be
commercialized. The change in operating income in 2017 as compared with 2016 was also impacted by $4 million of expense in 2017 related to the acceleration of certain stock awards as compared to $7 million of similar expense in 2016.

The Company’s effective tax rates were 13.0%, 96.8% and 13.1% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net income per
diluted share was $7.65, $0.25 and $6.41 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company’s effective tax and net income per diluted share were impacted by the following items:

•

In December 2018, the Company settled a pension plan obligation by making

lump-sum

cash payments and purchasing
annuity contracts for participants to permanently extinguish the pension plan’s



obligations. As a result, the Company recorded a $46 million charge, which consisted of a $6 million cash contribution to the plan and a $40 million

non-cash

charge related to the reversal of unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity. The $46 million

pre-tax

charge reduced net income per diluted share by $0.39.

•

The significant increase in the provision for income taxes for 2017 was a result of the $550 million estimate for the impact of the enactment of
the legislation informally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). The 2017 Tax Act changed the U.S. tax system to a territorial system, including broadening measures requiring the taxation of the Company’s
historical unremitted foreign earnings through a deemed repatriation. This provision reduced net income per diluted share by $6.82 in 2017, and the Company’s effective tax rate was 11.0% excluding this $550 million provision. As permitted
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, the Company completed its analysis and calculation of the 2017 Tax Act federal and state transition tax liability during 2018, which remained
significantly unchanged.

The Company generated $604 million, $698 million and $643 million
of net cash flows from operations in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2018 was primarily a result of $103 million of income tax payments made in the U.S. relating to the Company’s estimated 2017
transition tax liability and 2018 estimated tax payments, a $15 million litigation settlement payment and $11 million of contributions to certain defined benefit pension plans. Over the next four years, the Company is required to make
annual U.S. federal tax payments of approximately $38 million to tax authorities in connection with the Company’s estimated transition tax liabilities of $433 million under the 2017 Tax Act. The remaining 60% of the total liability is
required to be paid over a three-year period beginning in 2023. The increase in operating cash flow in 2017 was primarily a result of the increase in sales and operating income.

Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization
of $96 million, $85 million and $95 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations in the U.S. The
Company anticipates spending an estimated $215 million to build and equip this new

state-of-the-art

manufacturing facility,
which will be paid for with existing cash, investments and available debt capacity. The Company has spent $11 million on this facility through the end of 2018.

During the past three years, the Company has acquired technology to expand its future sales. In July 2018, the Company acquired the sole intellectual property rights to the Desorption Electrospray
Ionization (“DESI”) imaging technology for $30 million in cash and a future contractual obligation to pay a minimum royalty of $3 million over the remaining life of the patent. DESI is a mass spectrometry imaging technique that
is used to develop medical therapies. During 2018, the Company made $8 million of investments in unaffiliated companies. In 2017, the Company made a $7 million payment for an investment in a developer of analytical system solutions used to
make measurements, predict stability and accelerate product discovery in the routine analytic, process monitoring and quality control release processes for life science and biopharmaceutical markets. In addition, the Company made a milestone payment
of $5 million in 2017 to acquire and license intellectual property. In September 2016, the Company acquired Rubotherm GmbH for approximately $6 million in cash.

During 2018, the Company had net proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments of $1.8 billion. Most of these proceeds were repatriated into the U.S. in 2018, and were taxed at lower income
tax rates as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, and used to reduce the Company’s debt by $850 million and fund $1,315 million of share repurchases.

The Company has conducted a

post-tax

reform evaluation of its capital allocation strategy and the Company is currently planning to use its existing cash, cash
equivalents and investments, cash flow from operations and its available debt capacity to repurchase up to $4 billion of the Company’s common stock over the next two years. The Company is currently planning to increase its outstanding debt
balances to approximately 2.5 times the



Company’s net

debt-to-earnings

before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio to fund a
significant portion of these share repurchases.

In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company
to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a

two-year

period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available under the April 2018 authorization of $3 billion.
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company repurchased $1,306 million, $323 million and $318 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. The Company believes that it
has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and
profits.

During 2018, the Company entered into $300 million of

U.S.-to-Euro

interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company lowered
its net interest expense by $3 million during 2018. The Company anticipates that these swap agreements will lower net interest expense by approximately $9 million annually in 2019 and 2020, and less in 2021 as the three year term of the
agreements expire.

In January 2019, the Company made organizational changes to better align our resources with our growth and
innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 1% of the Company’s employees. The Company currently estimates that it will incur approximately $15 million of severance and related costs during 2019.

In 2018, sales in China increased across all product lines and were driven by double-digit increases in
sales to pharmaceutical, governmental and academic customers. The effect of foreign currency translation increased sales in Japan by 2% in 2018 and sales growth was also driven by increased sales to pharmaceutical and industrial customers. The sales
decline in the rest of Asia in 2018 was a result of lower customer demand in India and weaker sales to environmental customers in the first quarter of 2018. In 2018, sales growth in Europe was driven by TA’s products and services and recurring
revenues to pharmaceutical and industrial customers. In



addition, the effect of foreign currency translation increased sales in Europe by 3% in 2018. Sales growth in the U.S. in 2018 was driven by recurring revenues and TA instruments. Sales in the
rest of the Americas had double-digit sales growth for instrument systems and double-digit sales growth for pharmaceutical customers, which was offset by a decline in sales to industrial customers.

In 2017, the sales growth in Asia was driven by double-digit increases in China’s sales across all product and customer classes. The
increase in Asia Other in 2017 was driven by strong sales in India across all product and customer classes. Japan’s sales in 2017 were flat as the effect of foreign currency decreased sales by 3%. Japan’s sales in 2017 were driven by
recurring revenue sales to governmental and academic customers. Europe’s sales in 2017 were balanced across all product lines and driven by sales to pharmaceutical, governmental and academic customers. Sales growth in the U.S. in 2017 was
driven by TA instrument system sales and recurring revenues. In 2017, sales to the rest of the world were impacted by a decrease in demand from industrial customers resulting from recent natural disasters.

In 2018, sales to pharmaceutical customers were driven by recurring revenues, with double-digit growth in
China, Canada and Latin America. Sales growth for the industrial market in 2018 was driven by TA products and services, and

mid-single-digit

sales growth in Europe, Japan and India. The increase in sales to
governmental and academic customers in 2018 was broad-based across all product classes and geographies, with double-digit growth in China, India and Canada.

In 2017, the growth within our pharmaceutical market was driven by double-digit growth in China, India and Europe. Sales growth to the industrial market in 2017 was highest in China and India, with modest
growth in other regions offset by flat sales in the Americas. The increase in sales to governmental and academic customers in 2017 was broad-based across all geographies, with double-digit growth in Europe and the Americas.

Precision chemistry consumables sales increased in both 2018 and 2017 on the uptake in columns and
application-specific testing kits. Waters service sales in both 2018 and 2017 benefited from increased sales of



service plans and higher service demand billings to a higher installed base of customers. The increase in Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) in 2018 is primarily
attributable to sales of LC systems, while sales growth in 2017 was driven by higher sales of

LC-MS

systems that incorporate the Company’s tandem quadrupole technologies. The effect of foreign currency
translation had a minimal impact on Waters sales in both 2018 and 2017.

In 2018, Waters sales increased 7% in Asia, 4% in
Europe and 2% in the Americas. Waters sales increased 15% in China in 2018 and were broad-based across all product classes, with double-digit increases in sales to pharmaceutical, governmental and academic customers. Waters sales in Japan in 2018
increased 5%, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales 2%. Sales in the rest of Asia declined 2% in 2018, primarily due to lower customer demand in India and a negative 2% impact of foreign currency translation. In the
Americas, U.S. sales increased 1% in 2018.

In 2017, Waters sales increased 10% in both Europe and Asia and were flat in the
Americas. Waters sales increased 16% in China and were broad-based across all product and customer classes. Waters sales in Japan decreased 1%, primarily due to foreign currency translation, which decreased sales by 3%. Waters sales in the rest of
Asia increased 8% and were driven by recurring revenues across all customer classes.

TA’s instrument system sales were broad-based across all product classes in 2018, while 2017
instrument system sales grew primarily from the Discovery product line of thermal instrument systems. In addition, TA’s rheology instrument systems saw strong performance across the entire range of products in the portfolio in 2017, driven by
the Discovery Hybrid Rheometer and Rubber Rheometer instrument systems. TA service sales increased in both 2018 and 2017 due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation
and recent acquisitions had a minimal impact on TA’s sales in both 2018 and 2017.

In 2018, TA sales increased 9% in the
Americas, 8% in Europe and 5% in Asia. TA sales in the U.S. increased 9% in 2018, while sales in the rest of the Americas increased 8%. TA’s sales in Asia were driven by double-digit sales growth in India and 8% sales growth in China, which was
offset by declines in Japan.

In 2017, TA sales increased 14% in Asia, 11% in Europe and 5% in the Americas. TA achieved
double-digit sales growth in Asia, with the exception of Japan, where a 5% sales growth included a 2% negative impact of foreign currency translation. TA sales in the U.S. in 2017 increased 8%, while sales in the rest of the Americas declined after
strong sales in the prior year.

Cost of Sales

The increases in cost of sales for both 2018 and 2017 were consistent with the increase in sales volumes. The effect of foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on cost of sales in both 2018 and
2017.

Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix,
product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects that the impact of foreign currency translation may decrease sales and gross profit during 2019.



Selling and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses decreased 1% in 2018 and increased 6% in 2017. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to the impact of $13 million of severance costs incurred in 2017 in
connection with the closure of a facility in Germany and an early retirement transition incentive program. The effect of foreign currency translation increased selling and administrative expenses by 3% in 2017 and had a minimal impact in 2018. In
addition, selling and administrative expenses in both 2018 and 2017 were impacted by headcount additions and higher merit compensation costs, as well as $1 million and $4 million, respectively, of stock compensation expense related to the
modification of certain stock awards upon the retirement of senior executives.

As a percentage of net sales, selling and
administrative expenses were 22.2%, 23.6% and 23.6% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased 8% and 6% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Research and development expenses in both 2018 and
2017 were impacted by additional headcount, merit compensation and costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation reduced research and development
expenses by 4% in 2017, primarily due to the weakening of the British pound on the Company’s U.K.-based research and development expenses. Foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on research and development costs in 2018.

Litigation Settlement

In the second
quarter of 2017, the Company incurred an $11 million litigation provision related to the issuance of a verdict in a patent litigation case. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company resolved the case with a final settlement that resulted
in a gain of $2 million.

Acquired

In-Process

Research and Development

During 2017, the Company incurred charges of $5 million for acquired

in-process

research and development
related to milestone payments associated with a licensing arrangement for certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and for which there was no future alternative use as of the acquisition date.
These licensing arrangements are significantly related to new, biologically-focused applications, as well as other applications, and require the Company to make additional future payments of up to $7 million if certain milestones are achieved,
as well as royalties on future net sales. These future payments may be significant and occur over multiple years.

Interest Expense, Net

The decrease in net interest expense in 2018 was primarily attributable to the Company using cash, cash equivalents and investment
balances recently repatriated into the U.S. to reduce its debt by $850 million during the 2018, as well as higher yields on investments. The Company is currently planning to increase its outstanding debt balances in the future and, as a result,
the Company is expecting its net interest expense to increase by an estimated $25 million in 2019 at current interest rates.

In 2018, the Company entered into three-year

U.S.-to-Euro

interest rate cross-currency swap agreements with a notional value
of $300 million that hedges the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap agreement is recorded as interest income.
During 2018, the Company recorded $3 million of interest income related to these agreements. This interest rate cross-currency swap agreement is estimated to generate $9 million of interest income annually over a three-year period.



Provision for Income Taxes

The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of
December 31, 2018. The Company has a contractual tax rate in Singapore of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to continue to meet.
The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income in 2018, 2017 and 2016 by $28 million, $25 million and
$23 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.36, $0.31 and $0.29, respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rates were 13.0%, 96.8% and 13.1% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were impacted by the following:

•

In December 2017, the U.S. enacted legislation informally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). For the year ended
December 31, 2017 the Company accrued a $550 million tax provision related to the 2017 Tax Act. The $550 million expense consisted of $490 million related to the federal transition tax, $40 million for state income taxes and
foreign withholding taxes and $20 million for the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal tax rate of 21%. This provision reduced net income per diluted share by $6.82 in 2017, and the
Company’s effective tax rate was 11.0% excluding this $550 million provision.

•

During 2018, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations on the federal transition tax and various other aspects of the Tax Reform law.
The Company finalized its analysis of the transition tax and related liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2018 pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 118. As a result of the new guidance issued and additional work to complete the calculation of its federal transition tax, the Company reduced its provisional accrual for federal, state and foreign taxes by net $24 million during 2018.
In addition, the Company also assessed its uncertain tax positions related to these taxes and accrued income tax reserves of $18 million during 2018. The net favorable impact to the 2018 provision for income taxes is $6 million.

•

The provision for income taxes for 2018 includes a $7 million expense related to the 2017 Tax Act. This additional tax results from the change in
foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed on December 31, 2017 under 2017 Tax Act as compared with the foreign currency exchange rates on the date of distribution of assets into the U.S. We do not expect this expense to recur in
future periods.

•

The 2018 effective income tax rate of 13.0% was impacted by the reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the 2017
Tax Act, which decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 2.0 percentage points as compared to 2017. The 2017 Tax act also added a new Global Intangible

Low-Taxed

Income (GILTI) tax, which increased
the Company’s 2018 effective tax rate by approximately 2.0 percentage points.

•

After the completion of the Company’s review of its capital allocation strategy in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company determined that it will
provide income taxes on all future foreign earnings from 2018 forward. As a result, this change added 0.6 percentage points to the 2018 effective tax rate as compared to 2017.

•

In addition, the reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the 2017 Tax Act also reduced the 2018 tax benefit on
stock compensation. The Company recorded a tax benefit on stock-based compensation in 2018 and 2017 that decreased income tax expense by $9 million and $20 million, respectively, and added $0.11 and $0.24 to net income per diluted share,
respectively.

•

The difference between the 2017 and 2016 effective tax rates can be attributed primarily to the 2016 provision for income taxes including a
$3 million tax benefit (0.7 percentage points) related to the release of a valuation allowance on certain net operating loss carryforwards.



The remaining differences between effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to
differences in the proportionate amounts of

pre-tax

income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates.

The Company’s effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors, including, but not limited to, the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates; sales
volumes and profit levels in each tax jurisdiction; changes in tax laws, tax rates and policies; the outcome of various ongoing tax audit examinations; and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation. In addition, upon completion of
the Company’s review of its capital allocation strategy in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company has determined that it will provide income taxes on all future foreign earnings. The Company estimates that this will increase the Company’s
effective income tax rate by approximately one percentage point in the future. However, the Company will continue to be permanently reinvested in relation to the cumulative historical outside basis difference that is not related to earnings. As a
result of variability in these factors, the Company’s effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the effective tax rates for the current or prior years, or for previously forecasted periods.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $604 million, $698 million and $643 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities
include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income:

•

The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding was
74 days at December 31, 2018 and 71 days at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.



•

The changes in inventory were primarily attributable to anticipated annual increases in sales volumes, as well as new product launches.

•

The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were the result of timing of payments to vendors. In addition, the change in 2018
included $103 million of income tax payments made in the U.S. relating to the Company’s estimated 2017 tax reform liability and 2018 estimated income tax payments and a $15 million litigation settlement payment.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of
customers renew annual service contracts.

•

Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current
assets, other assets, other liabilities, and income tax expenses related to the 2017 Tax Act. In addition, the Company made $11 million of contributions to certain defined benefit pension plans.

In addition, as a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation, the Company reclassified
$14 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in 2016 from cash flows from financing activities to cash flows from operating activities.

Cash Provided By (Used in) Investing Activities

Net cash provided by investing activities
totaled $1,683 million in 2018, while net cash used in investing activities totaled $536 million and $488 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $96 million,
$85 million and $95 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its chemistry synthesis operations in the U.S. The Company anticipates spending an estimated
$215 million to build and equip this new

state-of-the-art

manufacturing facility, which will be paid for with existing cash,
investments and debt capacity.

During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company purchased $1.0 billion, $3.0 billion and
$2.4 billion of investments, respectively, while $2.8 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion of investments matured, respectively. Most of the proceeds received in 2018 were repatriated into the U.S. at lower income tax rates as
a result of the 2017 Tax Act and used to reduce the Company’s debt by $850 million and fund the Company’s share repurchase program.

Asset and business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $31 million and $6 million during 2018 and 2016, respectively. There were no business acquisitions in 2017. During 2018, the Company
made $8 million of investments in unaffiliated companies. During 2017, the Company made a $7 million payment for an investment in a developer of analytical system solutions used to make measurements, predict stability and accelerate
product discovery in the routine analytic, process monitoring and quality control release processes for life science and biopharmaceutical markets. During 2017, the Company made payments of $5 million to acquire and license intellectual
property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized. In 2016, the Company sold an equity investment for $4 million.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

In November 2017, the Company entered into a credit
agreement (the “2017 Credit Agreement”), which provides for a $1.5 billion revolving facility and a $300 million term loan. The revolving facility and term loan both mature on November 30, 2022 and require no scheduled
prepayments before that date.

The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option,
equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (c) the
adjusted



LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the
applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for
alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2017 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount
of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four
consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events
of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities.

Interest on the Company’s fixed rate senior
unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the
aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for Series H and J senior unsecured notes. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the
Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio
test of not less than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants,
affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default.

During 2018, the Company’s net debt
borrowings decreased by $850 million, using cash repatriated under the 2017 Tax Act. During 2017 and 2016, the Company’s net debt borrowings increased $170 million and $160 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the
Company had a total of $1.1 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $560 million in outstanding senior unsecured notes, $300 million borrowed under a term loan and $290 million borrowed under a revolving credit facility,
with both the term loan and revolving credit facilities under the 2017 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $1,208 million after outstanding
letters of credit. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.

During 2018, the
Company entered into $300 million of

U.S.-to-Euro

interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated
net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $9 million annually over the three-year term of the agreements.

In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding
common stock over a

two-year

period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available under the April 2018 authorization of $3 billion. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company repurchased
6.8 million, 1.8 million and 2.3 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $1,306 million, $323 million and $318 million, respectively, under the April 2018 authorization and other
previously announced programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $10 million, $10 million and $8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

The Company received $52 million, $98 million and $62 million of proceeds from the exercise of
stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1,735 million as of December 31, 2018. The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments are generated from
foreign operations, with



$471 million held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2018, of which $251 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The Company believes it has sufficient levels
of cash flow and access to its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest, finance potential acquisitions and continue the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S. These
cash requirements are managed by the Company’s cash flow from operations, its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, and the use of the Company’s revolving credit facility.

Management believes, as of the date of this report, that the Company’s financial position, along with expected future cash flows
from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending
requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. The Company has conducted a

post-tax

reform evaluation of its capital allocation strategy and
the Company is currently planning to use its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash flow from operations and its available debt capacity to repurchase up to $4 billion of the Company’s common stock over the next two years.
The Company is currently planning to increase its outstanding debt balances to approximately 2.5 times the Company’s net

debt-to-earnings

before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization ratio to fund a significant portion of these share repurchases. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Company has determined that it will provide income taxes on all future foreign earnings and reverse its
historical assertion that its foreign earnings were permanently invested. However, the Company will continue to be permanently reinvested in relation to the cumulative historical outside basis difference that is not related to the unremitted
earnings. There have been no other significant changes to the Company’s financial position.

The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which
is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (c) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business

Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an
interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as



of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017
Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all such
covenants.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in
the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

The Company has long-term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and
supplemental executive retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether the employee elects

lump-sum

or annuity payments. During fiscal year 2019, the Company expects to contribute approximately $3 million to $6 million to the Company’s defined benefit plans.

The Company has contingent consideration for an earnout pertaining to its July 2014 acquisition of the net assets of Medimass Research,
Development and Service Kft. (“Medimass”). The earnout payments are not included above since they are dependent upon many factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as of
December 31, 2018 is $2 million.

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties. Future
minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2018 are immaterial. The Company enters into licensing arrangements with third parties that require future milestone or royalty payments contingent upon future
events. Upon the achievement of certain milestones in existing agreements, the Company could make additional future payments of up to $7 million, as well as royalties on future net sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty
whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table above.

The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of
uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits
associated with those positions for the time value of money. The Company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. If all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits
accrued as of December 31, 2018 were to become recognizable in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of approximately $26 million in its income tax provision.

With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on
or before December 31, 2013. However, carryforward tax attributes that were generated in years beginning on or before January 1, 2014 may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if the attributes are utilized. The Company
continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.



As of December 31, 2018, the Company expects to record additional reductions in
the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of approximately $1 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax
assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future.

Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangements

The Company has not
created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or

off-balance

sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of
the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other
contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support
to the Company.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to
these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent,
copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its
subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such
indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Summary

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the
Company’s financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations given changes in the
estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Company’s consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not
deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

The Company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the recognition
of revenue from contracts with customers as of January 1, 2018 and applied the modified-retrospective method. The Company elected the practical expedient and only evaluated the contracts that were considered incomplete as of January 1,
2018 when quantifying the cumulative effect adjustment under the modified retrospective method. Ultimately, the Company



determined that there was not a significant change in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for the Company’s products and services. The adoption of this standard did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows and, as such, did not require any adjustments to information reported in the prior year. The revenue recognition policies described below were effective as
of January 1, 2018.

The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services. Revenue is allocated
to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts.

The Company recognizes
revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer. In substantially all of the Company’s arrangements, title of the product transfers at shipping point and, as a result, the Company determined control
transfers at the point of shipment. In more limited cases, there are destination-based shipping terms and, thus, control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site. All incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed
as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. In situations where the control of the goods
transfers prior to the completion of the Company’s obligation to ship the products to its customers, the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost. Accordingly, such costs are
recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to the customer. In more rare situations, the Company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized
before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. The Company elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific
revenue-producing transactions and collected by the Company from a customer.

Generally, the Company’s contracts for
products include a performance obligation related to installation. The Company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation. The Company
determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service, which requires judgment. The Company determines relative standalone selling price of
installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours. In developing these estimates, the Company considers past history, competition, billing rates of current services and other
factors.

The Company has sales from standalone software, which is included in instrument systems revenue. These arrangements
typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which the Company has determined are distinct performance obligations. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance
contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance
contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified
rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a

when-and-if-available

basis.

Payment terms and conditions vary among the Company’s revenue streams, although terms generally include a requirement of payment
within 30 to 60 days of product shipment. Prior to providing payment terms to customers, an evaluation of the customer’s credit risk is performed. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to
sales. Rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and, therefore, there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products.



Service revenue includes (i) service and software maintenance contracts and
(ii) service calls (time and materials). Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. The amount of the service and
software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the maintenance service period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in
satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.

The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities at December 31, 2018 was $204 million on the consolidated balance
sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where
consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period.

Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If
the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request collateral from its customers, but
collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the
credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro-economic environment. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current
period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company’s
accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2018 was $568 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $8 million.

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a

first-in,

first-out

basis
(“FIFO”). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand, including that in the Company’s current backlog of orders, and industry and market
conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. The Company’s inventory balance at December 31, 2018 was recorded at its net realizable
value of $292 million, which is net of write-downs of $23 million.

Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, particularly as it pertains to capitalized software and
patent costs;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends, competitive products and technologies; and

•

significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Company’s capitalized patents,
purchased technology, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses.

When the Company determines
that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, an estimate of



undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether
impairment exists. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is written-down to its estimated fair value. Net intangible assets, long-lived assets and goodwill amounted
to $247 million, $343 million and $356 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018.

The Company
performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on January 1 of each year. For goodwill impairment review purposes, the Company has two reporting units: Waters and TA. The Company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in
the foreseeable future; however, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. The factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include,
but are not limited to, the following:

•

significant decline in the Company’s projected revenue, earnings or cash flows;

•

significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate;

•

significant decline in the Company’s stock price or the stock price of comparable companies;

•

adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and

•

unanticipated competition.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of
preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its income taxes, taking into account the amount,
timing and character of taxable income, tax deductions and credits and assessing changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties. Differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation, amortization and
inventory reserves, result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods,
such changes could materially impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

The accounting
standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets
will be realized in future periods.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax
consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax
benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money. The Company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. At December 31, 2018, the Company had
unrecognized tax benefits of $27 million.

The Company has been granted a 0% contractual tax rate in Singapore that
requires the achievement of certain operational and financial milestones that the Company expects to meet, to the extent not already achieved, by December 31, 2020 and maintain through at least March 31, 2021. As part of the Company’s
determination of uncertain tax positions, the Company regularly assesses its progress against these operational and financial milestone targets to determine whether the milestones can be reasonably achieved. These milestones were negotiated with the
Singaporean tax authorities and established based on the Company’s historical financial performance; the anticipated customer

end-market

demand, particularly in certain regions in the world, and the
Company’s anticipated future operating plans. These assessments require significant judgments and estimates



about the Company’s ability to meet the milestone targets for the following types of objectives: reaching and maintaining annual revenue and business spending targets; meeting capital
expenditures targets; attaining and sustaining employment targets; and establishing a local research and development and service center. The Company regularly monitors its actual and forecasted sales and operating results against these milestones
and the Company makes the determination as to whether the future forecasted financial results are most likely to be achieved. These milestones are very similar in nature to the previous Singaporean tax holiday contractual agreements that the Company
successfully completed. These milestones are not required to be met until December 21, 2020, at the earliest, which gives the Company sufficient time to make any necessary adjustments to its operating plans to achieve the milestones.

Currently, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in Singapore of 0%
and has not recognized an uncertain tax position in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in Singapore. However, these milestones can be significantly influenced by the business climate in Singapore and the
Company’s overall financial performance and, in the event that the Company determines that the milestone targets are not expected to be met, the Company would no longer be able to record a tax benefit at a 0% contractual tax rate on income
earned in Singapore from and after the April 1, 2016 start date of the contract period. At such time, the Company would record an income tax charge on the affected Singapore income earned back to April 1, 2016 at the Singapore statutory
tax rate(s) (currently 17%), with a corresponding income tax liability recorded on the balance sheet. For the year ended 2018, the effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in
Singapore increased the Company’s net income and net income per diluted share by $28 million and $0.36, respectively.

Warranty

Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive
product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs
incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Company’s previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At
December 31, 2018, the Company’s warranty liability was $12 million.

Litigation

As described in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this

Form 10-K,

the Company is a party to various
pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a
particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company
will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty.

Pension and Other Retirement Benefits

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Company’s pension plans and
other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant Company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets, are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 4.35% for its U.S. benefit plans and 2.75% for its

non-U.S.

benefit plans.

At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount
rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company utilized Milliman’s Bond Matching model to



determine the discount rate for its U.S. benefit plans. The Company determined the discount rate for its

non-U.S.

benefit plans based on the analysis of
the Mercer Pension Discount Curve for high quality investments as of December 31, 2018 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once the interest rates were
determined, the plan’s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. At December 31, 2018, the Company determined the weighted-average discount rate to be 4.40% for the U.S. benefit plans and 1.95% for
the

non-U.S.

benefits plans.

A

one-quarter

percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate of return would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than $1 million. A

one-quarter

percentage point increase in the
discount rate would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than $1 million.

Stock-based Compensation

The accounting standards for stock-based compensation require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements
of operations based on their fair values. The Company has used the Black-Scholes option pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards and performance stock unit awards, respectively. Under the
fair-value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards
at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s
results of operations could be materially impacted. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of the expense has been reduced for
estimated forfeitures. These accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on
historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the
Company has recorded in the current period. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method.

As
of December 31, 2018, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted-average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows (in millions):

Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions

The Company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations. The results of each acquisition are included in the Company’s consolidated results as of the
acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. Any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair
values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Acquired

in-process

research and development (“IPR&D”) included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived
intangible asset. Development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired IPR&D is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs. Upon commercialization, this indefinite-lived intangible
asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life,



subject to periodic impairment reviews. If the research and development project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business
valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.

The Company also acquires intellectual
property through licensing arrangements. These arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments, contingent upon certain future events. IPR&D acquired in an asset acquisition (as opposed to a
business combination) is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use. Subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed.
Payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset, and are classified as intangible assets.

Contingent Consideration

In addition to the initial cash consideration paid to acquire
Medimass, the Company is obligated to make additional earnout payments based on a royalty due on future sales of products containing the REIMS technology. In accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations, the Company determines
the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration at each reporting date using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results
of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including estimated future results and a discount rate reflective of the Company’s creditworthiness. A
change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. Although there is no contractual limit, total future undiscounted contingent consideration payments were estimated to be
$2 million as of December 31, 2018, based on the Company’s best estimate, as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products through 2034.

Recent Accounting Standard Changes and Developments

Information regarding recent
accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this document and should be considered an integral part of this Item 7. See Note 2 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards.

Item 7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Derivative Transactions

The Company is a
global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company
is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its

non-U.S.

dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars, and when any of the
Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency.

The
Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of
the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations
by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows.



Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain
third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates these net worldwide balances by currency and
then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not
designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real.

Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements

In 2018, the Company entered into three-year
interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of $300 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge
accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income
in the statement of operations.

The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap
agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands):

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in

year-end

exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2018 would decrease

pre-tax

earnings by approximately $15 million. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in

year-end

exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the
fair market value of the interest rate cross-currency swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2018 would increase by approximately $30 million and would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income
within stockholders’ equity. The related impact on interest income would not have a material effect on

pre-tax

earnings.

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in bank deposits, U.S. treasury bill money market funds and commercial paper. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents
approximated fair value.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash
generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of
December 31, 2018, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio.

The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts
in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $471 million out of $1,735 million and $3,326 million out of
$3,394 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $251 million out of $1,735 million and $304 million out of $3,394 million of
cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper
issued by structured investment vehicles.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in

year-end

exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of
December 31, 2018 would decrease by approximately $25 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.



Item 8:

Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control

— Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control

— Integrated Framework (2013)

, our management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which is included herein.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes and schedule of
valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 appearing under Item 15(c) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control
— Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based payment transactions
in 2017.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and
on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.



Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1    Description of Business and Organization

Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the
science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and
food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC

TM

” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and
mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently
employed together

(“LC-MS”)

and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify,
monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including
clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing.

LC-MS

instruments combine a liquid phase sample
introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA

TM

product line. These instruments are used in predicting the
suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and
supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments.

2    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the
dates of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, product returns and allowances, bad debts, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangible assets, income
taxes, warranty and installation provisions, litigation, retirement plan obligations, stock-based compensation, equity investments and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel,
protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or controls fifty percent or more
of the voting shares. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Translation of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the
Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong,
Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows.

For most of
the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the
respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company’s net sales derived from operations outside the United States were 72%, 71% and 69% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included
in net income in the consolidated statements of operations. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, foreign currency transactions resulted in net losses of $3 million, $1 million and $4 million, respectively.

Seasonality of Business

The Company
typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments

Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in bank deposits, U.S. treasury bill
money market funds and commercial paper. Investments with longer maturities are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. treasury bills, U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt
securities.

Investments are classified as

available-for-sale

in accordance with the accounting standards for investments in debt securities. All debt securities are recorded at fair market value and any
unrealized holding gains and losses, to the extent deemed temporary, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity, net of the related tax effects. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value
of the investment, the Company considers all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is “other than temporary” and, if so, records a loss as a charge to the statement of operations. The Company classifies its
investments exclusive of those categorized as cash equivalents.

The Company maintains cash balances in various operating
accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $471 million out of $1,735 million and $3,326 million out of
$3,394 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $251 million out of $1,735 million and $304 million out of $3,394 million of
cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash
considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the
existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number of factors, including historical experience and the customer’s credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. Past due balances
over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged against the allowance when the Company determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not
have any

off-balance

sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31,
2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products and services to a significant number of large and small customers throughout the world, with net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately 56% in each of the
years 2018, 2017 and 2016. None of the Company’s individual customers accounted for more than 2% of annual Company sales in 2018, 2017 or 2016. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral, but in certain circumstances may require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

Inventory

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable
value on a

first-in,

first-out

basis (“FIFO”).

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are
recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset
any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Appropriate long-term liabilities have also been recorded to recognize uncertain tax
positions.

As part of the 2017 Tax Act, there is a provision for the taxation of certain

off-shore

earnings referred to as the Global Intangible

Low-Taxed

Income (“GILTI”) provision. This new provision taxes

off-shore

earnings at a rate of 10.5%, partially offset with foreign tax credits. In connection with this new provision, the Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat this new tax as a current period
cost.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, while the costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is provided
using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings — fifteen to thirty years; building improvements — five to ten years; leasehold improvements — the shorter of the economic useful life
or life of lease; and production and other equipment — three to ten years. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated balance sheets and related
gains or losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

Asset Impairments

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment. Whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset based on the expected future cash flows, relying on a number of factors, including, but
not limited to, operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. If the asset is deemed not recoverable, it is written down to fair value and the impairment is recorded in the consolidated statements of
operations.

Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions

The Company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations. The results of each acquisition are included in the Company’s consolidated results as of the
acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. Any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair
values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Acquired

in-process

research and development (“IPR&D”) included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived
intangible asset. Development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired IPR&D is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs. Upon commercialization, this indefinite-lived intangible
asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, subject to periodic impairment reviews. If the research and development project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived
asset is charged to expense. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.

The Company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements. These arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments, contingent upon
certain future events. IPR&D acquired in an asset acquisition (as opposed to a business combination) is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use. Subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to
determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed. Payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset, and are classified as
intangible assets.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests for goodwill impairment using a fair-value approach at the reporting unit level annually, or earlier, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce
the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additionally, the Company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment for its reporting units as of January 1 each year. The goodwill and other intangible assets accounting
standards define a reporting unit as an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by management. For goodwill impairment review purposes, the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company has two reporting units: Waters

™

and TA

™

. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition. Under the impairment test, if a reporting
unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value of reporting units was estimated using
a discounted cash flows technique, which includes certain management assumptions, such as estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and discount rates.

The Company’s intangible assets include purchased technology; capitalized software development costs; costs associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as
licenses; debt issuance costs and acquired IPR&D. Purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years. Other intangibles are
amortized over a period ranging from one to ten years. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the related debt. Acquired IPR&D is amortized from the date of completion of the acquired program over its estimated useful life. IPR&D
and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested annually for impairment.

Software Development Costs

The Company capitalizes internal and external software development costs for products offered for sale in accordance with the accounting standards for the
costs of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. Capitalized costs are amortized to cost of sales over the period of economic benefit, which approximates a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software
products, generally three to ten years. The Company capitalized $34 million and $35 million of direct expenses that were related to the development of software in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net capitalized software included in intangible
assets totaled $147 million and $153 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 8, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles”.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs for internal use. Capitalized internal software development costs are amortized over the period of economic benefit, which approximates a
straight-line basis over ten years. Net capitalized internal software included in property, plant and equipment totaled $2 million and $3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Other Investments

The Company accounts
for its investments that represent less than twenty percent ownership, and for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, using the accounting standards for investments in equity securities. Investments for which
the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, and for which there is not a readily determinable market value, are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of
its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. For investments in which the Company owns or controls between twenty and forty-nine percent of the voting
shares, or over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, the equity method of accounting is used. The Company’s share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in the
consolidated statements of operations and was not material in any period presented.

During the year ended December 31,
2018, the Company made $8 million of investments in unaffiliated companies. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made a $7 million investment in a developer of analytical system solutions used to make measurements,
predict stability and accelerate product discovery in the routine analytic, process monitoring and quality control release processes for life science and biopharmaceutical markets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company sold an
equity investment that was accounted for using the equity method of accounting and was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet for $4 million in cash.

Fair Value Measurements

In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active
markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets

The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the
plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges.

Fair
Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements

The fair
values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued
at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current
spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources.

Fair Value of Contingent Consideration

The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the July 2014 acquisition of
Medimass Research, Development and Service Kft. and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of
the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the estimated future results
and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent
consideration. Although there



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

is no contractual limit, the fair value of future contingent consideration payments was estimated to be $2 million and $3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, based
on the Company’s best estimate, as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products, some of which are currently in development, through 2034.

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments

The Company’s accounts receivable, accounts
payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $510 million and $610 million at
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions
for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $502 million and $608 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, using Level 2 inputs.

Derivative Transactions

The Company is
a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The
Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its

non-U.S.

dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars, and when any
of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency.

The
Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of
the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations
by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows.

Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain
third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and
then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not
designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real.

Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements

In 2018, the Company entered into three-year
interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of $300 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge
accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income
in the statement of operations.

Stockholders’ Equity

In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a

two-year

period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available under the April 2018 authorization of $3 billion. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company repurchased 6.8 million, 1.8 million and 2.3 million shares of the
Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $1,329 million, $323 million and $318 million, respectively, under the April 2018 authorization and other previously announced programs. In addition, the Company repurchased
$10 million, $10 million and $8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company believes that it has the financial
flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits.

In December 2018, the Company accrued $23 million as a result of treasury stock purchases that were unsettled as of
December 31, 2018. These transactions were settled in January 2019.

Product Warranty Costs

The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of
operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure
rates, material usage and service delivery costs



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired
and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

The following is

Advertising Costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expenses were $7 million,
$6 million and $11 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and benefits,
facilities costs, overhead costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. During 2017, the Company incurred a $5 million charge for acquired

in-process

research and development related to the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and for which there was no future alternative
use as of the acquisition date. These licensing arrangements are significantly related to new, biologically-focused applications, as well as other applications, and require the Company to make additional future payments of up to $7 million if
certain milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on future net sales.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has two stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 13, “Stock-Based Compensation”.

Earnings Per Share

In accordance with
the earnings per share accounting standards, the Company presents two earnings per share (“EPS”) amounts. Income per basic common share is based on income available to common shareholders and the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the periods presented. Income per diluted common share includes additional dilution from potential common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding.

Retirement Plans

The Company sponsors
various retirement plans, which are described in Note 16, “Retirement Plans”.

Comprehensive Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with the accounting standards for comprehensive income, which establish the accounting rules
for reporting and displaying comprehensive income.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

These standards require that all components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements.

Subsequent Events

In January 2019, the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a

two-year

period. See discussion under the heading, “Stockholders’
Equity”, above.

In January 2019, the Company made organizational changes to better align our resources with our growth
and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 1% of the Company’s employees. The Company currently estimates that it will incur approximately $15 million of severance and related costs during 2019.

In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the Company’s credit
agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive
quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior
unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases.

Recently Adopted Accounting
Standards

In May 2014, amended accounting guidance was issued regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The
objective of this guidance is to significantly enhance comparability and clarify principles of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. This guidance was originally effective for annual and
interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended the standard in August 2015 to delay the effective period date by one year to annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption prior to December 15, 2016 was not permitted. In March 2016, the FASB clarified the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and, in April 2016, clarification was made
regarding certain aspects of identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, additional guidance was issued related to disclosure of remaining performance obligations, as well as other amendments to guidance
on collectibility,

non-cash

consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes collected from customers. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 and applied the
modified-retrospective method. The Company elected the practical expedient and only evaluated the contracts that were considered incomplete as of January 1, 2018 when quantifying the cumulative effect adjustment under the modified retrospective
method. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows and, as such, did not require any adjustments to information reported in the prior year.

In January 2016, accounting guidance was issued which primarily affects the classification and measurement of certain financial
instruments, principally equity investments and certain financial liabilities. Under the new guidance, there will no longer be an

available-for-sale

classification for
equity securities with readily determinable fair values. Changes to the fair value of equity investments will be recognized through earnings. Equity investments carried at cost should be adjusted for changes in observable prices, as applicable, and
qualitatively assessed for impairment annually. Changes to the fair value of financial liabilities under the fair value option due to instrument specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income. The new guidance also
requires financial assets and financial liabilities to be presented separately and grouped by



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

measurement category in the notes to the financial statements. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In August 2016, accounting guidance was issued that
clarifies the classification of certain cash flows. The new guidance addresses eight specific areas where current accounting guidance is either unclear or does not specifically address classification issues. This guidance is effective for annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s cash flows.

In October 2016, accounting guidance was issued regarding intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The new
guidance eliminates the deferral of tax effects on intra-entity transfers other than inventory and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018
with a $4 million charge to beginning retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet. Please see Note 10, “Income Taxes”, for additional information.

In January 2017, accounting guidance was issued that clarifies the definition of a business. The new guidance provides a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is
a business, thus narrowing the definition and the amount of transactions accounted for as business combinations. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 and will apply this guidance prospectively to any business combination
transactions that take place in the future.

In March 2017, accounting guidance was issued regarding the presentation of net
periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The new guidance requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from other components of net benefit cost, with service cost reported in the same line items as
other compensation costs and the other components of net benefit costs presented outside income from operations. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 and has reported the components of net periodic benefit cost other than the
service cost component in other income on the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Please see Note 16, “Retirement Plans”, for additional information.

In May 2017, accounting guidance was issued that clarifies the accounting for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based
payment award. The standard provides more specific guidance for determining when a change to an award requires modification accounting and when it should be deemed purely administrative in nature. The Company adopted this standard as of
January 1, 2018 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In August 2017, accounting guidance was issued which simplifies the application of hedge accounting and enables companies to better portray the economics of their risk management activities in their
financial statements. The Company adopted this standard in the second quarter of 2018, and this adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In
February 2016, accounting guidance was issued regarding the accounting for leases. This new comprehensive lease standard amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases. The core principle of the new guidance will require lessees
to present the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on their balance sheets. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted
this standard using a modified retrospective transition approach to be applied to leases existing as of, or entered into after, January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company’s balance sheet by
recording a

right-of-use

lease asset and lease liability



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

that is estimated to be approximately $97 million; however, it will not have an overall material impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows.

In June 2016, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the recognition of credit losses related to financial assets, such as debt
securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases,

off-balance

sheet credit exposures, and other financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash. Current guidance requires the
recognition of a credit loss when it is considered probable that a loss event has occurred. The new guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based upon relevant information, including historical experience, current
conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the asset. As such, expected credit losses may be recognized sooner under the new guidance due to the broader range of information that will be required to
determine credit loss estimates. The new guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model used for debt securities classified as

available-for-sale.

When the fair value of an

available-for-sale

debt security is below
its amortized cost, the new guidance requires the total unrealized loss to be bifurcated into its credit and

non-credit

components. Any expected credit losses or subsequent recoveries will be recognized in
earnings and any changes not considered credit related will continue to be recognized within other comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company currently does not
expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In January 2017, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical
purchase price allocation. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company currently does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a
material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In March 2017, accounting
guidance was issued to amend the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Specifically, the amortization period for certain callable debt securities will be shortened to end at the earliest call date.
This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company currently does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February 2018, accounting guidance was issued to
address the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on items recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Current accounting guidance requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates
with the effect recorded in income from continuing operations, even if the related tax effects were originally recognized in other comprehensive income, the new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to
retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the
adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial,
clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirement identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does
not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of retirement benefit plans. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial,
clarify the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirement identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and
early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

3    Revenue Recognition

The Company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers as of January 1, 2018 and applied the modified-retrospective method. The Company elected
the practical expedient and only evaluated the contracts that were considered incomplete as of January 1, 2018 when quantifying the cumulative effect adjustment under the modified retrospective method. Ultimately, the Company determined that
there was not a significant change in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for the Company’s products and services. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of
operations or cash flows and, as such, did not require any adjustments to information reported in the prior year. The revenue recognition policies described below were effective as of January 1, 2018.

The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services. Revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is
recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts.

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control
of the product transfers to the customer. In substantially all of the Company’s arrangements, title of the product transfers at shipping point and, as a result, the Company determined control transfers at the point of shipment. In more limited
cases, there are destination-based shipping terms and, thus, control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site. All incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected amortization
period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. In situations where the control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of the Company’s
obligation to ship the products to its customers, the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost. Accordingly, such costs are recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to
the customer. In more rare situations, the Company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. The Company
elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions and collected by the Company from a customer.

Generally, the Company’s contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation. The Company
has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation
service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service, which requires judgment. The Company determines relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates
and estimated installation hours. In developing these estimates, the Company considers past history, competition, billing rates of current services and other factors.

The Company has sales from standalone software, which is included in instrument systems revenue. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which the Company
has determined are distinct performance obligations. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when
control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of
progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a

when-and-if-available

basis.

Payment terms and conditions vary among the Company’s revenue streams, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment. Prior to providing payment
terms to customers, an evaluation of the customer’s credit risk is performed. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and,
therefore, there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products.

Service revenue
includes (i) service and software maintenance contracts and (ii) service calls (time and materials). Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the
contract or maintenance period. The amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the maintenance service period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure
of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls are
recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.

The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts,
where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period.

Company’s deferred revenue and customer advances for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its precision chemistry
consumable manufacturing operations in the U.S. The Company anticipates spending an estimated $215 million to build and equip this new

state-of-the-art

manufacturing facility, and has spent $11 million on this facility through December 31, 2018.

During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company retired and disposed of approximately $9 million, $15 million and
$15 million of property, plant and equipment, respectively, most of which was fully depreciated and no longer in use. Gains on disposal were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

7    Acquisitions

In July 2018, the Company acquired the sole intellectual property rights to the Desorption Electrospray Ionization (“DESI”) imaging technology for $30 million in cash and a future
contractual obligation to pay a minimum royalty of $3 million over the remaining life of the patent. DESI is a mass spectrometry imaging technique that is used to develop medical therapies. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset
acquisition as it did not meet the definition of a business. The Company allocated $33 million of fair value to a purchased intangible asset which will be amortized over the useful life of 12 years.

In September 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Rubotherm GmbH (“Rubotherm”), a manufacturer of
gravimetric analysis systems, for approximately $6 million in cash, $5 million of which was paid at closing and an additional $1 million paid after closing to settle certain liabilities. Rubotherm develops and manufactures analytical
test instruments for thermogravimetric and sorption measurements that are used in both industrial and academic research laboratories in disciplines that include chemistry, material science and engineering. The Rubotherm acquisition will help support
and further expand product offerings within TA’s thermal analysis business.

In each acquisition, the sellers provided
the Company with customary representations, warranties and indemnification, which would be settled in the future if and when a breach of the contractual representation or warranty condition occurs. The pro forma effect of the ongoing operations for
Waters Corporation, the DESI imaging technology and Rubotherm, either individually or in the aggregate, as though these acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the periods covered by this report was immaterial.

8    Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The carrying amount of goodwill was $356 million and $360 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the effect of foreign currency
translation decreased goodwill by $4 million.

9    Debt

In November 2017, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $1.5 billion revolving facility and a $300 million term loan. The
revolving facility and term loan both mature on November 30, 2022 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date.

The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate
(which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (c) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such
day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for
Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate
or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2017 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017
Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1
as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had a total of $560 million and $700 million of outstanding
senior unsecured notes, respectively. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior
unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for Series H and J senior unsecured notes. In the event of a change in control of
the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes
require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these
senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default.

In 2018, the Company entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of $300 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency
exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. See Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

and 2016 by $28 million, $25 million and $23 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.36, $0.31 and $0.29, respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rates were 13.0%, 96.8% and 13.1% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively, and were impacted by the following:

•

In December 2017, the U.S. enacted legislation informally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). For the year ended
December 31, 2017 the Company accrued a $550 million tax provision related to the 2017 Tax Act. The $550 million expense consisted of $490 million related to the federal transition tax, $40 million for state income taxes and
foreign withholding taxes and $20 million for the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal tax rate of 21%. This provision reduced net income per diluted share by $6.82 in 2017, and the
Company’s effective tax rate was 11.0% excluding this $550 million provision.

•

During 2018, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations on the federal transition tax and various other aspects of the Tax Reform law.
The Company finalized its analysis of the transition tax and related liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2018 pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 118. As a result of the new guidance issued and additional work to complete the calculation of its federal transition tax, the Company reduced its provisional accrual for federal, state and foreign taxes by net $24 million during 2018.
In addition, the Company also assessed its uncertain tax positions related to these taxes and accrued income tax reserves of $18 million during 2018. The net favorable impact to the 2018 provision for income taxes is $6 million.

•

The provision for income taxes for 2018 includes a $7 million expense related to the 2017 Tax Act. This additional tax results from the change in
foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed on December 31, 2017 under 2017 Tax Act as compared with the foreign currency exchange rates on the date of distribution of assets into the U.S. We do not expect this expense to recur in
future periods.

•

The 2018 effective income tax rate of 13.0% was impacted by the reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the 2017
Tax Act, which decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by 2.0 percentage points as compared to 2017. The 2017 Tax act also added a new Global Intangible

Low-Taxed

Income (GILTI) tax, which increased
the Company’s 2018 effective tax rate by approximately 2.0 percentage points.

•

After the completion of the Company’s review of its capital allocation strategy in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company determined that it will
provide income taxes on all future foreign earnings from 2018 forward. As a result, this change added 0.6 percentage points to the 2018 effective tax rate as compared to 2017.

•

In addition, the reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the 2017 Tax Act also reduced the 2018 tax benefit on
stock compensation. The Company recorded a tax benefit on stock-based compensation in 2018 and 2017 that decreased income tax expense by $9 million and $20 million, respectively, and added $0.11 and $0.24 to net income per diluted share,
respectively.

•

The difference between the 2017 and 2016 effective tax rates can be attributed primarily to the 2016 provision for income taxes including a
$3 million tax benefit (0.7 percentage points) related to the release of a valuation allowance on certain net operating loss carryforwards.

The remaining differences between effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of

pre-tax

income recognized in
jurisdictions with different effective tax rates.

The Company has gross foreign net operating losses of $240 million that do not expire under current
laws. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of $54 million, of which $51 million relates to certain foreign net operating losses. The Company’s net deferred tax assets associated
with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are approximately $12 million as of December 31, 2018, which represent the future tax benefit of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that do not expire under current law.

As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation in 2017, the Company no longer
records excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in equity. The income tax benefits associated with equity compensation expense recognized for tax purposes and credited to income tax expense were $9 million and $20 million
for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the income tax benefit recognized for tax purposes and credited to additional

paid-in

capital was
$14 million.

The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income
taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions, as well as all of the
pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
as a component of the provision for income taxes.

With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant
jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2013. However, carryforward tax attributes that were generated in years beginning on or before January 1, 2014 may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if the
attributes are utilized. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax
assets and liabilities.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company expects to record additional reductions in the measurement
of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of approximately $1 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments.
The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

In addition, upon completion of the Company’s review of its capital allocation strategy in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company has determined that it will provide income taxes on all future
foreign earnings. However, the Company will continue to be permanently reinvested in relation to the cumulative historical outside basis difference that is not related to earnings. The determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on
cumulative historical outside basis differences that are not related to earnings is not practicable.

The Company adopted new
accounting guidance which eliminates the deferral of tax effects on intra-entity transfers other than inventory and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted this standard as of
January 1, 2018 with a $4 million charge to beginning retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet.

11    Litigation

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company
believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. During the
year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $11 million of litigation provisions and related costs, primarily related to the issuance of a verdict in a patent litigation case. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company resolved
the case with a final settlement that resulted in a gain of $2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $4 million of litigation provisions and related costs. The accrued patent litigation expense is in
other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

royalty payments contingent upon future events. Upon the achievement of certain milestones in existing agreements, the Company could make additional future payments of up to $7 million, as well as royalties on future net sales.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company
indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other
intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The
maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements
have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.

13    Stock-Based Compensation

In May 2012, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (“2012 Plan”). As of December 31, 2018, the 2012 Plan has 2.4 million shares
available for grant in the form of incentive or

non-qualified

stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units or other types of
awards. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options, restricted stock unit conversion or performance stock unit conversion. Under the 2012 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair
market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2012 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 9, 2022. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable
as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock, and
restricted stock units and performance stock units may be issued under the 2012 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had stock options,
restricted stock and restricted and performance stock unit awards outstanding.

In May 2009, the Company’s
shareholders approved the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which eligible employees may contribute up to 15% of their earnings toward the quarterly purchase of the Company’s common stock. The plan makes available 0.9 million shares
of the Company’s common stock, which includes the remaining shares available under the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2018, 1.4 million shares have been issued under both the 2009 and 1996 Employee Stock
Purchase Plans. Each plan period lasts



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

three months beginning on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. The purchase price for each share of stock is the lesser of 90% of the market price on the
first day of the plan period or 100% of the market price on the last day of the plan period. Stock-based compensation expense related to this plan was $1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based
compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The
stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated
based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different
assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period.

The consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the following stock-based
compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands):

Stock Options

In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a
variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company
uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of
historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of

non-qualified

stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury

zero-coupon

issues with a remaining term
approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised (i.e., the
difference between the market price at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the options) was $44 million, $76 million and $53 million, respectively. The total cash received from the exercise of these stock options
was $45 million, $91 million and $56 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding stock options at December 31, 2018 was $86 million. Options exercisable at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 0.8 million,
0.9 million and 1.3 million, respectively. The weighted-average exercise prices of options exercisable at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $117.08, $103.63 and $92.26, respectively. The weighted-average remaining contractual life
of the exercisable outstanding stock options at December 31, 2018 was 5.8 years.

At December 31, 2018, the
Company had 1.8 million stock options that are vested and expected to vest. The intrinsic value, weighted-average exercise price and remaining contractual life of the vested and expected to vest stock options were $86 million, $142.18 and
7.1 years, respectively, at December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2018, there were $41 million of total
unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock option awards that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted Stock

During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company granted five thousand, eight thousand and ten thousand shares of restricted stock, respectively. The weighted-average fair value
per share on the grant date of the restricted stock granted in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $194.73, $130.35 and $113.88, respectively. The Company has recorded $1 million of compensation expense in each of the years ended December 31, 2018,
2017 and 2016 related to the restricted stock grants. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had five thousand unvested shares of restricted stock outstanding, which have been fully expensed.

Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments
over a five-year period. The amount of compensation costs recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 on the restricted stock units expected to vest were $16 million, $17 million and $17 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018, there were $32 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the restricted stock unit awards that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
3.2 years.

Performance Stock Units

The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the
components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0% to 200% of the target shares awarded.

In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including
volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded
options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how
future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on

16    Retirement Plans

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters Employee Investment Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution plan, immediately upon hire. Employees may contribute up to 60% of eligible pay on a

pre-tax

or

post-tax

basis and the Company makes matching contributions of 100% for contributions up to 6% of eligible pay. The Company also sponsors a 401(k) Restoration Plan,
which is a nonqualified defined contribution plan. Employees are 100% vested in employee and Company matching contributions for both plans. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s matching contributions amounted
to $17 million, $16 million and $15 million, respectively.

The Company adopted new accounting guidance which
requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from other components of net benefit cost. As a result of the adoption of this standard, the components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost component are included
in other income in the consolidated statements of operations and all previous periods have been adjusted accordingly.

In May
2018, the Company’s board of directors approved the termination of two defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. for which the pay credit accruals have been frozen, the Waters Retirement Plan and the Waters Retirement Restoration Plan
(collectively, the “U.S. Pension Plans”). In December 2018, the Company settled the Waters Retirement Plan obligation by making

lump-sum

cash payments and purchasing annuity contracts for
participants to permanently extinguish the pension plan’s obligations. As a result, the Company recorded a $46 million charge to other expense, which consisted of a $6 million cash contribution to the plan and a $40 million

non-cash

charge related to the reversal of unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity. The $46 million

pre-tax

charge reduced net income per diluted share by $0.39. The termination of the Waters Retirement Restoration Plan is expected to be completed in 2019.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company also sponsors other employee benefit plans in the U.S., including a retiree
healthcare plan, which provides reimbursement for medical expenses and is contributory. There are various employee benefit plans outside the United States (both defined benefit and defined contribution plans). Certain

non-U.S.

defined benefit plans

(“Non-U.S.

Pension Plans”) are included in the disclosures below, which are required under the accounting standards for
retirement benefits.

The Company contributed $13 million, $12 million and $12 million in the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, to the

non-U.S.

plans (primarily defined contribution plans) which are currently outside of the scope of the required disclosures. The eligibility and
vesting of

non-U.S. plans

are consistent with local laws and regulations.

The
net periodic pension cost is made up of several components that reflect different aspects of the Company’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits earned by employees. These components are determined using the projected unit
credit actuarial cost method and are based on certain actuarial assumptions. The Company’s accounting policy is to reflect in the projected benefit obligation all benefit changes to which the Company is committed as of the current valuation
date; use a market-related value of assets to determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the expected future service of active participants as of the date such costs are first recognized; and
amortize cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation over the expected future service of active participants.

portfolios and of appropriate market indexes and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations of the plan. Within the equity portfolio of the U.S. Retiree Healthcare Plan,
investments are diversified among market capitalization and investment strategy, and targets a 20% allocation of the equity portfolio to be invested in financial markets outside of the United States. The Company does not invest in its own stock
within the U.S. Retiree Healthcare Plan’s assets.

Plan assets are measured at fair value using the following
valuation techniques and inputs:

Level 1:

The fair value of these types of investments is based on market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges.

Level 2:

The fair value of these types of investments utilizes data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.

Level 3:

These bank and insurance investment contracts are issued by well-known, highly-rated companies. The fair value disclosed represents the present value of future cash flows under the
terms of the respective contracts. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of these contracts include the amount and timing of future cash flows and counterparty credit risk.

There have been no changes in the above valuation techniques associated with determining the value
of the plans’ assets during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered historical returns and future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset
allocation of the pension portfolio and historical expenses paid by the plan. A

one-quarter

percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate of return on assets would decrease the Company’s net
periodic benefit cost by less than $1 million. A

one-quarter

percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost by less than $1 million.

17    Business Segment Information

The accounting standards for segment reporting establish standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual
financial statements and require selected information for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports of public business enterprises. They also establish standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas
and major customers. The Company’s business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined
that it has two operating segments: Waters

TM

and TA

TM

.

The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments,
columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis,
rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments.
Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of
the Company.

The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing
habits for capital goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. Selling and administrative expenses are typically higher after the first quarter in each year as the Company’s annual payroll merit
increases take effect. Selling and administrative expenses will vary in the fourth quarter in relation to performance in the quarter and for the year. In the first quarter of 2018 and third quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $1 million and
$4 million of stock compensation expenses, respectively, in selling and administrative expenses related to the modification of certain stock awards upon the retirement of senior executives.

In the second quarter of 2017, the Company incurred a $10 million litigation provision related to the issuance of a verdict in a
patent litigation case. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company resolved the case with a final settlement that resulted in a gain of $2 million (see Note 11). In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $5 million charge
related to acquired

in-process

research and development (see Note 2). In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company settled a pension plan obligation and recorded a $46 million charge, which consisted of a
$6 million cash contribution to the plan and a $40 million

non-cash

charge related to the reversal of unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
stockholders’ equity (see Note 16). In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $550 million income tax provision as a result of the 2017 Tax Act (see Note 10).



Item 9:

None.

Item 9A:

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
this annual report on Form

10-K.

Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of December 31, 2018 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

PART III

Item 10:

Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance

Information regarding the Company’s directors and any material changes to the process by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Board
of Directors is contained in the definitive proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders under the headings “Election of Directors”, “Directors Meetings and Board Committees”, “Corporate Governance”,
“Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors” and “Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers”. Information regarding compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act is contained in the Company’s
definitive proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders under the heading “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance”. Information regarding the Company’s Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial
Expert is contained in the definitive proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders under the headings “Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors” and “Directors Meetings and Board Committees”. Such
information is incorporated herein by reference. Information regarding the Company’s executive officers is contained in Part I of this

Form 10-K.

The Company has adopted a Global Code of Business Conduct & Ethics (the “Code”) that applies to all of the
Company’s employees (including its executive officers) and directors and that is in compliance with Item 406 of Regulation

S-K.

The Code has been distributed to all employees of the Company. In addition,
the Code is available on the Company’s website,

www.waters.com

, under the caption “Corporate Governance”. The Company intends to satisfy the disclosure requirement regarding any amendment to, or waiver of a provision of, the
Code applicable to any executive officer or director by posting such information on its website. The Company shall also provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of the Code. Any such request must be made in writing to the Secretary
of the Company, c/o Waters Corporation, 34 Maple Street, Milford, MA 01757.

The Company’s corporate governance
guidelines and the charters of the audit committee, compensation committee, finance committee and nominating and corporate governance committee of the Board of Directors are available on the Company’s website,

Corporation, 34 Maple Street, Milford, MA 01757.

In 2017, the Company adopted a proxy access bylaw provision that allows
eligible stockholders or groups of up to 20 stockholders who have held at least 3% of the Company’s common stock continuously for three years to nominate up to two individuals or 20% of the Board of Directors, whichever is greater, for election
at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and to have those individuals included in the Company’s proxy materials for that meeting. The Company believes that the proxy access bylaw adopted by the Company strikes an appropriate
balance between providing meaningful proxy access for stockholders and limiting the potential for abuse.

These amounts have been recorded as part of the income statement provision for income taxes. The income statement effects of these amounts
have largely been offset by amounts related to changes in other deferred tax balance sheet accounts.

**

The change in the valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to the

write-off

of a valuation allowance to Retained Earnings for the tax effect related to intra-entity asset transfers. The change in the valuation allowance during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016
is primarily due to the effect of foreign currency translation on a valuation allowance related to a net operating loss carryforward. In addition, 2016 includes the release of a valuation allowance related to a foreign tax credit carryforward due to
expiration.
