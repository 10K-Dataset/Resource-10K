PART I

Item 1:

Business

General

Waters Corporation (“Waters” or the
    “Company”), an analytical instrument manufacturer,
    primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its
    Waters Division, high performance liquid chromatography
    (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography
    (“UPLC

®

”

    and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass
    spectrometry (“MS”) instrument systems and support
    products, including chromatography columns, other consumable
    products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These
    systems are complementary products that can be integrated
    together and used along with other analytical instruments.
    Through its TA Division
    (“TA

®

”),

    the Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services
    thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The
    Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based
    products that interface with the Company’s instruments as
    well as other manufacturers’ instruments.

The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, life
    science, biochemical, industrial, academic and government
    customers working in research and development, quality assurance
    and other laboratory applications. The Company’s LC and MS
    instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to
    detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and
    biological composition of materials, as well as to purify a full
    range of compounds. These instruments are used in drug discovery
    and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis
    of proteins in disease processes (known as
    “proteomics”), food safety analysis and environmental
    testing. The Company’s thermal analysis, rheometry and
    calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability
    of fine chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids for uses in
    various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as
    well as for life science research.

Waters is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding
    common stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating
    subsidiary. Waters became a publicly traded company with its
    initial public offering (“IPO”) in November 1995.
    Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and
    complementary technologies to its range of products with the
    acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited
    (“Micromass

®

”)

    in September 1997.

Business
    Segments

The Company’s business activities, for which financial
    information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated
    by the chief operating decision makers. As a result of this
    evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating
    segments: Waters Division and TA Division. As indicated above,
    the Company operates in the analytical instruments industry,
    designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing products in
    three technologies: LC and MS instruments; columns and other
    consumables; and thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry
    instruments. The Company’s two operating segments, Waters
    Division and TA Division, have similar economic characteristics;
    product processes; products and services; types and classes of
    customers; methods of distribution and regulatory environments.
    Because of these similarities, the two segments have been
    aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement
    purposes.

Information concerning revenues and long-lived assets
    attributable to each of the Company’s products, services
    and geographic areas is set forth in Note 16 in the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated
    herein by reference.

Waters
    Division

High
    Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid
    Chromatography

Developed in the 1950’s, HPLC is the standard technique
    used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a
    variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes
    that HPLC’s performance capabilities enable it to separate
    and identify approximately 80% of all known chemicals and
    materials. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a
    wide variety of industries for research and development
    purposes, quality control and process engineering applications.



The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served
    by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these
    markets, HPLC is used extensively to identify new drugs, develop
    manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new
    pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other
    applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for
    nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations, the
    testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing
    industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as
    chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by
    universities, research institutions and government agencies,
    such as the United States Food and Drug Administration
    (“FDA”) and the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency (“EPA”) and their international counterparts
    who mandate testing requiring HPLC instrumentation.

Traditionally, a typical HPLC system has consisted of five basic
    components: solvent delivery system, sample injector, separation
    column, detector and data acquisition unit. The solvent delivery
    system pumps solvents through the HPLC system, while the sample
    injector introduces samples into the solvent flow. The
    chromatography column then separates the sample into its
    components for analysis by the detector, which measures the
    presence and amount of the constituents. The data acquisition
    unit, usually referred to as the instrument’s software or
    data system, then records and stores the information from the
    detector.

In 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company
    describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that
    utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter
    particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY
    UPLC

®

,

    to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic
    bands that are generated by these small particles. By using the
    ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more
    comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in
    comparison with many analyses performed by HPLC. In addition, in
    using ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the
    range of applications beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to
    uncover new levels of scientific information. Though it offers
    significant performance advantages, ACQUITY UPLC is compatible
    with the Company’s software products and the general
    operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the
    Company’s customers and field sales and support
    organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology
    and instrument. The Company began shipping the ACQUITY UPLC in
    the third quarter of 2004. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company experienced growth in the LC instrument system product
    line primarily from the sales of ACQUITY UPLC systems.

Waters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in
    configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation,
    from component configured systems for academic research
    applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing,
    and that have a variety of detection technologies, from
    ultra-violet (“UV”) absorbance to MS, optimized for
    certain analyses. The Company also manufactures tailored LC
    systems for the analysis of biologics, as well as an LC detector
    utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the
    usage of LC to compounds that are not amenable to UV absorbance
    detection.

The primary consumable products for LC are chromatography
    columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in
    the LC testing process and are replaced at regular intervals.
    The chromatography column contains one of several types of
    packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from
    silica. As the sample flows through the column, it is separated
    into its constituent components.

Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and
    competitors’ LC systems. The Company believes that it is
    one of the few suppliers in the world that processes silica,
    packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the
    Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key
    attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and
    react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company believes
    that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used nearly
    exclusively on its ACQUITY UPLC instrument and, furthermore,
    that its ACQUITY UPLC instrument primarily uses ACQUITY UPLC
    columns. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, excluding the small impact from
    acquisitions mentioned below, the Company experienced growth in
    its LC chromatography column and sample preparation businesses,
    especially in ACQUITY UPLC columns.

In February 2009, the Company acquired all of the remaining
    outstanding capital stock of Thar Instruments, Inc.
    (“Thar”), a privately-held global leader in the
    design, development and manufacture of analytical and
    preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical
    fluid extraction (“SFC”) systems, for $36 million
    in cash, including the assumption of $4 million of debt. In
    December 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of Analytical
    Products Group, Inc. (“APG”), a provider of
    environmental testing products for quality control and
    proficiency testing used in environmental laboratories, for
    $5 million in cash. The APG business has been integrated



into the Company’s Environmental Resources Associates, Inc.
    (“ERA”) business, which was acquired in December 2006.
    The Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
    ERA, a provider of environmental testing products for quality
    control, proficiency testing and specialty calibration chemicals
    used in environmental laboratories, for $62 million in
    cash, including the assumption of $4 million of debt. ERA
    also provides product support services required to help
    laboratories with their federal and state mandated accreditation
    requirements or with quality control over critical
    pharmaceutical analysis. In February 2006, the Company acquired
    the net assets of the food safety business of
    VICAM

®

Limited Partnership (“VICAM”) for $14 million in
    cash. VICAM is a leading provider of tests to identify and
    quantify mycotoxins in various agricultural commodities. The
    Company’s test kits provide reliable, quantitative
    detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of
    flurometer, LC-MS or HPLC. The APG, ERA and VICAM acquisitions
    are part of the chemistry consumable product line.

Based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and
    publicly disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company
    believes that it is one of the world’s largest
    manufacturers and distributors of LC instruments, chromatography
    columns and other consumables and related services. The Company
    also believes that it has the leading LC market share in the
    United States, Europe and Asia, and believes it has a leading
    market share position in Japan.

Mass
    Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is
    used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials
    and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of
    molecules by measuring the masses of individual molecules that
    have been converted into ions.

The Company believes it is a market leader in the development,
    manufacture, sale and distribution of MS instruments. These
    instruments can be integrated and used along with other
    complementary analytical instruments and systems, such as LC,
    chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis
    chromatography and gas chromatography. A wide variety of
    instrumental designs fall within the overall category of MS
    instrumentation, including devices that incorporate quadrupole,
    ion trap,

time-of-flight

(“Tof”) and classical magnetic sector technologies.
    Furthermore, these technologies are often used in tandem to
    maximize the efficacy of certain experiments.

Currently, the Company offers a wide range of MS instruments
    utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof, ion mobility
    and magnetic sector designs. These instruments are used in drug
    discovery and development, as well as for environmental and food
    safety testing. The majority of mass spectrometers sold by the
    Company are designed to utilize an LC system as the sample
    introduction device. These products supply a diverse market with
    a strong emphasis on the life science, pharmaceutical,
    biomedical, clinical, food and environmental market segments
    worldwide.

The mass spectrometer is an increasingly important detection
    device for LC. The Company’s smaller-sized mass
    spectrometers (such as the SQD and the TQD) are often referred
    to as LC “detectors” and are either sold as part of an
    LC system or as an LC system upgrade. Larger quadrupole systems,
    such as the
    Xevo

tm

TQ and Quattro
    Premier

tm

XE instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for
    late-stage drug development, including clinical trial testing,
    and quadrupole

time-of-flight

(“Q-Tof

tm

”)

    instruments, such as the Company’s
    Synapt

tm

MS, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease
    processes, an application sometimes referred to as
    “proteomics”. In 2006, the Company introduced the
    tandem quadrupole device, the TQD, and a new hybrid

Q-Tof

technology system, the
    Synapt

tm

HDMS

tm

.

    The Synapt HDMS system integrates ion mobility technology within
    a Q-Tof geometry instrument configuration and uniquely allows
    researchers to glean molecular shape information, a novel
    capability for a mass spectrometry instrument. In 2008, the
    Company introduced a new Q-Tof instrument called the Synapt MS.
    This instrument is an improved version of the Q-Tof
    Premier

tm

that customers may opt to upgrade to Synapt HDMS capability. In
    late 2008, the
    Xevo

tm

QTof

tm

MS, an exact mass MS/MS bench-top instrument, was introduced. In
    late 2009, the Company introduced the
    Synapt

tm

G2 HDMS

tm

system. The Synapt G2 HDMS and
    Synapt

tm

G2 MS systems are high resolution exact mass MS/MS platforms
    that are performance enhanced replacements for the Synapt HDMS
    and Synapt MS systems. The performance enhancements offered by
    these new systems allow for higher resolution shape
    discrimination by the HDMS version and superior mass resolution,
    mass accuracy and quantification accuracy by both versions.



LC-MS

LC and MS are instrumental technologies often embodied within an
    analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of
    analyses or as a general purpose analytical device. An
    increasing percentage of the Company’s customers are
    purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it is
    becoming common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within
    the same laboratory and operated by the same user. The
    descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical
    segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical
    categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly
    in today’s instrument market, this segmentation and
    categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of
    instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS
    technologies as part of a single device. In response to this
    development and to further promote the high utilization of these
    hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters
    Division to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated
    LC-MS systems.

Waters
    Division Service

The servicing and support of LC and MS instruments and
    accessories is an important source of revenue for the Waters
    Division. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale
    of support plans, demand service, customer training and
    performance validation services. Support plans most typically
    involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to
    promptly repair a non-functioning instrument in return for a fee
    described in a contract that is priced according to the
    configuration of the instrument.

TA
    Division

Thermal
    Analysis, Rheometry and Calorimetry

Thermal analysis measures the physical characteristics of
    materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature
    affect several characteristics of materials, such as their
    physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical
    properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal
    analysis techniques, including calorimetry. Consequently,
    thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development,
    production and characterization of materials in various
    industries, such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles,
    pharmaceuticals and electronics.

Rheometry instruments complement thermal analyzers in
    characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow
    properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity
    and deformation under different types of “loading” or
    conditions. The information obtained under such conditions
    provides insight into a material’s behavior during
    manufacturing, transport, usage and storage.

Thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are heavily used in
    material testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide
    information useful in predicting the suitability of fine
    chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial,
    consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life
    science research. As with systems offered through the Waters
    Division, a range of instrumental configurations are available
    with increasing levels of sample handling and information
    processing automation. In addition, systems and accompanying
    software packages can be tailored for specific applications. For
    example, the
    Q-Series

tm

family of differential scanning calorimeters includes a range of
    instruments, from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive
    systems that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a
    variety of sample cells and temperature control features for
    analyzing a broad range of materials. In 2009, TA introduced the
    ARIES G2 rheometer, a high performance system uniquely capable
    of independently measuring stress and strain for a wide variety
    of solids and liquids.

In July 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of VTI
    Corporation (“VTI”), a manufacturer of sorption
    analysis and thermogravimetric analysis instruments, for
    $3 million in cash. VTI’s products are widely used in
    the evaluation of pharmaceuticals, catalysts and energy-related
    materials. This acquisition added two technologies which
    complement TA’s existing gravimetric analysis product line.
    VTI’s sorption analysis products are designed for water and
    organic vapor sorption studies of pharmaceuticals and related
    materials. VTI’s high pressure, high vacuum TGA projects
    are designed for high pressure sorption studies, which are
    commonly used in the analysis of energy-related materials.

In August 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Calorimetry Sciences Corporation
    (“CSC”), a privately-held company that designs,
    develops and manufactures highly sensitive



calorimeters, for $7 million in cash, including the
    assumption of $1 million of liabilities. CSC products and
    services are primarily used in the life sciences industry. This
    acquisition added two systems which complement TA’s
    existing TAM micro-calorimeter product line. The Nano-ITC is an
    isothermal titration calorimeter designed to measure
    protein-ligand binding and the interaction of biological
    materials. The Nano-DSC is an ultra-sensitive scanning
    calorimeter used to measure the stability of proteins and other
    macromolecules in dilute solutions and is commonly used in
    pharmaceutical development processes.

In August 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Thermometric AB (“Thermometric”), a
    manufacturer of high performance micro-calorimeters, for
    $3 million in cash, including the assumption of
    $1 million of debt. Thermometric’s flagship product,
    the TAM III, is a modular calorimeter that employs proprietary
    technology to deliver calorimetric sensitivity and temperature
    stability. It is used to characterize materials and their
    interactions in the fields of pharmaceuticals, life and
    materials sciences. The TAM III systems complement TA’s
    industry leading Q-Series differential scanning calorimeter
    product line and the CSC product lines acquired in 2007.
    Thermometric’s manufacturing and research and development
    were moved and consolidated with CSC late in 2008.

TA
    Service

The Company sells, supports and services TA Division’s
    product offerings through its headquarters in New Castle,
    Delaware. TA operates independently from the Waters Division,
    though several of its overseas offices are situated in
    Waters’ facilities. TA has dedicated field sales and
    service operations. Service sales are primarily derived from the
    sale of replacement parts and from billed labor fees associated
    with the repair, maintenance and upgrade of installed systems.

Customers

The Company has a broad and diversified customer base that
    includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts,
    universities and government agencies. The pharmaceutical segment
    represents the Company’s largest sector and includes
    multinational pharmaceutical companies, generic drug
    manufacturers, contract research organizations (CROs) and
    biotechnology companies. The Company’s other industrial
    customers include chemical manufacturers, polymer manufacturers,
    food and beverage companies and environmental testing
    laboratories. The Company also sells to various universities and
    government agencies worldwide. The Company’s technical
    support staff works closely with its customers in developing and
    implementing applications that meet their full range of
    analytical requirements.

The Company does not rely on any single customer or one group of
    customers for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal
    years 2009, 2008 and 2007, no single customer accounted for more
    than 3% of the Company’s net sales.

Sales and
    Service

The Company has one of the largest sales and service
    organizations in the industry, focused exclusively on the
    various instrument systems’ installed base. Across these
    product technologies, using respective specialized sales and
    service forces, the Company serves its customer base with
    approximately 2,700 field representatives in 92 sales offices
    throughout the world as of December 31, 2009. The
    Company’s sales representatives have direct responsibility
    for account relationships, while service representatives work in
    the field to install instruments, train and minimize instrument
    downtime for customers. In-house, technical support
    representatives work directly with customers providing them
    assistance with applications and procedures on Company products.
    The Company provides customers with comprehensive information
    through various corporate and regional internet websites and
    product literature, and also makes consumable products available
    through electronic ordering facilities and a dedicated catalog.

Manufacturing

The Company provides high quality LC products by overseeing each
    stage of the production of its instruments, columns and chemical
    reagents. The Company currently assembles a portion of its LC
    instruments at its facility in



Milford, Massachusetts, where it performs machining, assembly
    and testing. The Milford facility maintains a quality management
    system in accordance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2000, ISO
    13485:2003, ISO 14001:2004 and applicable regulatory
    requirements (including FDA Quality System Regulations and the
    European In-Vitro Diagnostics Directives). The Company
    outsources manufacturing of certain electronic components, such
    as computers, monitors and circuit boards, to outside vendors
    that can meet the Company’s quality requirements. In 2006,
    the Company transitioned the manufacturing of LC instrument
    systems and components to a well-established contract
    manufacturing firm in Singapore. The Company expects to continue
    pursuing outsourcing opportunities.

The Company manufactures its LC columns at its facilities in
    Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland, where it processes,
    sizes and treats silica and polymeric media that are packed into
    columns, solid phase extraction cartridges and bulk shipping
    containers. The Wexford facility also manufactures and
    distributes certain data, instruments and software components
    for the Company’s LC, MS and TA Division product lines.
    These facilities meet similar ISO and FDA standards met by the
    Milford, Massachusetts facility and are registered with the FDA.
    VICAM manufactures antibody resin and magnetic beads that are
    packed into columns and kits in Milford, Massachusetts and Nixa,
    Missouri. ERA manufactures environmental proficiency kits in
    Arvada, Colorado. Thar manufactures SFC systems in Pittsburgh,
    Pennsylvania.

The Company manufactures most of its MS products at its
    facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire, England and
    Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the
    Company’s MS instruments are manufactured by long-standing
    outside contractors. Each stage of this supply chain is closely
    monitored by the Company to maintain high quality and
    performance standards. The instruments, components or modules
    are then returned to the Company’s facilities where its
    engineers perform final assembly, calibrations to customer
    specifications and quality control procedures. The
    Company’s MS facilities meet similar ISO and FDA standards
    met by the Milford, Massachusetts facility and are registered
    with the FDA.

Thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry products are
    manufactured by TA. Thermal analysis products are manufactured
    at the Company’s New Castle, Delaware facility. Rheometry
    products are manufactured at the Company’s New Castle,
    Delaware and Crawley, England facilities. Microcalorimetry
    products are manufactured at the Company’s Lindon, Utah
    facility. VTI manufactures sorption analysis and
    thermogravimetric analysis instruments in Hialeah, Florida.
    Similar to MS, elements of TA’s products are manufactured
    by outside contractors and are then returned to the
    Company’s facilities for final assembly, calibration and
    quality control. The Company’s thermal analysis facilities
    are certified to ISO 9001:2000 standards.

Research
    and Development

The Company maintains an active research and development program
    focused on the development and commercialization of products
    that both complement and update the existing product offering.
    The Company’s research and development expenditures for
    2009, 2008 and 2007 were $77 million, $82 million and
    $81 million, respectively. Nearly all of the current LC
    products of the Company have been developed at the
    Company’s main research and development center located in
    Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the
    Company’s extensive field organizations and customers. The
    majority of the MS products have been developed at facilities in
    England and nearly all of the current thermal analysis products
    have been developed at the Company’s research and
    development center in New Castle, Delaware. At December 31,
    2009, there were 677 employees involved in the
    Company’s research and development efforts. The Company has
    increased research and development expenses relating to
    acquisitions and the Company’s continued commitment to
    invest significantly in new product development and existing
    product enhancements. Despite the Company’s active research
    and development programs, there can be no assurances that the
    Company’s product development and commercialization efforts
    will be successful or that the products developed by the Company
    will be accepted by the marketplace.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 5,200 employees at
    December 31, 2009, with approximately 44% of the
    Company’s employees located in the United States. The
    Company believes its employee relations are generally good. The
    Company’s employees are not unionized or affiliated with
    any internal or external labor organizations.



The Company believes that its future success largely depends
    upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled
    employees.

Competition

The analytical instrument and systems market is highly
    competitive. The Company encounters competition from several
    worldwide instrument manufacturers and other companies in both
    domestic and foreign markets for each of its three technologies.
    The Company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of
    instrument performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser
    extent, price. Some competitors have instrument businesses that
    are generally more diversified than the Company’s business,
    but are typically less focused on the Company’s chosen
    markets. Some competitors have greater financial and other
    resources than the Company.

In the markets served by the Waters Division, the Company’s
    principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., Life
    Technologies Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Varian,
    Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Dionex Corporation and Bruker
    BioSciences. In 2009, Danaher Corporation announced an intention
    to acquire the mass spectrometry assets of Life Technologies
    Corporation and Agilent Technologies, Inc. announced plans to
    acquire Varian, Inc. In the markets served by the TA Division,
    the Company’s principal competitors include: PerkinElmer,
    Inc., Mettler-Toledo International Inc., NETZSCH-Geraetebau
    GmbH, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern Instruments Ltd.,
    Anton-Paar and General Electric Company.

The market for consumable LC products, including separation
    columns, is highly competitive and more fragmented than the
    analytical instruments market. The Company encounters
    competition in the consumable columns market from chemical
    companies that produce column chemicals and small specialized
    companies that pack and distribute columns. The Company believes
    that it is one of the few suppliers that process silica, packs
    columns and distributes its own product. The Company competes in
    this market on the basis of reproducibility, reputation,
    performance and, to a lesser extent, price. The Company’s
    principal competitors for consumable products include:
    Phenomenex, Inc., Supelco, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc.,
    General Electric Company, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and
    Merck and Co., Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to
    offer a predictable level of performance when used with ACQUITY
    UPLC columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the
    ACQUITY UPLC instrument base will enhance its chromatographic
    column business because of the high level of synergy between
    ACQUITY UPLC columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instrument. In 2009,
    Agilent Technologies, Inc. introduced a new LC system, which
    they termed a UHPLC, which they have claimed has similar
    performance characteristics to Waters’ ACQUITY UPLC.

Patents,
    Trademarks and Licenses

The Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents
    and has patent applications pending in the United States
    and abroad. Certain technology and software is licensed from
    third parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The
    Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as
    valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes
    that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is,
    in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss
    would materially affect the Company’s business as a whole.

Environmental
    Matters and Climate Change

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws,
    regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or
    operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as
    discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal
    practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose
    liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages
    resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases
    of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently
    conducts its operations and has operated its business in the
    past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental
    laws. From time to time, operations of the Company have resulted
    or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or
    liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The
    Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse
    effect on its operations, financial condition or competitive
    position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental
    laws.

The Company is sensitive to the growing global debate with
    respect to climate change. In the first quarter of 2009, the
    Company published its first sustainability report identifying
    the various actions and behaviors the



Company has adopted concerning its commitment to both the
    environment and the broader topic of social responsibility. An
    internal sustainability working group was formed and is
    functioning to develop increasingly robust data with respect to
    the Company’s utilization of carbon producing substances.
    See Item 1A, Risk Factors — Effects of Climate
    Change, for more information on the potential significance of
    climate change legislation.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the
    analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to
    the following risks.

Global
    Economic Conditions

The global economic conditions had an unfavorable impact on
    demand for the Company’s products in 2009 and in late 2008.
    These conditions resulted in a decline in demand for the
    Company’s products and services and may result in a decline
    in demand for the Company’s products and services in the
    near future. There can be no assurance that there will not be a
    further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in
    major economies. Any further deterioration or prolonged
    disruption in the financial markets or market conditions
    generally may result in reduced demand for the Company’s
    products and services. The Company’s global business may
    also be adversely affected by decreases in the general level of
    economic activity as a result of the economic and financial
    market situations.

Financial
    Market Conditions

Financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have experienced
    extreme disruption over the past few years, including, among
    other things, a sharp increase in the cost of new capital,
    severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced
    liquidity in money markets. Financial and banking institutions
    have also experienced disruptions, resulting in large asset
    write-downs, higher costs of capital, rating downgrades and
    reduced desire to lend money. While currently these conditions
    have not impacted the Company’s ability to access its
    existing cash or borrow on its existing revolving credit
    facility, there can be no assurance that there will not be
    further deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial
    markets or financial institutions. Any further deterioration or
    prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial
    institutions in which the Company participates may impair the
    Company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving
    credit facility and impair its ability to access sources of new
    capital. The Company’s cost of any new capital raised and
    interest expense would increase if this were to occur.

Customer
    Demand

The demand for the Company’s products is dependent upon the
    size of the markets for its LC, MS, thermal analysis, rheometry
    and calorimetry products; the timing and level of capital
    expenditures of the Company’s customers; changes in
    government regulations, particularly effecting drug, food and
    drinking water testing; funding available to academic and
    government institutions; general economic conditions and the
    rate of economic growth in the Company’s major markets; and
    competitive considerations. The Company typically experiences an
    increase in sales in its fourth quarter, as a result of
    purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to
    exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. There can
    be no assurances that the Company’s results of operations
    or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a
    change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of
    weakness in global economic conditions.

Additionally, the analytical instrument market may, from time to
    time, experience low sales growth. Approximately 51% and 50% of
    the Company’s net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively,
    were to the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    industries, which may be periodically subject to unfavorable
    market conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable industry
    conditions could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations or financial condition.



Competition
    and the Analytical Instrument Market

The analytical instrument market and, in particular, the portion
    related to the Company’s HPLC, UPLC, MS,

LC-MS,

thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines, is
    highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology.
    The Company encounters competition from several international
    instrument manufacturers and other companies in both domestic
    and foreign markets. Some competitors have instrument businesses
    that are generally more diversified than the Company’s
    business, but are typically less focused on the Company’s
    chosen markets. There can be no assurances that the
    Company’s competitors will not introduce more effective and
    less costly products than those of the Company or that the
    Company will be able to increase its sales and profitability
    from new product introductions. There can be no assurances that
    the Company’s sales and marketing forces will compete
    successfully against its competitors in the future.

Levels of
    Debt and Debt Service Requirements

The Company had approximately $632 million in debt and
    $630 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments as of December 31, 2009. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company also had the ability to
    borrow an additional $479 million from its existing credit
    facilities. Most of the Company’s debt is in the
    U.S. There is a substantial cash requirement in the
    U.S. to fund operations and capital expenditures, service
    debt interest obligations, finance potential acquisitions and
    continue authorized stock repurchase programs. A majority of the
    Company’s cash is maintained and generated from foreign
    operations. The Company’s financial condition and results
    of operations could be adversely impacted if the Company is
    unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the
    U.S. to address these requirements through cash from
    U.S. operations, efficient and timely repatriation of cash
    from overseas, the Company’s ability to access its existing
    cash and revolving credit facility and other sources obtained at
    an acceptable cost.

Debt
    Covenants

The Company’s debt may become subject to restrictive
    covenants that limit the Company’s ability to engage in
    certain activities that could otherwise benefit the Company.
    These debt covenants include restrictions on the Company’s
    ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements that may
    limit the Company’s ability to make dividend or other
    payments; secure other indebtedness; enter into transactions
    with affiliates and consolidate, merge or transfer all or
    substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Company is
    also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms
    of the Company’s debt agreements. The Company’s
    ability to comply with these financial restrictions and
    covenants is dependent on the Company’s future performance,
    which is subject to, but not limited to, prevailing economic
    conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond
    the Company’s control, such as foreign exchange rates,
    interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level
    of competition.

Risk of
    Disruption of Operations

The Company manufactures LC instruments at facilities in
    Milford, Massachusetts and Singapore; chemistry separation
    columns at its facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford,
    Ireland; MS products at its facilities in Manchester, England,
    Cheshire, England and Wexford, Ireland; thermal analysis
    products at its facility in New Castle, Delaware; rheometry
    products at its facilities in New Castle, Delaware and Crawley,
    England and other instruments and consumables at various other
    locations as a result of the Company’s recent acquisitions.
    Any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these
    facilities, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or
    damage to any facility or other reasons, could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or
    financial condition.

Sovereign
    Risk, Foreign Operations and Exchange Rates

Approximately 69% and 70% of the Company’s net sales in
    2009 and 2008, respectively, were outside of the
    United States and were primarily denominated in foreign
    currencies. In addition, the Company has considerable
    manufacturing operations in Ireland, the United Kingdom and
    Singapore. As a result, a significant portion of the
    Company’s sales and operations are subject to certain
    risks, including adverse developments in the foreign political
    and economic environment; sudden movements in a country’s
    foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s
    sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices;
    tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in staffing and
    managing foreign operations; and potentially adverse tax
    consequences.



Additionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s
    net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses, interest, taxes
    and net income varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
    Significant increases or decreases in the value of the
    U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could
    have a material adverse effect or benefit on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial condition.

Reliance
    on Key Management

The operation of the Company requires managerial and operational
    expertise. None of the key management employees have an
    employment contract with the Company and there can be no
    assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company.
    If, for any reason, such key personnel do not continue to be
    active in management, the Company’s results of operations
    or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Protection
    of Intellectual Property

The Company vigorously protects its intellectual property rights
    and seeks patent coverage on all developments that it regards as
    material and patentable. However, there can be no assurances
    that any patents held by the Company will not be challenged,
    invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted
    thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company.
    Conversely, there could be successful claims against the Company
    by third-party patent holders with respect to certain Company
    products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of
    such third parties. The Company’s patents, including those
    licensed from others, expire on various dates. If the Company is
    unable to protect its intellectual property rights, it could
    have an adverse and material effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial condition.

Reliance
    on Suppliers

Most of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by
    the Company are available from a number of different suppliers;
    however, a number of items are purchased from limited or single
    sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have a
    temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results
    of the Company. The Company believes alternative sources could
    ordinarily be obtained to supply these materials, but a
    prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components
    could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition or results of operations and could result in damage to
    its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely
    affect the Company’s business.

Use of
    Outside Manufacturers

Certain components or modules of the Company’s LC and MS
    instruments are manufactured by long-standing outside
    contractors. Since 2006, the Company has transitioned the
    manufacturing of LC instrument systems and related components to
    a well-established contract manufacturing firm in Singapore.
    Disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have
    an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results
    of the Company. The Company believes that it could obtain
    alternative sources for these components or modules, but a
    prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could
    have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition
    or results of operations.

Risk in
    Unexpected Shifts in Taxable Income between Tax
    Jurisdictions

The Company is subject to a range of income tax rates, from 0%
    to in excess of 35%, depending on specific tax jurisdictions
    around the world. The Company typically generates a substantial
    portion of its taxable income in the fourth quarter of each
    fiscal year. Shifts in actual taxable income from previous
    quarters’ projections due to factors, including, but not
    limited to, changes in volume and foreign currency translation
    rates, could have a notable favorable or unfavorable effect on
    the Company’s income tax expense and results of operations.

Effects
    of Climate Change

The Company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its
    products involve the use of chemical and other substances that
    are regulated under various international, federal, state and
    local laws governing the environment. In the event that any
    future climate change legislation would require that stricter
    standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental
    regulatory authorities with respect to the use

and/or

levels of possible emissions from such chemicals

and/or

other
    substances, the Company may be required to make certain changes
    and adaptations to



its manufacturing processes. There can be no assurance that any
    such changes would not have a material effect on the financial
    statements of the Company.

Another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the
    severity of global weather conditions. The Company manufactures
    a growing percentage of its HPLC, UPLC and MS products in both
    Singapore and Wexford, Ireland. Although the Company believes
    its has an adequate disaster recovery plan in place, severe
    weather conditions, including earthquakes, hurricanes

and/or

tsunami, could potentially cause significant damage to the
    Company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these
    countries. There can be no assurance that the effects of such
    damage and the resultant disruption of manufacturing operations
    would not have a materially adverse impact to the financial
    results of the Company.

Regulatory
    Compliance

The Company is subject to regulation by various federal, state
    and foreign governments and agencies in areas including, among
    others, health and safety, import/export and environmental. A
    portion of the Company’s operations are subject to
    regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and
    similar foreign agencies. These regulations are complex and
    govern an array of product activities, including design,
    development, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and
    distribution. Any failure by the Company to comply with
    applicable government regulations could result in product
    recalls, the imposition of fines, restrictions on the
    Company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or
    the cessation of all or a portion of its operations.

Some of the Company’s operations are subject to domestic
    and international laws and regulations with respect to the
    manufacture, handling, use or sale of toxic or hazardous
    substances. This requires the Company to devote substantial
    resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and
    regulations. If the Company fails to comply with such
    requirements in the manufacture or distribution of its products,
    it could face civil

and/or

criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from
    distributing or selling such products until they are compliant.

Some of the Company’s products are also subject to the
    rules of certain industrial standards bodies, such as the
    International Standards Organization. The Company must comply
    with these rules, as well as those of other agencies such as
    those of the United States Occupational Health and Safety
    Administration. Failure to comply with such rules could result
    in the loss of certification

and/or

the
    imposition of fines and penalties which could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s operations.

Item 3:

Legal
    Proceedings

Agilent
    Technologies, Inc.

The Company filed suit in the United States against
    Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH (collectively,
    “HP”), seeking a declaration that certain products
    sold under the mark “Alliance” did not constitute an
    infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or its foreign
    subsidiaries (the “HP patents”). The action in the
    United States was dismissed for lack of controversy. Actions
    seeking revocation or nullification of foreign HP patents
    were filed by the Company in Germany, France and England. A
    German patent tribunal found the HP German patent to be
    valid. In Germany, France and England, HP and its successor,
    Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH (“Agilent”),
    brought actions alleging that certain features of the Alliance
    pump may infringe the HP patents. In England, the Court of
    Appeal found the HP patent valid and infringed. The
    Company’s petitions for leave to appeal to the House of
    Lords were denied. A trial on damages was scheduled for November
    2004.

In March 2004, Agilent brought a new action against the Company
    alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump continued to
    infringe the HP patents. In December 2004, following a trial in
    the new action, the UK court ruled that the Company did not
    infringe the HP patents. Agilent filed an appeal in that action,
    which was heard in July 2005, and the UK Appellate Court upheld
    the lower court’s ruling of non-infringement. In December
    2005, a trial on damages commenced in the first action and
    continued for six days prior to a holiday recess. In February
    2006, the Company, HP and Agilent entered into a settlement
    agreement (the “Agilent Settlement Agreement”) with
    respect to the first action and a consent order dismissing the
    case was entered. The Agilent Settlement Agreement provides for
    the release of the Company and its UK affiliate from each and
    every claim under Agilent’s European patent (UK) number
    309,596 arising out of the prior sale by either of them of
    Alliance Separations Modules incorporating the patented
    technology. In consideration of entering into the Agilent
    Settlement Agreement and the consent order, the Company made a
    payment to Agilent of 3.5 million British Pounds, in full
    and final settlement of Agilent’s claim for damages and in
    relation to all claims for costs and interest in the case.

In France, the Paris District Court found the HP patent valid
    and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company appealed the
    French decision and, in April 2004, the French appeals court
    affirmed the Paris District Court’s finding of
    infringement. The Company filed a further appeal in the case and
    the appeal was dismissed in March 2007. In January 2009, the
    French appeals court affirmed that the Company had infringed the
    Agilent patent and a judgment was issued against the Company.
    The Company has appealed this judgment. In the meantime,
    however, the Company recorded a $7 million provision in
    2008 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection
    with this case. The accrued patent litigation expense is in
    other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2009. In addition, the Company sought a
    declaration from the French court that, as was found in both the
    UK and Germany, certain modified features of the Alliance pump
    do not infringe the HP patents. A hearing on this matter was
    held in September 2007 and, in December 2007, the French court
    held that the modified features of the Alliance pump are
    non-infringing. Agilent appealed this ruling and, in January
    2010, the French appeals court affirmed the finding of
    non-infringement with respect to the modified features of the
    Alliance pump.

In the German case, a German court found the patent infringed.
    The Company appealed the German decision and, in December 2004,
    the German appeals court reversed the trial court and issued a
    finding of non-infringement in favor of the Company. Agilent
    sought an appeal in that action and the appeal was heard in
    April 2007. Following the hearing, the German Federal Court of
    Justice set aside the judgment of the appeals court and remanded
    the case back to the appeals court for further proceedings. In
    2008, the appeals court found the patent infringed. The Company
    has appealed this finding to the German Federal Court of
    Justice. In July 2005, Agilent brought a new action against the
    Company alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump
    continued to infringe the HP patents. In August 2006, following
    a trial in this new action, the German court ruled that the
    Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent filed an appeal
    in this action. A hearing on this appeal was held in January
    2008. The appeals court affirmed the finding of the trial court
    that the Company did not infringe. Agilent has appealed this
    finding to the German Federal Court of Justice.

The Company recorded provisions in 2004, 2005 and 2008 for
    estimated damages, legal fees and court costs to be incurred
    with respect to this ongoing litigation. The provisions
    represent management’s best estimate of the probable and
    reasonably estimable loss related to the litigations.



City of
    Dearborn Heights

In November 2008, the City of Dearborn Heights Act 345
    Police & Fire Retirement System filed a purported
    federal securities class action against the Company, Douglas
    Berthiaume and John Ornell in the United States District Court
    for the District of Massachusetts. In January 2009, Inter-Local
    Pension Fund GCC/IBT filed a motion to be appointed as lead
    plaintiff, which was granted. In April 2009, plaintiff filed an
    amended complaint that alleges that between July 24, 2007
    and January 22, 2008, the Company misrepresented or omitted
    material information about its projected annual revenues and
    earnings, its projected effective annual tax rate and the level
    of business activity in Japan. The action is purportedly brought
    on behalf of persons who purchased common stock of the Company
    between July 24, 2007 and January 22, 2008. The
    amended complaint seeks to recover under Section 10(b) of
    the Exchange Act,

Rule 10b-5

thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The
    Company, Mr. Berthiaume and Mr. Ornell have filed a
    motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which lead plaintiff
    opposed. The court has not yet indicated if it will hold oral
    argument on the pending motion. The Company intends to defend
    vigorously.

    entitled “Selected Financial Data” and is incorporated

    Item 6.

Item 7:

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Business
    and Financial Overview

The Company’s sales were $1,499 million,
    $1,575 million and $1,473 million in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Sales declined 5% in 2009 as compared with
    2008 and sales grew by 7% in 2008 as compared with 2007.
    Overall,



the 2009 decline in sales is primarily due to lower instrument
    spending by the Company’s customers as a result of global
    economic recessionary conditions and, to a lesser extent, due to
    the effect of foreign currency translation, which lowered sales
    by 2% in 2009. Companies acquired in late 2008 and early 2009
    added 2% to sales in 2009 as compared to 2008. 2009 instrument
    system sales declined 10% while recurring sales of chemistry
    consumables and service increased 2% as compared with 2008,
    primarily from the effect of acquisitions. The 2008 sales growth
    as compared to 2007 was primarily attributed to the
    Company’s introduction of new products, the increase in
    chemistry consumable and service sales and the effects of
    foreign currency translation.

A decline in sales, as compared to the corresponding quarter in
    the prior year, started in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the
    global economic recession and continued into the first three
    quarters of 2009. This decline ended in the fourth quarter of
    2009 when sales increased at a rate of 3% over the 2008 fourth
    quarter. The increase in the 2009 fourth quarter sales is
    attributed to favorable currency translation, the benefit from
    acquisitions, a slight improvement in global economic conditions
    and the introduction of new products.

During 2009, as compared to 2008, sales increased 1% in Asia
    (including Japan) while sales decreased 4% in the U.S., 9% in
    Europe and 12% in the rest of the world. The effect of currency
    translation decreased 2009 sales by 2%. During 2008, as compared
    to 2007, sales increased 1% in the U.S., 7% in Europe, 16% in
    Asia and 3% in the rest of the world. The effect of currency
    translation benefited 2008 sales by approximately 2%.

In 2009, as compared to 2008, sales to pharmaceutical and
    industrial and food safety customers decreased 4% and 11%,
    respectively. These decreases are primarily a result of reduced
    spending on instrument systems caused by the global economic
    recession and, to a lesser extent, the strengthening of the
    U.S. dollar in developing economies, including India, South
    America and Eastern Europe. Global sales to government and
    academic customers were 5% higher in 2009 and the increase can
    be primarily attributed to sales of the newly introduced mass
    spectrometry instrument systems, higher ACQUITY
    UPLC

®

instrument system sales and global governmental stimulus
    spending programs. In 2008, as compared to 2007, global sales to
    pharmaceutical, industrial and food safety, and government and
    academic customers grew 3%, 13% and 10%, respectively. The
    increases were primarily attributable to the demand for the
    Company’s new products in the U.S. and Asia, new
    governmental regulatory testing requirements, higher awareness
    of food safety issues and higher chemistry consumable and
    service sales.

The Waters Division’s products and services primarily
    consist of high performance liquid chromatography
    (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography
    (“UPLC

®

”

    and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass
    spectrometry (“MS”) and chemistry consumable products
    and related services. The Waters Division sales decline of 4% in
    2009 as compared with 2008 was primarily attributable to weaker
    demand for instrument systems due to the reduction in capital
    spending by the Company’s customers as a result of the
    global recession. The Waters Division’s recurring revenue
    growth from chemistry consumables and service was 2% in 2009 as
    compared to 2008, primarily from the effect of acquisitions. The
    Waters Division sales grew by 7% in 2008 as compared with 2007.
    The Waters Division sales growth in 2008 was strongly influenced
    by ACQUITY UPLC sales, shipments of new
    Synapt

tm

HDMS

tm

,

    Xevo

tm

TQ and
    Synapt

tm

MS systems and recurring revenue growth from the service and
    chemistry consumables business.

In February 2009, the Company acquired all of the remaining
    outstanding capital stock of Thar Instruments, Inc.
    (“Thar”), a privately-held global leader in the
    design, development and manufacture of analytical and
    preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical
    fluid extraction (“SFC”) systems, for $36 million
    in cash, including the assumption of $4 million of debt.
    The Company had previously made a $4 million equity
    investment in Thar in June 2007. Thar added approximately
    $17 million of product sales and was about neutral to
    earnings in 2009 after debt service costs. Recently acquired
    companies, both Thar and the 2008 acquisition of Analytical
    Products Group, Inc. (“APG”), added 2% to Waters
    Division’s sales in 2009.

The TA Division’s
    (“TA

®

”)

    products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis,
    rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales.
    Sales for TA decreased by 11% in 2009 as compared to 2008.
    TA’s sales decline in 2009 can be primarily attributed to a
    decrease in spending by the Company’s industrial customers
    as a result of the global economic recession. The July 2008
    acquisition of VTI Corporation (“VTI”) added 1% to
    TA’s sales in 2009 as compared to 2008. TA’s 2008
    sales growth of 10% as compared to 2007 can be primarily
    attributed to new product introductions, the effect of foreign
    currency translation and the impact of acquisitions.
    Acquisitions



and the effect of foreign currency translation added 3% and 2%,
    respectively, to TA’s 2008 sales as compared to 2007.

Operating income was $395 million, $390 million and
    $349 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    $5 million net increase in operating income in 2009 over
    2008 is primarily a result of the following:

•

Higher gross margins primarily from the net favorable effect of
    foreign currency translation;

•

Favorable benefits from product sales mix whereas 2009 contained
    a higher level of higher margin chemistry consumables and
    service sales than 2008;

•

Lower manufacturing costs; and

•

Lower selling, administrative and research and development
    expenses achieved through tight controls of discretionary
    spending and lower incentive compensation.

These 2009 increases were partially offset by lower gross margin
    dollars from lower unit volume; lower prices resulting from
    competitive situations in certain geographies and the impact of
    $6 million of expense in connection with the TA building
    lease termination payment and $3 million of severance costs
    related to a restructuring in Europe.

The $41 million net increase in operating income in 2008
    over 2007 is primarily the result of the benefits from an
    increase in sales volume, the favorable effect of foreign
    currency translation and the impact of a one-time
    $12 million expense recorded in 2007 related to a
    contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The 2008
    increase was partially offset by a patent litigation provision
    of $7 million and a $9 million impact of an

out-of-period

capitalized software amortization adjustment recorded during
    2008. During 2008, the Company identified errors originating in
    periods prior to the three months ended June 28, 2008. The
    errors primarily relate to (i) an overstatement of the
    Company’s income tax expense of $16 million as a
    result of errors in recording its income tax provision during
    the period from 2000 to March 29, 2008 and (ii) an
    understatement of amortization expense of $9 million for
    certain capitalized software. The Company incorrectly calculated
    its provision for income taxes by tax-effecting its tax
    liability utilizing a U.S. tax rate of 35% instead of an
    Irish tax rate of approximately 10%. In addition, the Company
    incorrectly accounted for Irish-based capitalized software and
    the related amortization expense as U.S. Dollar-denominated
    instead of Euro-denominated, resulting in an understatement of
    amortization expense and cumulative translation adjustment. For
    2008, the errors reduced the Company’s effective tax rate
    by 4.0 percentage points.

In 2009, the Company recorded approximately $5 million of
    tax benefit associated with the reversal of a $5 million
    tax provision which was originally recorded in 2008 relating to
    the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. The
    recognition of this tax benefit was a result of changes in
    income tax regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury in
    February 2009. The tax benefit recognized in 2009 decreased the
    Company’s effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points
    for 2009. The one-time tax provision recorded in 2008 increased
    the Company’s effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage
    points in 2008.

Net income per diluted share was $3.34, $3.21 and $2.62 in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Net income per diluted share grew
    at a rate of 4% in 2009 as compared with 2008 and 23% in 2008 as
    compared with 2007. Net income per diluted share was primarily
    impacted by the following factors in 2009, 2008 and 2007:

•

The benefits of a weaker British Pound on the Company’s
    manufacturing and operating costs.

•

Lower net interest and lower weighted-average shares and
    equivalents, as a result of the Company’s share buyback
    program, increased net income per diluted share in both 2009 as
    compared with 2008 and in 2008 as compared with 2007.

•

As described in the preceding paragraph, the $5 million tax
    benefit recorded in 2009 added $0.05 per diluted share to 2009
    and the $5 million tax provision recorded in 2008 decreased
    net income per diluted share in 2008 by $0.05.

•

The $6 million TA lease termination payment decreased the
    2009 net income per diluted share by $0.04.



•

The impact of the 2008

out-of-period

adjustments related to capitalized software amortization
    increased the 2008 net income per diluted share by $0.08.

•

The one-time contribution to the Waters Employee Investment Plan
    decreased the 2007 net income per diluted share by $0.08.

•

Higher effective tax rates, excluding the items described above,
    decreased net income per diluted share in 2009 as compared with
    2008. Lower effective tax rates, excluding the items described
    above, increased net income per diluted share in 2008 as
    compared with 2007.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million,
    $418 million and $371 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The 2009 cash provided by operating activities was
    consistent with the 2008 cash provided by operating activities
    despite the lower sales volume and the global economic
    recession. The $47 million increase in the operating cash
    flow in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily the result of
    higher net income and improved cash collections from customers,
    partially offset by a $13 million one-time transition
    benefit payment into the Waters Employee Investment Plan that
    was expensed in 2007, increases in inventory and the timing of
    payments to vendors.

Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital
    expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software
    capitalization were $94 million, $69 million and
    $60 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    increase in capital expenditures in 2009 is primarily attributed
    to $28 million spent to acquire land and construct a new TA
    facility, which was completed in 2009. In February 2009, the
    Company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock
    of Thar for $36 million in cash. The Company made an equity
    investment in Thar in June 2007 for $4 million in cash. The
    Company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses,
    product lines and technologies to augment the Waters and TA
    operating divisions.

Within cash flows used in financing activities, the Company
    received $19 million, $29 million and $91 million
    of proceeds from stock plans in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts are primarily
    attributed to changes in the Company’s stock price and the
    expiration of stock option grants. In February 2009, the
    Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
    repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common
    stock over a two-year period. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company repurchased 4.5 million, 4.1 million and
    3.4 million shares at a cost of $210 million,
    $235 million and $201 million, respectively, under the
    February 2009 authorization and previously announced stock
    repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the
    financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given
    current cash and debt levels, as well as to invest in research,
    technology and business acquisitions to further grow the
    Company’s sales and profits.

In February 2010, the Company issued and sold five-year senior
    unsecured notes at an interest rate of 3.75% with a face value
    of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2015. In
    addition, in early March 2010, the Company expects to issue and
    sell ten-year senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of
    5.00% with a face value of $100 million. This debt would
    mature in February 2020. The Company plans to use the proceeds
    from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other
    outstanding debt amounts and for general corporate purposes.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Net
    Sales

Net sales for 2009 and 2008 were $1,499 million and
    $1,575 million, respectively, a decrease of 5%. The effect
    of foreign currency translation lowered sales in 2009 by 2%.
    Product sales were $1,052 million and $1,140 million
    for 2009 and 2008, respectively, a decrease of 8%. The decrease
    in product sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due
    to the overall decline in Waters and TA instrument system sales
    due to lower spending by the Company’s customers as a
    result of the global economic recession and adverse effects from
    foreign currency translation. Service sales were
    $447 million and $435 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, an increase of 3%. The increase in service sales
    in 2009 as compared with 2008 was primarily attributable to
    increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher
    installed base of customers.



Waters
    Division Net Sales

The Waters Division net sales declined 4% in 2009 as compared to
    2008. The effect of foreign currency translation negatively
    impacted the Waters Division across all product lines, resulting
    in a decline in total sales of 2%. The 2009 acquisition of Thar
    and 2008 acquisition of APG added 2% to sales in 2009.

Chemistry consumables sales in 2009 were comparable to 2008,
    with the effect of foreign currency translation negatively
    impacting chemistry consumable sales by 2%. Waters Division
    service sales grew 3% in 2009 due to increased sales of service
    plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The
    service sales growth rate was negatively impacted by 1% from the
    effect of foreign currency translation. Waters instrument system
    sales (LC and MS) declined by 9% in 2009. The decrease in
    instrument system sales is primarily attributable to weak
    industrial and pharmaceutical customer spending caused by the
    global recession. The effect of foreign currency translation
    negatively impacted the 2009 instrument system sales by 2%.
    Waters Division sales by product line in 2009 were 52% for
    instrument systems, 18% for chemistry consumables and 30% for
    service, as compared to 55% for instrument systems, 17% for
    chemistry consumables and 28% for service in 2008.

Waters Division sales in Europe declined 9%, primarily due to
    weak demand in Eastern Europe and the effects of foreign
    currency translation, which decreased 2009 sales in Europe by
    6%. Waters Division sales in Asia increased 2% in 2009, with
    strong sales growth in China partially offset by weakness in
    other Asian markets. The effects of foreign currency translation
    increased Asia’s 2009 sales by 2%. Waters Division sales in
    the U.S. and the rest of the world declined 2% and 13%,
    respectively. The effects of foreign currency translation
    decreased 2009 sales in the rest of world by 3%.

TA
    Division Net Sales

TA’s sales were 11% lower in 2009 as compared to 2008
    primarily as a result of weak instrument system demand from its
    industrial customers. Foreign currency translation had minimal
    impact on TA’s 2009 sales as compared to 2008. The 2008
    acquisition of VTI added 1% to sales in 2009. Instrument system
    sales declined 15% in 2009 and represented 74% of sales in 2009
    as compared to 78% in 2008. TA service sales increased by 4% in
    2009 due to the increased sales of service plans and billings to
    a higher installed base of customers. Geographically, TA sales
    decreased in each market.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit for 2009 was $904 million compared to
    $914 million for 2008, a decrease of $10 million, or
    1%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 60.3% in
    2009 compared to 58.0% for 2008. The decrease in gross profit
    dollars in 2009 can be primarily attributed to the lower sales
    volume and lower prices in certain geographies offset by the
    benefits from net favorable foreign currency translation, a
    favorable change in sales mix and lower manufacturing costs.
    Gross profit in 2008 also had a $9 million charge from

out-of-period

adjustments related to capitalized software amortization. During
    2009, the Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales
    benefited from the favorable movements in certain foreign
    exchange rates between the currencies where the Company
    manufactures and services products and the currencies where the
    sales were transacted, principally the Euro, Japanese Yen and
    British Pound. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was also
    primarily impacted by the change in sales mix, with 2009
    containing a higher level of higher margin chemistry consumables
    and service sales than 2008.

Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses for 2009 and 2008 were
    $421 million and $427 million, respectively, a
    decrease of 1%. The decrease in 2009 selling and administrative
    expenses is primarily due to tighter control of discretionary
    spending including no merit increase in 2009, lower incentive
    compensation and the comparative favorable impact of foreign
    currency translation. The 2009 decreases were offset by the
    impact of the $6 million expense incurred in connection
    with the TA lease termination payment. As a percentage of net
    sales, selling and administrative expenses were 28.1% for 2009
    compared to 27.1% for 2008. This percentage increase can be
    attributed to the lower 2009 sales volume.



Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $77 million and
    $82 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively, a decrease of
    $5 million, or 5%. The decrease in research and development
    expenses in 2009 is primarily due to the comparative favorable
    impact of foreign currency translation.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $11 million and $39 million for
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in
    2009 is primarily attributable to a decrease in average
    borrowings, as well as significantly lower interest rates during
    2009 as compared to 2008.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $3 million and $21 million for
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest income is
    primarily due to significantly lower yields during 2009 as
    compared to 2008, as well as lower average cash and short-term
    investment balances.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were
    16.4% and 13.4%, respectively. Included in the income tax
    provision for 2009 is approximately $5 million of tax
    benefit relating to the reversal of a $5 million provision
    which was originally recorded in 2008 relating to the
    reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. The
    recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a result of changes
    in income tax regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury
    in February 2009. The $5 million tax benefit decreased the
    Company’s effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points
    in 2009. The one-time provision increased the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points in 2008. In
    addition, the effective tax rate for 2008 included a
    $16 million benefit resulting from

out-of-period

adjustments related to software capitalization amortization. The

out-of-period

adjustments had the effect of reducing the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points in 2008. After
    consideration of these items, the remaining change in the
    effective tax rates for 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily
    attributable to changes in income in jurisdictions with
    different effective tax rates.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Net
    Sales

Net sales for 2008 and 2007 were $1,575 million and
    $1,473 million, respectively, an increase of 7%. Foreign
    currency translation benefited sales growth for 2008 by 2%.
    Product sales were $1,140 million and $1,088 million
    for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of 5%. The increase
    in product sales was primarily due to the overall positive
    growth in Waters and TA instrument systems, chemistry
    consumables and foreign currency translation benefits. Service
    sales were $435 million and $385 million in 2008 and
    2007, respectively, an increase of 13%. The increase in service
    sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of service
    plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers and
    foreign currency translation benefits.

Waters
    Division Net Sales

The Waters Division net sales grew 7% in 2008 as compared to
    2007. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the
    Waters Division across all product lines, resulting in a benefit
    to total sales growth of 2%.

Chemistry consumables sales grew 9% in 2008 as compared to 2007.
    This growth was driven by increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC
    proprietary column technology and sales of HPLC columns. Waters
    Division service sales grew 12% in 2008 due primarily to
    increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher
    installed base of customers. Waters instrument system sales grew
    3% in 2008. The increase in instrument system sales during 2008
    is primarily attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC,
    Synapt HDMS, Synapt MS and the Xevo TQ. Sales were negatively
    impacted by the slowdown in industrial customer spending which
    occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the economic
    recession. Waters Division sales by product line were
    essentially unchanged in 2008 and 2007 with instrument systems,
    chemistry consumables and service representing approximately
    55%, 17% and 28% of sales, respectively.



Geographically, Waters Division sales in Europe, Asia and the
    rest of the world grew approximately 6%, 17% and 4% in 2008,
    respectively. Sales in the U.S. were flat in 2008. The
    sales growth in 2008 was primarily due to higher demand from the
    Company’s government, academic and industrial customers.
    Asia’s sales growth was primarily driven by increased sales
    in India and China. The effects of foreign currency translation
    increased sales growth in Europe and Asia by 4% and 5% in 2008,
    respectively.

TA
    Division Net Sales

TA’s sales grew 10% in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily
    as a result of new product introductions, acquisitions and the
    effect of foreign currency translation. The effect of foreign
    currency translation benefited the TA sales growth by 2% in 2008
    as compared to 2007. Instrument system sales grew 6% and
    represented approximately 78% and 81% of sales in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. TA service sales grew 27% in 2008 and can be
    primarily attributed to a higher installed base of customers and
    new service sales to the customers of recently acquired
    companies. Geographically, sales growth for TA in 2008 was
    predominantly in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The July 2008 VTI
    acquisition and the August 2007 acquisition of CSC added 3% to
    TA’s sales growth for 2008.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit for 2008 was $914 million compared to
    $842 million for 2007, an increase of $72 million, or
    9%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.0% in
    2008 compared to 57.2% in 2007. This increase is primarily due
    to higher sales volume, increased comparative benefits of
    foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, lower
    manufacturing costs. Also, the overall gross profit increase was
    negatively impacted by a $9 million

out-of-period

capitalized software amortization adjustment recorded during
    2008. The gross profit increase can also be attributed to a
    $3 million expense recorded in 2007 relating to the
    contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan.

Selling
    and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses for 2008 and 2007 were
    $427 million and $404 million, respectively, an
    increase of 6%. Included in selling and administrative expenses
    for 2007 is the impact of a one-time $7 million expense
    related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment
    Plan. The remaining $16 million increase in total selling
    and administrative expenses for 2008 is primarily due to annual
    merit increases, modest headcount additions to support increased
    sales volume and the comparative unfavorable impact of foreign
    currency translation. As a percentage of net sales, selling and
    administrative expenses were 27.1% for 2008 compared to 27.4%
    for 2007.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $82 million and
    $81 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of
    $1 million, or 1%. Included in research and development
    expenses for 2007 is $2 million of expense related to the
    contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The
    remaining increase in research and development expenses for 2008
    is primarily due to the timing of new product introduction
    costs, annual merit increases and modest headcount additions.

Litigation
    Provision

The Company recorded a $7 million provision in 2008 for
    damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with a
    judgment issued against the Company relating to an ongoing
    patent infringement lawsuit with Agilent Technologies Inc.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $39 million and $57 million for
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is
    primarily attributable to a decrease in average borrowing costs
    and lower average borrowings during 2008 as compared to 2007.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $21 million and $31 million for
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest income is
    primarily due to lower yields and lower cash and short-term
    investment balances.



Provision
    for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were
    13.4% and 17.1%, respectively. Included in the income tax
    provision for 2008 is approximately $5 million of tax
    provision associated with the reorganization of certain foreign
    legal entities. This one-time provision increased the
    Company’s effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points
    in 2008. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2008 included a
    $16 million benefit resulting from

out-of-period

adjustments related to software capitalization amortization. The

out-of-period

adjustments had the effect of reducing the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points in 2008. The
    2007 tax provision includes a $4 million tax benefit
    associated with a one-time contribution into the Waters Employee
    Investment Plan. The remaining decrease in the effective tax
    rate for 2008 is primarily attributable to proportionately
    greater growth in income in jurisdictions with comparatively
    lower effective tax rates.

Cash Flow
    from Operating Activities

Year
    Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million
    in both 2009 and 2008. The changes within net cash provided from
    operating activities in 2009 as compared to 2008 include the
    following significant changes in the sources and uses of net
    cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase
    in net income:

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2009 compared to 2008 is
    primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by
    customers and the lower sales volume in 2009 as compared to
    2008. Days-sales-outstanding (“DSO”) increased to
    67 days at December 31, 2009 from 63 days at
    December 31, 2008.

•

The change in inventories in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily
    attributable to the decrease in sales volume.

•

The 2009 change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities includes a $6 million litigation payment, which
    was accrued in 2008. In 2009, the Company also made a
    $6 million payment to terminate the lease on the old TA
    facility. In addition, accounts payable and other current
    liabilities changed as a result of the timing of payments to
    vendors and lower incentive compensation accruals.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in
    2009 and 2008 was a result of the installed base of customers
    renewing annual service contracts.



•

Other changes are comprised of the timing of various provisions,
    expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets
    and other liabilities.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million
    and $371 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    $47 million increase in net cash provided from operating
    activities in 2008 as compared to 2007 is attributed primarily
    to the following significant changes in the sources and uses of
    net cash provided from operating activities, aside from the
    increase in net income:

•

The change in accounts receivable in 2008 compared to 2007 is
    primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by
    customers and the higher sales volume in 2008 as compared to
    2007. DSO decreased to 63 days at December 31, 2008
    from 66 days at December 31, 2007.

•

The change in inventories in 2008 and 2007 is attributable to
    the increase in sales volume and an increase in ACQUITY UPLC and
    new mass spectrometry and TA products.

•

The 2008 change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities includes a $13 million one-time transition
    pension benefit payment into the Waters Employee Investment
    Plan. The 2007 change in accounts payable and other current
    liabilities includes the accrual related to the one-time
    transition benefit. In addition, accounts payable and other
    current liabilities changed as a result of the timing of
    payments to vendors.

•

Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in
    both 2008 and 2007 was a result of the installed base of
    customers renewing annual service contracts.

•

Other changes are comprised of the timing of various provisions,
    expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets
    and other liabilities.

Cash Used
    in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $419 million
    in 2009. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled
    $19 million in 2008. Net cash used in investing activities
    totaled $168 million in 2007. Additions to fixed assets and
    capitalized software were $94 million in 2009,
    $69 million in 2008 and $60 million in 2007. The
    increase in capital spending in 2009 can be attributed primarily
    to $28 million spent to acquire land and construct a new TA
    facility, which was completed in 2009. Capital spending returned
    to 2008 levels beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009; however,
    capital spending may increase periodically in the future in
    order to fund other facility expansions to accommodate future
    sales growth. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company purchased
    $518 million, $20 million and $391 million of
    short-term investments, respectively, while $229 million,
    $115 million and $295 million of short-term
    investments matured, respectively. Business acquisitions, net of
    cash acquired, were $36 million, $8 million and
    $9 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Cash Used
    in Financing Activities

In February 2010, the Company issued and sold five-year senior
    unsecured notes at an interest rate of 3.75% with a face value
    of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2015. In
    addition, in early March 2010, the Company expects to issue and
    sell ten-year senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of
    5.00% with a face value of $100 million. This debt would
    mature in February 2020. The Company plans to use the proceeds
    from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other
    outstanding debt amounts and for general corporate purposes.
    Interest on both issuances of the senior unsecured notes are
    payable semi-annually in February and August of each year. The
    Company may redeem some or all of the notes at any time in an
    amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount
    outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the
    applicable make-whole amount. These notes require that the
    Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less
    than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1
    for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters,
    respectively. In addition, these notes include negative
    covenants that are similar to the existing credit agreement.
    These notes also contain certain customary representations and
    warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default.



During 2009, the Company’s net debt borrowings increased by
    $92 million. During 2008 and 2007, the Company’s net
    debt borrowings decreased $348 million and
    $19 million, respectively.

In March 2008, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the
    “2008 Credit Agreement”) that provided for a
    $150 million term loan facility. In January 2007, the
    Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2007 Credit
    Agreement”) that provides for a $500 million term loan
    facility and $600 million in revolving facilities, which
    include both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility.
    Both credit agreements were to mature on January 11, 2012
    and required or require no scheduled prepayments before that
    date. The Company uses the revolving line of credit to fund its
    working capital needs.

In October 2008, the Company utilized cash balances associated
    with the effective liquidation of certain foreign legal entities
    into the U.S. to voluntarily prepay the $150 million
    term loan under the 2008 Credit Agreement. The repayment of the
    term loan effectively terminated all lending arrangements under
    the 2008 Credit Agreement.

The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are,
    at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate
    (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate
    plus


/


%)
    or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in
    each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the
    Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between
    33 basis points and 72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate
    loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis
    points for base rate loans. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires
    that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of
    not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than
    3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters,
    respectively. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes
    negative covenants that are customary for investment grade
    credit facilities. The 2007 Credit Agreement also contains
    certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative
    covenants and events of default.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had a total of
    $620 million borrowed under the 2007 Credit Agreement. The
    Company had $500 million classified as long-term debt and
    $120 million classified as short-term debt from this credit
    agreement and various other lines of credit. The Company has
    classified the revolving portion of the credit agreement as
    short-term debt as it is the Company’s intention to pay the
    outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the
    subsequent twelve months following the respective period end
    date. As of December 31, 2009, the total amount available
    to borrow under the 2007 Credit Agreement was $479 million
    after outstanding letters of credit.

In February 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of
    its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During
    2009, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost
    of $157 million under this program, leaving
    $343 million authorized for future repurchases. The Company
    repurchased 4.5 million, 4.1 million and
    3.4 million shares at a cost of $210 million,
    $235 million and $201 million during 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively, under the February 2009 authorization and
    previously announced programs.

The Company received $19 million, $29 million and
    $91 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options
    and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s
    employee stock purchase plan in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts are primarily
    attributed to the changes in the Company’s stock price and
    the expiration of stock option grants.

The Company believes that the cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments balance of $630 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and expected cash flow from operating
    activities, together with borrowing capacity from committed
    credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund working capital,
    capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase
    amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final
    determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve
    months. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that
    its financial position, along with expected future cash flows
    from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to
    raise funds from external sources, will be sufficient to meet
    future operating and investing needs for the foreseeable future.

The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days
    or less, in bank deposits; U.S., German, French and Dutch
    Government Treasury Bills; AAA rated U.S. Treasury Bills
    and European government bond money market funds. Similar
    investments with longer maturities are classified as short-term
    investments. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are
    convertible



to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of
    change in market value. The Company maintains balances in
    various operating accounts in excess of federally insured
    limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other
    than U.S. dollars.

Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of
    business.

The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are,
    at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate
    (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate
    plus


/


%)
    or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in
    each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the
    Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between
    33 basis points and 72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate
    loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis
    points for base rate loans. At current and long-term debt levels
    and interest rates consistent with those at December 31,
    2009, the Company’s interest expense would be approximately
    $5 million annually, which is not disclosed in the above
    table.

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third
    parties, which expire at various dates through 2010. Fees paid
    for licenses were less than $1 million each in 2009, 2008
    and 2007. Future minimum license fees payable under existing
    license agreements as of December 31, 2009 are immaterial.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
    in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
    business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
    its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
    individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.
    Current litigation is described in Item 3, Legal
    Proceedings, of Part I of this

Form 10-K.

The Company has long-term liabilities for deferred employee
    compensation, including pension and supplemental executive
    retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental
    retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent
    upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether
    the employee elects lump-sum or annuity payments. During fiscal
    year 2010, the Company expects to contribute approximately
    $3 million to $5 million to the Company’s defined
    benefit plans. Capital expenditures in 2009 were higher than in
    2008 primarily due to the $28 million spent to acquire land
    and construct a new TA facility, which was completed in 2009.
    Capital spending is expected to return to 2008 levels in 2010
    and may increase periodically in the future in order to fund
    other facility expansions to accommodate future sales growth.

The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting
    positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting
    standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the
    expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return
    reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax
    authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting
    positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the
    related tax effects for the time value of money. If all of the
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of
    December 31, 2009 were to become recognizable in the
    future, the Company would record a total reduction of
    approximately $78 million in the income tax provision. The
    Company’s uncertain tax positions are taken with respect to
    income tax return reporting periods beginning after
    December 31, 1999, which are the periods



that generally remain open to income tax audit examination by
    the various income tax authorities. As of December 31,
    2009, the Company expects that a tax audit of one of the
    Company’s U.K. affiliates’ tax returns for 2003, 2004
    and 2005 will be settled before December 31, 2010. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company does not expect the
    settlement of that audit to have a material effect on its
    consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company has
    monitored and will continue to monitor the lapsing of statutes
    of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes
    in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net
    interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
    Other than the aforementioned tax audit, as of December 31,
    2009, the Company does not expect to record any material changes
    in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net
    interest and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities
    due to the settlement of tax audit examinations or to the
    lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments
    within the next twelve months.

The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay
    any dividends in the foreseeable future.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Company has not created, and is not party to, any
    special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of
    raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its
    business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the
    Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated
    financial statements. The Company has not entered into any
    transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has
    subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other
    contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material
    continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation
    under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that
    provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk
    support to the Company.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Summary

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires
    the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
    and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical
    accounting policies are those that are central to the
    presentation of the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations that require management to make estimates
    about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a
    material impact on the Company’s results of operations
    given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to
    occur from period to period or use of different estimates that
    reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an
    ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates.
    The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
    various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements that require
    estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above.
    Changes in estimates used in these and other items could
    potentially have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
    product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
    Proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance
    of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost
    of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order.
    The Company’s products generally carry one year of
    warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once
    the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a
    service contract. Service contract billings are generally
    invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term
    and revenue is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
    contract term. At December 31, 2009, the Company had
    current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities of
    $95 million and $16 million, respectively.

Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
    evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
    until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
    specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted
    accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility
    is not reasonably assured. The Company’s method of revenue
    recognition for certain products requiring installation is in
    accordance with accounting standards



for revenue recognition. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when
    all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendor’s fee
    is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured
    and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria
    with contractual cash holdback are specified. With respect to
    installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash
    holdback or the fair value of the installation service is
    deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized
    as a multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete.
    The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon
    a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates,
    estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged
    by third parties. The Company believes that this amount
    approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the
    installation effort.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the
    accounting standards for software revenue recognition. Software
    revenue is recognized upon shipment, as typically no significant
    post-delivery obligations remain. Software upgrades are
    typically sold as part of a service contract, with revenue
    recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.

Loss
    Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
    to make required payments. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
    impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
    allowances may be required. The Company does not request
    collateral from its customers, but collectibility is enhanced
    through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit.
    The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors
    including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the
    customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends
    and the macro-economic environment. Historically, the Company
    has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns
    and allowances are estimates of future product returns related
    to current period revenue. Material differences may result in
    the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management
    made different judgments or utilized different estimates for
    sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The
    Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31,
    2009 was $314 million, net of allowances for doubtful
    accounts and sales returns of $7 million.

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
    or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis (“FIFO”). The Company estimates
    revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical
    obsolescence; historical demand; projections of future demand,
    including that in the Company’s current backlog of orders;
    and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or
    market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional write-downs may be required. The
    Company’s inventory balance at December 31, 2009 was
    $179 million, net of write-downs to net realizable value of
    $13 million.

Long-Lived
    Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles,
    long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could
    trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to,
    the following:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
    projected future operating results;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends; and,

•

significant changes or developments in strategic technological
    collaborations or legal matters which affect the Company’s
    capitalized patents, trademarks and intellectual properties,
    such as licenses.

When the Company determines that the carrying value of an
    individual intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill may
    not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of
    the above indicators, an estimate of undiscounted future cash
    flows produced by that intangible asset, long-lived asset or
    goodwill, including its eventual residual value, is compared to
    the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In
    the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient
    to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is
    written-down to its estimated fair value. Net intangible assets,
    long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $182 million,
    $211 million and $293 million, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2009. The Company performs annual impairment
    reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual review
    during the fourth quarter of 2009 and currently



does not expect to record an impairment charge in the
    foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that, at
    the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment
    charge will not be recorded.

Warranty

Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
    engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
    including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its
    component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is
    affected by product failure rates, material usage and service
    delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should
    actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery
    costs differ from the Company’s previous estimates,
    revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
    At December 31, 2009, the Company’s warranty liability
    was $10 million.

Income
    Taxes

As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes
    in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process
    involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure
    together with assessing changes in temporary differences
    resulting from differing treatment of items, such as
    depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and
    accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
    assets and liabilities, which are included within the
    consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results
    differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these
    estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish
    an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact
    its financial position and results of operations.

The accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company
    continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a
    valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, depending on
    whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those
    assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the
    Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting
    positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting
    standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the
    expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return
    reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax
    authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting
    positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the
    related tax effects for the time value of money. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company had unrecognized tax
    benefits of $78 million.

Litigation

As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I
    of this

Form 10-K,

the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters.
    With respect to each pending claim, management determines
    whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable
    and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when
    management has determined, with respect to a particular claim,
    both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate
    the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to
    either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in
    that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose
    additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to
    considerable interpretation.

With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management
    of the Company to date has been able to make this determination
    and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims
    described in Item 3. As developments occur in these matters
    and additional information becomes available, management of the
    Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their
    range, which may result in its recording charges or additional
    charges which could materially impact the Company’s results
    of operation or financial position.

Pension
    and Other Retirement Benefits

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
    and the fair values of plan assets for the Company’s
    pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated
    periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on
    relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the
    discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated
    and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the
    weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets will be 7.95% for its U.S. benefit plans and 3.34%
    for its

Non-U.S. benefit

plans.



At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount
    rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined
    the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and
    Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments
    and the Moody’s Aa interest rate as of December 31,
    2009 that best matched the timing of the plan’s future cash
    flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once
    the interest rates were determined, the plan’s cash flow
    was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement
    date. At December 31, 2009, the Company determined the
    weighted-average discount rate to be 5.95% for the
    U.S. benefit plans and 4.05% for the

Non-U.S. benefits

plans.

A one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate
    would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit cost for
    the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A
    one-quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long-term
    rate of return would decrease the Company’s net periodic
    benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than
    $1 million.

Stock-based
    Compensation

The accounting standard for stock-based compensation requires
    that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the
    statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company
    has used the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of
    its stock option awards. Under the fair-value recognition
    provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is
    measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and
    is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining
    the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires
    judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and
    employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results
    differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based
    compensation expense and the Company’s results of
    operations could be materially impacted. As stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements
    of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to
    vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated
    forfeitures. This accounting standard requires forfeitures to be
    estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
    subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical
    experience. If factors change and the Company employs different
    assumptions in the application of this accounting standard, the
    compensation expense that the Company records in the future
    periods may differ significantly from what the Company has
    recorded in the current period.

The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method
    permitted under the stock-based compensation accounting standard
    and, consequently, has not adjusted results from prior years.
    Under the modified transition method, compensation costs now
    include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards
    granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense related
    to any awards issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The
    Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line
    attribution method.

As of December 31, 2009, unrecognized compensation costs
    and related weighted-average lives over which the costs will be
    amortized were as follows (in millions):

Recent
    Accounting Standards Changes

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Standards

In June 2009, a new accounting standard was issued that
    establishes the hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles (“GAAP”) that are to be used as the source
    of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) for
    non-governmental entities in preparation of financial statements
    in conformity with GAAP in the United States. This standard was
    effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    September 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard by the
    Company did not have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.



In August 2009, a new accounting standard was issued for
    measuring liabilities at fair value. This standard provides
    clarification that, in circumstances in which a quoted price in
    an active market for the identical liability is not available, a
    reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or
    more of the following methods: (1) a valuation technique
    that uses (a) the quoted price of the identical liability
    when traded as an asset or (b) quoted prices for similar
    liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets;

and/or

(2) a valuation technique that is consistent with GAAP.
    This standard also clarifies that when estimating the fair value
    of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to adjust to
    include inputs relating to the existence of transfer
    restrictions on that liability. The adoption of this standard
    did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2009, a new accounting standard was issued to provide
    greater clarity about the credit and noncredit component of an

other-than-temporary

impairment event and to more effectively communicate when an

other-than-temporary

impairment event has occurred. This standard applies to debt
    securities. This standard was effective for periods ending after
    June 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard did not have a
    material effect on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2009, a new accounting standard was issued to require
    disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim
    as well as in annual financial statements. This standard was
    effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009. The
    adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In the second quarter of 2009, the Company implemented the newly
    issued subsequent events accounting standard. This standard
    establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure
    of events that occur after the balance sheet date, but before
    financial statements are issued. The adoption of this standard
    did not impact the Company’s financial position or results
    of operations. The Company evaluated all events or transactions
    that occurred after December 31, 2009 up through
    February 26, 2010, the date the Company issued these
    financial statements. During this period, the Company did not
    have any material recognizable subsequent events which have not
    been disclosed.

In December 2008, a new accounting standard was issued relating
    to the employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit
    plan assets. This requirement amends the previous accounting
    standard to provide guidance on employers’ disclosures
    about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other
    postretirement plan. This new standard is effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2009. The provisions of this new standard are
    not required for earlier periods presented and early adoption is
    permitted. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect
    on the Company’s financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2009, a new accounting standard was issued relating to
    the consolidation of variable interest entities. This statement
    addresses (1) the effects on certain provisions on existing
    accounting standards as a result of the elimination of the
    qualifying special-purpose entity concept and
    (2) constituent concerns about the application of certain
    key provisions of existing accounting standards, including those
    in which the accounting and disclosures under existing
    accounting standards do not always provide timely and useful
    information about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable
    interest entity. This standard is effective for periods
    beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this
    standard will not have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for
    multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This consensus amends
    existing revenue recognition accounting standards. This
    consensus provides accounting principles and application
    guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the
    arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated.
    This guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair
    value of undelivered products and services and instead provides
    for separate revenue recognition based upon management’s
    estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there
    is no other means to determine the fair value of that
    undelivered item. Previously the existing accounting consensus
    required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the
    price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between
    unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when
    the item is sold separately by the vendor. Under the existing
    accounting consensus, if the fair value of all of the



elements in the arrangement was not determinable, then revenue
    was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value
    was determined. This new approach is effective prospectively for
    revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The
    Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of
    this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for
    certain revenue arrangements that include software elements.
    This consensus amends the existing accounting guidance for
    revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and
    software. This consensus requires that tangible products which
    contain software components and non-software components that
    function together to deliver the tangible products essential
    functionality are no longer within the scope of the software
    revenue guidance. This new approach is effective prospectively
    for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The
    Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of
    this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its
    exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes
    other than trading, in accordance with the Company’s
    overall risk management guidelines.

The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange-rate risk
    with respect to certain inter-company balances, forecasted
    transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro,
    Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The Company
    manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis,
    which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take
    into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In
    addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non-derivative
    financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to
    currency fluctuations.

The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and
    cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
    interest rates. The Company’s policy is to manage interest
    costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that
    management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix
    in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered
    into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to
    exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed
    and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an
    agreed upon notional amount.

Hedge
    Transactions

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance the
    accounting standard for derivative instruments and hedging
    activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards
    for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
    instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
    activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging
    relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the
    consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or
    liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value
    hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of
    the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized
    in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow
    hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of
    the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and
    are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects
    earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are
    recognized in earnings. In addition, disclosures required for
    derivative instruments and hedging activities include the
    Company’s objectives for using derivative instruments, the
    level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as
    how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the
    Company’s financial position and performance.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage
    exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The
    Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to
    minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most
    effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign
    currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and
    links all derivatives designated as fair-value, cash flow or net
    investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
    consolidated



balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions. In
    addition, the Company considers the impact of its
    counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the
    contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under
    the contracts. The Company also assesses and documents, both at
    the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
    effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows
    associated with the hedged items.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
    to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
    related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In
    August 2007, the Company entered into two

floating-to-fixed-rate

interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of
    $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October
    2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan
    facility of its outstanding debt. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements. At
    both December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had a
    $2 million liability in other current liabilities in the
    consolidated balances sheets related to the interest rate swap
    agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company recorded a change of $2 million in accumulated
    other comprehensive income on these interest rate swap
    agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    the Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax unrealized loss of
    $1 million and $2 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, respectively, on these interest rate swap
    agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, the Company recorded additional interest expense of
    $2 million, $1 million and less than $1 million,
    respectively.

Hedges of
    Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
    throughout the world, with approximately 33% of its sales
    denominated in Euros, 11% in Japanese Yen and smaller sales
    exposures in other currencies in 2009. As a result, the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates. The Company uses cross-currency interest rate
    swaps, forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge
    its stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are
    designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in
    foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value
    of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements, forward
    contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in
    the value of the hedged net assets of the Company’s
    consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these derivative
    instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of
    certain foreign net assets of the Company.

During 2007, the Company hedged its net investment in Euro
    foreign affiliates with cross-currency interest rate swaps, with
    notional values ranging from $20 million to
    $50 million. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had no outstanding cross-currency interest rate swap
    contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
    $10 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    which consists of realized losses of $10 million.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
    principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain inter-company balances and short-term assets and
    liabilities. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro,
    Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The periods of
    these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
    and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be
    consistent with changes in the underlying exposures. Gains and
    losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
    administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
    operations. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional
    amounts totaling approximately $138 million,
    $120 million and $101 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had liabilities of
    less than $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in
    other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets
    related to the foreign currency exchange contracts. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company had assets of less than
    $1 million in other current assets in the consolidated
    balance sheets related to the foreign currency exchange
    contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $7 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $5 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $2 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward
    contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax



losses of $23 million, which consists of realized losses of
    $22 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $2 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end
    exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the
    fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of
    December 31, 2009 would decrease pre-tax earnings by
    approximately $14 million.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations
    from the investments of cash generated from operations. The
    Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days
    or less, in bank deposits; U.S., German, French and Dutch
    Government Treasury Bills; AAA rated U.S. Treasury Bills
    and European government bond money market funds. Similar
    investments with longer maturities are classified as short-term
    investments. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are
    convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant
    risk of change in market value. The Company maintains balances
    in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured
    limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other
    than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial
    paper issued by structured investment vehicles, collateralized
    debt obligation conduits or asset-backed conduits.

The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk
    due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of
    December 31, 2009, the carrying value of the Company’s
    cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value.



Item 8:

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
    detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

, our management,
    including our chief executive officer and chief financial
    officer, concluded that our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
    herein.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and of cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Notes 6 and 9 to the consolidated financial
    statements, respectively, the Company changed the manner in
    which it accounts for business combinations effective
    January 1, 2009 and uncertain tax positions effective
    January 1, 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Description
    of Business and Organization

Waters Corporation (“Waters” or the
    “Company”), an analytical instrument manufacturer,
    primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its
    Waters Division, high performance liquid chromatography
    (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography
    (“UPLC

®

”

    and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass
    spectrometry (“MS”) instrument systems and support
    products, including chromatography columns, other consumable
    products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These
    systems are complementary products that can be integrated
    together and used along with other analytical instruments. LC is
    a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of
    industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the
    chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and
    to purify a full range of compounds. MS instruments are used in
    drug discovery and development, including clinical trial
    testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as
    “proteomics”), food safety analysis and environmental
    testing. LC is often combined with MS to create LC-MS
    instruments that include a liquid phase sample introduction and
    separation system with mass spectrometric compound
    identification and quantification. Through its TA Division
    (“TA

®

”),

    the Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services
    thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments, which
    are used in predicting the suitability of fine chemicals,
    polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer
    goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science
    research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of
    software-based products that interface with the Company’s
    instruments and are typically purchased by customers as part of
    the instrument system.


Basis of
    Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and
    judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company
    evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
    recognition, product returns and allowances, bad debts,
    inventory valuation, equity investments, goodwill and intangible
    assets, warranty and installation provisions, income taxes,
    contingencies, litigation, retirement plan obligations and
    stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on
    historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
    believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
    of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Risks and
    Uncertainties

The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the
    analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to,
    global economic and financial market conditions, development by
    its competitors of new technological innovations, risk of
    disruption, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
    dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of
    proprietary technology, compliance with regulations of the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign
    regulatory authorities and agencies and changes in the fair
    value of the underlying assets of the Company’s defined
    benefit plans.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified in the
    accompanying financial statements in order to be consistent with
    the current year’s classifications.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly
    owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or
    controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All
    material inter-company balances and transactions have been
    eliminated.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and
    liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange
    rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and
    expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing
    during the period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
    consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s net sales
    derived from operations outside the United States were 69% in
    2009, 70% in 2008 and 68% in 2007. Gains and losses from foreign
    currency transactions are included in net income in the
    consolidated statements of operations and were not material for
    the years presented.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents primarily represent highly liquid investments,
    with original maturities of generally 90 days or less, in
    bank deposits; U.S., German, French and Dutch Government
    Treasury Bills; AAA rated U.S. Treasury Bills and European
    government bond money market funds, which are convertible to a
    known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change
    in market value. Similar investments with longer maturities are
    classified as short-term investments. The Company maintains
    balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally
    insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies
    other than U.S. dollars.

Short-Term
    Investments

Short-term investments are classified as

available-for-sale

in accordance with the accounting standard for investments in
    debt and equity securities. All

available-for-sale

securities are recorded at fair market value and any unrealized
    holding gains and losses, to the extent deemed temporary, are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
    stockholders’ equity, net of the related tax effects.
    Realized gains and losses are determined on the specific
    identification method and are included in other income (expense)
    net. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the
    value of the investment, the Company considers all available
    evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is
    “other than temporary” and marks the investment to
    market through a charge to the statement of operations. The
    Company classifies its investments as short-term investments
    exclusive of those categorized as cash equivalents. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company had short-term investments
    with a cost of $289 million, which approximated market
    value. The Company had no short-term investments as of
    December 31, 2008.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products and services to a significant
    number of large and small customers throughout the world, with
    net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately 51% in
    2009, 50% in 2008 and 52% in 2007. None of the Company’s
    individual customers accounted for more than 3% of annual
    Company sales in 2009, 2008 or 2007. The Company performs
    continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
    does not require collateral, but in certain circumstances may
    require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company
    has not experienced significant bad debt losses.

Seasonality
    of Business

The Company experiences an increase in sales in the fourth
    quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of
    customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by
    calendar year end.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
    the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the
    existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number
    of factors, including historical experience and the
    customer’s credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful
    accounts is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. Past due
    balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are
    reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are
    charged against the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

allowance when the Company feels it is probable that the
    receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any
    off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s
    allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands):

Inventory

The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost
    or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis (“FIFO”).

Income
    Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences
    between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets
    and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which
    the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance
    is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon
    the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or
    all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A liability
    has also been recorded to recognize uncertain tax return
    reporting positions.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures
    for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, while the
    costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation
    is provided using the straight-line method over the following
    estimated useful lives: buildings — fifteen to thirty
    years; building improvements — five to ten years;
    leasehold improvements — the shorter of the economic
    useful life or life of lease; and production and other
    equipment — three to ten years. Upon retirement or
    sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related
    accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated
    balance sheets and related gains or losses are reflected in the
    consolidated statements of operations. There were no material
    gains or losses from retirement or sale of assets in 2009, 2008
    and 2007.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests for goodwill impairment using a fair-value
    approach at the reporting unit level annually, or earlier, if an
    event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
    not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
    amount. Additionally, the Company has elected to make January 1
    the annual impairment assessment date for its reporting units.
    The goodwill and other intangible assets accounting standard
    defines a reporting unit as an operating segment, or one level
    below an operating segment, if discrete financial information is
    prepared and reviewed by management. Goodwill is allocated to
    the reporting units at the time of acquisition. Under the
    impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount
    exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is
    recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill
    exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value
    of reporting units was estimated using a discounted cash flows
    technique, which includes certain management assumptions, such
    as estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and
    discount rates.

The Company’s intangible assets include purchased
    technology; capitalized software development costs; costs
    associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and
    intellectual properties, such as licenses; debt issuance costs
    and acquired in-process research and development
    (“IPR&D”). Purchased intangibles are recorded at
    their fair



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

market values as of the acquisition date and amortized over
    their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years.
    Other intangibles are amortized over a period ranging from one
    to thirteen years. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the
    life of the related debt. Acquired IPR&D is amortized from
    the date of completion over its estimated useful life. In
    addition, acquired IPR&D will be tested for impairment
    until completion of the acquired programs.

Software
    Development Costs

The Company capitalizes software development costs for products
    offered for sale in accordance with the accounting standard for
    the costs of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.
    Capitalized costs are amortized to cost of sales over the period
    of economic benefit, which approximates a straight-line basis
    over the estimated useful lives of the related software
    products, generally three to five years.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs in
    accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other
    intangible assets. Capitalized internal software development
    costs are amortized over the period of economic benefit which
    approximates a straight-line basis over ten years. Net
    capitalized internal software included in property, plant and
    equipment totaled $2 million at December 31, 2009 and
    2008.

Investments

The Company accounts for its investments that represent less
    than twenty percent ownership, and for which the Company does
    not have significant influence, using the accounting standard
    for investments in debt and equity securities. Investments for
    which the Company does not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence, and for which there is not a readily
    determinable market value, are accounted for under the cost
    method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates the
    carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost
    method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost or
    estimated net realizable value. For investments in which the
    Company owns or controls between twenty and forty-nine percent
    of the voting shares, or over which it exerts significant
    influence over operating and financial policies, the equity
    method of accounting is used. The Company’s share of net
    income or losses of equity investments is included in the
    consolidated statements of operations and was not material in
    any period presented. All investments at December 31, 2009
    and 2008 are included in other assets and amounted to
    $4 million and $7 million, respectively.

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
    accordance with the accounting standard for property, plant and
    equipment. Whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company
    evaluates the fair value of the asset, relying on a number of
    factors, including, but not limited to, operating results,
    business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash
    flows. Any change in the carrying amount of an asset as a result
    of the Company’s evaluation is separately identified in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Fair
    Values of Financial Instruments

In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value
    measurements and disclosures, the Company’s assets and
    liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Fair values determined by
    Level 1 inputs utilize observable data such as quoted
    prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2
    inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active
    markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair
    values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable
    data points in which there is little or no market data, which
    require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities have been
    classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have
    been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently
    valued typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The
    pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including
    reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads,
    broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and
    economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by
    third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods
    and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. The fair
    values of the Company’s cash equivalents, short-term
    investments, retirement restoration plan assets, foreign
    currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements
    are determined through market and observable sources and have
    been classified as Level 2. After completing these
    validation procedures, the Company did not adjust or override
    any fair value measurements provided by third-party pricing
    services as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In January 2009, the Company implemented the accounting and
    disclosure requirements related to non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring
    basis. The adoption of this accounting and disclosure
    requirement did not have a significant impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.

Stockholders’
    Equity

In February 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of
    its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During
    2009, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost
    of $157 million under this program, leaving
    $343 million authorized for future purchases.

In February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of
    its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During
    2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company repurchased a total of
    8.2 million shares at a cost of $454 million under
    this program, which expired in February 2009.

The Company repurchased 4.5 million, 4.1 million and
    3.4 million shares at a cost of $210 million,
    $235 million and $201 million during 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively, under the February 2009 authorization and
    previously announced programs. The Company believes it has the
    resources to fund the common stock repurchases as well as to
    pursue acquisition opportunities in the future.

On August 9, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the
    adoption of a stock purchase rights plan where a dividend of one
    fractional preferred share purchase right (a “Right”)
    was declared for each outstanding share of common stock, par
    value $0.01 per share, of the Company. The dividend was paid on
    August 27, 2002 to the stockholders of record on that date.
    The Rights, which expire on August 27, 2012, become
    exercisable only under certain conditions. When they first
    become exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to buy
    from Waters one one-hundredth of a share of new Series A
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock (authorized limit of 4,000)
    for $120.00. When a person or group actually has acquired 15% or
    more of Waters’ common stock, the Rights will then become
    exercisable for a number of shares of Waters’ common stock
    with a market value of twice the $120.00 exercise price of each
    Right. In addition, the Rights will then become exercisable for
    a number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company with
    a market value of twice the $120.00 exercise price per Right.
    The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at a price of
    $0.001 per Right up until 10 days following a public
    announcement that any person or group has acquired 15% or more
    of the Company’s common stock.

Hedge
    Transactions

The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates and interest rates.

The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with
    the accounting standard for derivative instruments and hedging
    activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards
    for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
    instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
    activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging
    relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the
    consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or
    liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value
    hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of
    the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized
    in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow
    hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of
    the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and
    are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects
    earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are
    recognized in earnings. In addition, disclosures required for
    derivative instruments and hedging activities include the
    Company’s objectives for using derivative instruments, the
    level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as
    how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the
    Company’s financial position and performance.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage
    exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The
    Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to
    minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most
    effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign
    currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all
    relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and
    links all derivatives



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

designated as fair-value, cash flow or net investment hedges to
    specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance
    sheets or to specific forecasted transactions. In addition, the
    Company considers the impact of its counterparties’ credit
    risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability
    of each party to execute under the contracts. The Company also
    assesses and documents, both at the hedges’ inception and
    on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in
    hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes
    in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
    to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
    related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In
    August 2007, the Company entered into two

floating-to-fixed-rate

interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of
    $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October
    2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan
    facility of its outstanding debt. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements. At
    both December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had a
    $2 million liability in other current liabilities in the
    consolidated balances sheets related to the interest rate swap
    agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company recorded a change of $2 million in accumulated
    other comprehensive income on these interest rate swap
    agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    the Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax unrealized loss of
    $1 million and $2 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, respectively, on these interest rate swap
    agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, the Company recorded additional interest expense of
    $2 million, $1 million and less than $1 million,
    respectively.

Hedges of
    Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
    throughout the world, with approximately 33% of its sales
    denominated in Euros, 11% in Japanese Yen and smaller sales
    exposures in other currencies in 2009. As a result, the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates. The Company uses cross-currency interest rate
    swaps, forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge
    its stockholders’ equity balance from the effects of
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are
    designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in
    foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value
    of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements, forward
    contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in
    the value of the hedged net assets of the Company’s
    consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these derivative
    instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of
    certain foreign net assets of the Company.

During 2007, the Company hedged its net investment in Euro
    foreign affiliates with cross-currency interest rate swaps, with
    notional values ranging from $20 million to
    $50 million. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had no outstanding cross-currency interest rate swap
    contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
    $10 million in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    which consists of realized losses of $10 million.

Other

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
    principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain inter-company balances and short-term assets and
    liabilities. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro,
    Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The periods of
    these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
    and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be
    consistent with changes in the underlying exposures. Gains and
    losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
    administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
    operations. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional
    amounts totaling approximately $138 million,
    $120 million and $101 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had liabilities of
    less than $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in
    other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets
    related to the foreign currency exchange contracts. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company had assets of less than
    $1 million in



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets related
    to the foreign currency exchange contracts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company recorded cumulative net
    pre-tax gains of $7 million, which consists of realized
    gains of $5 million relating to the closed forward
    contracts and $2 million of unrealized gains relating to
    the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax losses of
    $23 million, which consists of realized losses of
    $22 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
    $2 million, which consists of realized gains of
    $3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and
    $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open
    forward contracts.

Revenue
    Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
    product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
    Proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance
    of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost
    of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order.

Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
    evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
    until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
    specifying fixed terms and prices. The Company’s method of
    revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation
    is in accordance with accounting standards for revenue
    recognition. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when all of the
    following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendor’s fee
    is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured
    and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria
    with contractual cash holdback are specified. With respect to
    installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash
    holdback or the fair value of the installation service is
    deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized
    as a multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete.
    The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon
    a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates,
    estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged
    by third parties.

The Company recognizes product revenue when legal title has
    transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company
    structures its sales arrangements as FOB shipping point or
    international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue
    upon shipment. In some cases, FOB destination based shipping
    terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue
    is recognized when the products arrive at the customer site.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales
    arrangements. Revenue associated with products that contain
    specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized before
    the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. Discounts from
    list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales.

Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the
    accounting standards for software revenue recognition. Software
    revenue is recognized upon shipment, as typically no significant
    post-delivery obligations remain. Software upgrades are
    typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue
    recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.

The Company assists customers in obtaining financing with an
    independent third-party leasing company with respect to certain
    product sales. Revenue is generally recognized upon product
    shipment under these arrangements. The Company receives payment
    from the leasing company shortly after shipment, provided
    delivery and credit documentation meets contractual criteria.
    The customer is obligated to pay the leasing company, but the
    Company retains some credit risk if the customer is unable to
    pay. Accordingly, the Company reduces revenue equal to
    pre-established loss-pool criteria, including contracts with
    recourse. The Company’s credit risk is significantly
    reduced through loss-pool limitations and re-marketing rights in
    the event of a default.

Product
    Warranty Costs

The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time
    of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated
    statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive
    product quality programs and processes, including actively
    monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies,
    the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product
    failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs
    incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the
    accrued warranty liability is based on historical information,
    such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units
    repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The
    liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.

The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s
    accrued warranty liability for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands):

Advertising
    Costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included
    in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated
    statements of operations. Advertising expenses for 2009, 2008
    and 2007 were $10 million, $9 million and
    $6 million, respectively.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised of costs
    incurred in performing research and development activities,
    including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead
    costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and
    development expenses are expensed as incurred.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company has two stock-based compensation plans, which are
    described in Note 12, “Stock-Based Compensation”.

Earnings
    Per Share

In accordance with the earnings per share accounting standard,
    the Company presents two earnings per share (“EPS”)
    amounts. Income per basic common share is based on income
    available to common shareholders and the weighted-average number
    of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
    Income per diluted common share includes additional dilution
    from potential common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to
    the exercise of stock options outstanding.

Comprehensive
    Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with
    the accounting standards for comprehensive income, which
    establishes the accounting rules for reporting and displaying
    comprehensive income and its components in a full set of
    general-purpose financial statements. The standard requires that
    all components of comprehensive income be reported in a
    financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence
    as other financial statements.

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Standards

In June 2009, a new accounting standard was issued that
    establishes the hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles (“GAAP”) that are to be used as the source
    of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) for
    non-governmental entities in preparation of financial statements
    in conformity with GAAP in the United States. This standard was
    effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    September 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard by the
    Company did not have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In August 2009, a new accounting standard was issued for
    measuring liabilities at fair value. This standard provides
    clarification that, in circumstances in which a quoted price in
    an active market for the identical liability is not available, a
    reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or
    more of the following methods: (1) a valuation technique
    that uses (a) the quoted price of the identical liability
    when traded as an asset or (b) quoted prices for similar
    liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets;

and/or

(2) a valuation technique that is consistent with GAAP.
    This standard also clarifies that when estimating the fair value
    of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to adjust to
    include inputs relating to the existence of transfer
    restrictions on that liability. The adoption of this standard
    did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2009, a new accounting standard was issued to provide
    greater clarity about the credit and noncredit component of an

other-than-temporary

impairment event and to more effectively communicate when an

other-than-temporary

impairment event has occurred. This standard applies to debt
    securities. This standard was effective for periods ending after
    June 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard did not have a
    material effect on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2009, a new accounting standard was issued to require
    disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim
    as well as in annual financial statements. This standard was
    effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009. The
    adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In the second quarter of 2009, the Company implemented the newly
    issued subsequent events accounting standard. This standard
    establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure
    of events that occur after the balance sheet date, but before
    financial statements are issued. The adoption of this standard
    did not impact the Company’s financial position or results
    of operations. The Company evaluated all events or transactions
    that occurred after December 31, 2009 up through
    February 26, 2010, the date the Company issued these
    financial statements. During this period, the Company did not
    have any material recognizable subsequent events which have not
    been disclosed.

In December 2008, a new accounting standard was issued relating
    to the employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit
    plan assets. This requirement amends the previous accounting
    standard to provide guidance on employers’ disclosures
    about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other
    postretirement plan. This new standard is effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2009. The provisions of this new standard are
    not required for earlier periods presented and early adoption is
    permitted. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect
    on the Company’s financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2009, a new accounting standard was issued relating to
    the consolidation of variable interest entities. This statement
    addresses (1) the effects on certain provisions on existing
    accounting standards as a result of the elimination of the
    qualifying special-purpose entity concept and
    (2) constituent concerns about the application of certain
    key provisions of existing accounting standards, including those
    in which the accounting and disclosures under existing
    accounting standards do not always provide timely and useful
    information about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable
    interest entity. This standard is effective for periods
    beginning after November 15, 2009.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on
    its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for
    multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This consensus amends
    existing revenue recognition accounting standards. This
    consensus provides accounting principles and application
    guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the
    arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated.
    This guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair
    value of undelivered products and services and instead provides
    for separate revenue recognition based upon management’s
    estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there
    is no other means to determine the fair value of that
    undelivered item. Previously the existing accounting consensus
    required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the
    price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between
    unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when
    the item is sold separately by the vendor. Under the existing
    accounting consensus, if the fair value of all of the elements
    in the arrangement was not determinable, then revenue was
    deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was
    determined. This new approach is effective prospectively for
    revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The
    Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of
    this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for
    certain revenue arrangements that include software elements.
    This consensus amends the existing accounting guidance for
    revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and
    software. This consensus requires that tangible products which
    contain software components and non-software components that
    function together to deliver the tangible products essential
    functionality are no longer within the scope of the software
    revenue guidance. This new approach is effective prospectively
    for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The
    Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of
    this standard will have a material effect on its financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.


Out-of-Period

Adjustments

During 2008, the Company identified errors originating in
    periods prior to the three months ended June 28, 2008. The
    errors primarily related to (i) an overstatement of the
    Company’s income tax expense of $16 million as a
    result of errors in recording its income tax provision during
    the period from 2000 to March 29, 2008 and (ii) an
    understatement of amortization expense of $9 million for
    certain capitalized software. The Company incorrectly calculated
    its provision for income taxes by tax-effecting its tax
    liability utilizing a U.S. tax rate of 35% instead of an
    Irish tax rate of approximately 10%. In addition, the Company
    incorrectly accounted for Irish-based capitalized software and
    the related amortization expense as U.S. Dollar-denominated
    instead of Euro-denominated, resulting in an understatement of
    amortization expense and cumulative translation adjustment.

The Company identified and corrected the errors in the three
    months ended June 28, 2008, which had the effect of
    increasing cost of sales by $9 million; reducing gross
    profit and income from operations before income tax by
    $9 million; reducing the provision for income taxes by
    $16 million and increasing net income by $8 million.
    For the year ended December 31, 2008, the errors had the
    effect of reducing the Company’s effective tax rate by
    4.0 percentage points. In addition, the

out-of-period

adjustments had the following effect on the consolidated balance
    sheet as of June 28, 2008: increased the gross carrying
    value of capitalized software by $46 million; increased
    accumulated amortization for capitalized software by
    $36 million; reduced deferred tax liabilities by
    $14 million and increased accumulated other comprehensive
    income by $17 million.

The Company did not believe that the prior period errors,
    individually or in the aggregate, were material to any
    previously issued annual or quarterly financial statements. In
    addition, the Company did not believe that the adjustments
    described above to correct the cumulative effect of the errors
    in the three months ended June 28, 2008 were material to
    the three months ended June 28, 2008 or to the full year
    results for 2008. As a result, the Company did not restate its
    previously issued annual financial statements or interim
    financial data.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company retired and disposed of
    approximately $7 million, $9 million and
    $4 million of property, plant and equipment, respectively,
    most of which was fully depreciated and no longer in use. Gains
    and losses on disposal were immaterial.


Acquisitions

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company implemented the
    newly issued accounting standard for business combinations. This
    standard requires an acquiring company to measure all assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent
    considerations and all contractual contingencies, at fair value
    as of the acquisition date. In addition, an acquiring company is
    required to capitalize IPR&D and either amortize it over
    the life of the product or write it off if the project is
    abandoned or impaired. This accounting standard is applicable to
    acquisitions completed after January 1, 2009. Previous
    standards generally required post-acquisition adjustments
    related to business combination deferred tax asset valuation
    allowances and liabilities for uncertain tax positions to be
    recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill. This new
    accounting standard does not permit this accounting and
    generally requires any such changes to be recorded in current
    period income tax expense. Thus, all changes to valuation
    allowances and liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    established in acquisition accounting, whether the business
    combination was accounted for under previous standards or under
    the newly issued accounting standard, will be recognized in
    current period income tax expense.

In February 2009, the Company acquired all of the remaining
    outstanding capital stock of Thar Instruments, Inc.
    (“Thar”), a privately-held global leader in the
    design, development and manufacture of analytical and
    preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical
    fluid extraction (“SFC”) systems, for $36 million
    in cash, including the assumption of $4 million of debt.
    Thar was acquired to add its environmentally-friendly SFC
    technology to the Company’s product line and to leverage
    the Company’s distribution channels. The Company had
    previously made a $4 million equity investment in Thar in
    June 2007. Immediately prior to the acquisition date, the
    Company remeasured the fair value of its original equity
    investment in Thar, resulting in an acquisition date fair



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value of $4 million. Thus, there was no gain or loss
    recognized in the statement of operations as a result of
    remeasuring the Company’s equity interest in Thar to fair
    value prior to the business combination.

The acquisition of Thar was accounted for under the newly issued
    accounting standard for business combinations and the results of
    Thar have been included in the consolidated results of the
    Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the
    acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and
    assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The
    Company has allocated $24 million of the purchase price to
    intangible assets comprised of customer relationships,
    non-compete agreements, acquired technology, IPR&D and
    other purchased intangibles. The Company is amortizing the
    customer relationships and acquired technology over
    15 years. The non-compete agreements and other purchased
    intangibles are being amortized over five years. These
    intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average
    period of 13 years. Included in intangible assets is a
    trademark in the amount of $4 million, which has been
    assigned an indefinite life. Also included in intangible assets
    are IPR&D intangibles in the amount of $1 million,
    which will be amortized over an estimated useful life of
    15 years once the projects have been completed and
    commercialized. The excess purchase price of $22 million
    has been accounted for as goodwill. The sellers also have
    provided the Company with customary representations, warranties
    and indemnification, which would be settled in the future if and
    when the contractual representation or warranty condition
    occurs. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Since
    the acquisition date, Thar added $17 million of sales to
    the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Thar’s impact on the Company’s
    net income since the acquisition date for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was not significant.

In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value
    measurements and disclosures, the Company measured the
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that were
    acquired through the acquisition of Thar at fair value. The fair
    value of these non-financial assets and non-financial
    liabilities were determined using Level 3 inputs. The
    following table presents the fair values, as determined by the
    Company, of 100% of the assets and liabilities owned and

In December 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of
    Analytical Products Group, Inc. (“APG”), a provider of
    environmental testing products for quality control and
    proficiency testing used in environmental laboratories, for
    $5 million in cash. This acquisition was accounted for
    under the purchase method of accounting and the results of APG
    have been included in the consolidated results of the Company
    from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition
    was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed
    liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The Company
    has allocated $3 million of the purchase price to
    intangible assets comprised of non-compete agreements, acquired
    technology, customer relationships and tradename. These
    intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average
    period of ten years. The excess purchase price of
    $1 million after this allocation has been accounted for as
    goodwill. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

In July 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of VTI
    Corporation (“VTI”), a manufacturer of sorption
    analysis and thermogravimetric analysis instruments, for
    $3 million in cash. This acquisition was accounted for
    under the purchase method of accounting and the results of VTI
    have been included in the consolidated results of the

Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the
    acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and
    assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The
    Company has allocated $1 million of the purchase price to
    intangible assets comprised of a non-compete agreement and
    acquired technology. These intangible assets are being amortized
    over a weighted-average period of nine years. The excess
    purchase price of $2 million after this allocation has been
    accounted for as goodwill. The goodwill is deductible for tax
    purposes.

In October 2007, the Company acquired certain net assets and
    customer lists from a South Korean distributor of thermal
    analysis products for a total of $2 million in cash. This
    acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting and the results of operations have been included in
    the consolidated results of the Company from the acquisition
    date.

In August 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
    capital stock of Calorimetry Sciences Corporation
    (“CSC”), a privately-held company that designs,
    develops and manufactures highly sensitive calorimeters, for
    $7 million in cash, including the assumption of
    $1 million of liabilities. This acquisition was accounted
    for under the purchase method of accounting and the results of
    operations of CSC have been included in the consolidated results
    of the Company from the acquisition date.

The pro forma effect of the ongoing operations for Waters, Thar,
    APG, VTI, CSC and other acquisitions as though these
    acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the periods
    covered by this report is immaterial.


Goodwill
    and Other Intangibles

The carrying amount of goodwill was $293 million,
    $268 million and $273 million at December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in goodwill in
    2009 is primarily due to the Company’s acquisition of Thar,
    which increased goodwill by $22 million (Note 6). In
    addition, currency translation adjustments increased goodwill by
    $3 million in 2009. The decrease in goodwill in 2008 is
    attributable to an $8 million decrease due to currency
    translation being partially offset by the $3 million of
    goodwill from the Company’s acquisitions of VTI and APG.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    acquired $24 million of purchased intangibles as a result
    of the acquisition of Thar. During 2008, the gross carrying
    value of capitalized software and related accumulated
    amortization increased by $46 million and $36 million,
    respectively, primarily as a result of an

out-of-period

adjustment (Note 3). During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company acquired $4 million of
    purchased intangibles as a result of the acquisitions of VTI and
    APG. In addition, the gross carrying value of intangible assets
    increased by $4 million in 2009 and decreased by
    $25 million in 2008 due to the effect of foreign currency
    translation. The gross carrying value of accumulated
    amortization for intangible assets increased by $3 million
    in 2009 and decreased by $17 million in 2008 due to the
    effect of foreign currency translation.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    amortization expense for intangible assets was $25 million,
    $36 million and $26 million, respectively. Included in
    amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2008
    is a $9 million

out-of-period

adjustment related to capitalized software. Amortization expense
    for intangible assets is estimated to be approximately
    $30 million for each of the next five years.

Debt

In February 2010, the Company issued and sold five-year senior
    unsecured notes at an interest rate of 3.75% with a face value
    of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2015. The
    Company plans to use the proceeds from the issuance of these
    senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt amounts
    and for general corporate purposes. Interest on both issuances
    of the senior unsecured notes are payable semi-annually in
    February and August of each year. The Company may redeem some or
    all of the notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of
    the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and
    unpaid interest, plus the applicable make-whole amount. These
    notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage
    ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of
    not more than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal
    quarters, respectively. In addition, these notes include
    negative covenants that are similar to the existing credit
    agreement. These notes also contain certain customary
    representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events
    of default.

In March 2008, the Company entered into a new credit agreement
    (the “2008 Credit Agreement”) that provided for a
    $150 million term loan facility. In January 2007, the
    Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2007 Credit
    Agreement”) that provides for a $500 million term loan
    facility and $600 million in revolving facilities, which
    include both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility.
    Both credit agreements were to mature on January 11, 2012
    and required or require no scheduled prepayments before that
    date. The outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have
    been classified as short-term liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheets due to the fact that the Company utilizes the
    revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. It
    is the Company’s intention to pay the outstanding revolving
    line of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months
    following the respective period end date.

In October 2008, the Company utilized cash balances associated
    with the effective liquidation of certain foreign legal entities
    into the U.S. to voluntarily prepay the $150 million
    term loan under the 2008 Credit Agreement. The Company prepaid
    the term loan in order to reduce interest expense and there was
    no penalty for prepaying the term loan. The repayment of the
    term loan effectively terminated all lending arrangements under
    the 2008 Credit Agreement.

The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are,
    at the Company’s option, equal to either the base rate
    (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate
    plus


/


%)
    or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in
    each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the
    Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between
    33 basis points and 72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate
    loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis
    points for base rate loans. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires
    that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of
    not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than
    3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters,
    respectively. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes
    negative covenants that are customary for investment grade
    credit facilities. The 2007 Credit Agreement also contains
    certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative
    covenants and events of default. As of December 31, 2009,
    the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had a total of
    $620 million borrowed under the 2007 Credit Agreement and
    an amount available to borrow of $479 million after
    outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2009,
    $500 million of the total debt was classified as long-term
    debt and $120 million classified as short-term debt in the
    consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company had $500 million borrowed under the 2007 Credit
    Agreement and an amount available to borrow of $599 million
    after outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2008,
    $500 million of the total debt was classified as long-term
    debt in the consolidated balance sheet. The weighted-average
    interest rates applicable to these borrowings were 0.78% and
    2.43% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available
    short-term lines of credit totaling $88 million at both
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. At December 31, 2009 and
    2008, related short-term borrowings were $12 million at a
    weighted-average interest rate of 1.97% and $36 million at
    a weighted-average interest rate of 2.18%, respectively.

    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company’s deferred tax assets associated with net
    operating loss, tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum
    tax credits are comprised of the following at December 31,
    2009: less than $1 million benefit of U.S. federal and
    state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in
    2020 and 2010, respectively; $71 million in foreign tax
    credits, which begin to expire in 2010; $11 million in
    research and development credits that begin to expire in 2010;
    and $1 million ($3 million pre-tax) in foreign net
    operating losses, $1 million ($2 million pre-tax) of
    which do not expire under current law, the remainder of which
    begin to expire in 2010. The Company has excluded the benefit of
    $14 million ($38 million pre-tax) of U.S. federal
    and state net operating loss carryforwards from the deferred tax
    asset balance at December 31, 2009. This amount represents
    an “excess tax benefit”, as the term is defined in the
    accounting standard for stock-based compensation, which will be
    recognized as a reduction to the Company’s accrued income
    taxes and an addition to its additional paid-in capital when it
    is realized in the Company’s tax returns.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company has provided a
    deferred tax valuation allowance of $84 million,
    principally against foreign tax credits ($71 million),
    certain foreign net operating losses and other deferred tax
    assets. The benefit relating to foreign tax credits and these
    other deferred tax assets, if realized, will be credited to
    additional paid-in capital.

The income tax benefits associated with non-qualified stock
    option compensation expense recognized for tax purposes and
    credited to additional paid-in capital were $5 million,
    $7 million and $17 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2009, there were unremitted earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1.4 billion. The
    Company has not provided for U.S. income taxes or foreign
    withholding taxes on these earnings as it is the Company’s
    current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside
    the U.S.

Effective on January 1, 2007, the Company adopted a new
    accounting interpretation standard relating to income taxes
    which prescribed the methodology by which a company must
    measure, report, present and disclose in its financial
    statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting
    positions that a company has taken or expects to take. This
    accounting standard requires financial statement reporting of
    the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return
    reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax
    authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting
    positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and
    circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the
    related tax effects for the time value of money. This standard
    also mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about
    uncertainty in income tax reporting positions. The Company
    recorded the effect of adopting this standard with a
    $4 million charge to beginning retained earnings in the
    consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2007.

The following is a summary of the activity in the Company’s
    unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    recorded increases of $1 million and $9 million,
    respectively, in unrecognized tax benefits via the income tax
    provision. In 2009, the Company recorded approximately
    $5 million of tax benefit relating to the reversal of a
    $5 million tax provision which was originally recorded in
    2008 relating to the reorganization of certain foreign legal
    entities. The recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a
    result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the
    U.S. Treasury in February 2009. If all of the
    Company’s unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of
    December 31, 2009 were to become recognizable in the
    future, the Company would record a total reduction of
    approximately $78 million in the income tax provision.

The Company’s accounting policy is to record estimated
    interest and penalties related to the potential underpayment of
    income taxes, net of related tax effects, as a component of the
    income tax provision. For each of the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company included
    $1 million ($2 million pre-tax) of such interest
    expense, net of related tax benefits, and no income tax penalty
    expense in the income tax provision. As of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, the Company had accrued $7 million
    ($10 million pre-tax) and $5 million ($8 million
    pre-tax), respectively, of such estimated interest expense, net
    of related tax benefits. As of both December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the Company had no income tax penalty expense accrued.

The Company’s uncertain tax positions are taken with
    respect to income tax return reporting periods beginning after
    December 31, 1999, which are the periods that generally
    remain open to income tax audit examination by the various
    income tax authorities. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Company expects that a tax audit of one of the Company’s
    U.K. affiliates’ tax returns for 2003, 2004 and 2005 will
    be settled before December 31, 2010. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company does not expect the
    settlement of that audit to have a material effect on its
    consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company has
    monitored and will continue to monitor the lapsing of statutes
    of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes
    in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net
    interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
    Other than the aforementioned tax audit, as of December 31,
    2009, the Company does not expect to record any material changes
    in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net
    interest and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities
    due to the settlement of tax audit examinations or to the
    lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments
    within the next twelve months.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s effective tax rates for years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were 16.4%, 13.4% and
    17.1%, respectively. Included in the income tax provision for
    2009 is approximately $5 million of tax benefit relating to
    the reversal of a $5 million provision which was originally
    recorded in 2008 relating to the reorganization of certain
    foreign legal entities. The recognition of this tax benefit in
    2009 was a result of changes in income tax regulations
    promulgated by the U.S. Treasury in February 2009. The
    $5 million tax benefit decreased the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2009. The
    one-time provision increased the Company’s effective tax
    rate by 1.4 percentage points in 2008. In addition, the
    effective tax rate for 2008 included a $16 million benefit
    resulting from

out-of-period

adjustments related to software capitalization amortization. The

out-of-period

adjustments had the effect of reducing the Company’s
    effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points in 2008. The
    2007 tax provision includes a $4 million tax benefit
    associated with a one-time contribution into the Waters Employee
    Investment Plan. The remaining changes in the effective tax
    rates for 2009, 2008 and 2007 are primarily attributable to
    changes in income in jurisdictions with different effective tax
    rates.


Litigation

The Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in
    the ordinary course of business. The Company believes the
    outcome, if the plaintiff ultimately prevails, will not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial position.

The Company has been engaged in ongoing patent litigation with
    Agilent Technologies GmbH in France and Germany. In January
    2009, the French appeals court affirmed that the Company had
    infringed the Agilent Technologies GmbH patent and a judgment
    was issued against the Company. The Company has appealed this
    judgment. In 2008, the Company recorded a $7 million
    provision and, in the first quarter of 2009, the Company made a
    payment of $6 million for damages and fees estimated to be
    incurred in connection with the French litigation case. The
    accrued patent litigation expense is in other current
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. No provision has been made for
    the German patent litigation and the Company believes the
    outcome, if the plaintiff ultimately prevails, will not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial position.


Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Lease agreements, expiring at various dates through 2026, cover
    buildings, office equipment and automobiles. Rental expense was
    $34 million, $30 million and $23 million during
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Future minimum rents payable as of
    December 31, 2009 under non-cancelable leases with initial
    terms exceeding one year are as follows (in thousands):

2014 and thereafter

The Company licenses certain technology and software from third
    parties, which expire at various dates through 2010. Fees paid
    for licenses were less than $1 million for each of the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Future
    minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements
    as of December 31, 2009 are immaterial for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and thereafter.

From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
    in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
    business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
    its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
    individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in
    its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements,
    the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse
    the indemnified party for



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally
    the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection
    with patent, copyright or other intellectual property
    infringement claims by any third party with respect to its
    current products, as well as claims relating to property damage
    or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by
    the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount
    of future payments the Company could be required to make under
    these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the
    Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
    relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and
    management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of
    these agreements is immaterial.


Stock-Based
    Compensation

In May 2003, the Company’s shareholders approved the
    Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (“2003
    Plan”). As of December 31, 2009, the 2003 Plan has
    3.0 million shares available for granting in the form of
    incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
    rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock
    units or other types of awards. The Company issues new shares of
    common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock
    unit conversion. Under the 2003 Plan, the exercise price for
    stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the
    underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2003 Plan is
    scheduled to terminate on March 4, 2013. Options generally
    will expire no later than 10 years after the date on which
    they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally
    vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR
    may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other
    award. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units may
    be issued under the 2003 Plan for such consideration as is
    determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors. No award of restricted stock may have a restriction
    period of less than three years except as may be recommended by
    the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or with
    respect to any award of restricted stock which provides solely
    for a performance-based risk of forfeiture so long as such award
    has a restriction period of at least one year. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had stock options,
    restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards outstanding.

In February 2009, the Company adopted its 2009 Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan under which eligible employees may contribute up
    to 15% of their earnings toward the quarterly purchase of the
    Company’s common stock. The plan makes available
    0.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock,
    which includes the remaining shares available under the 1996
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2009,
    0.9 million shares have been issued under both the 2009 and
    1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plans. Each plan period lasts three
    months beginning on January 1, April 1, July 1 and
    October 1 of each year. The purchase price for each share of
    stock is the lesser of 90% of the market price on the first day
    of the plan period or 100% of the market price on the last day
    of the plan period. Stock-based compensation expense related to
    this plan was $1 million, $1 million and less than
    $1 million for each of the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in
    accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based
    compensation, which requires that all share-based payments to
    employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on
    their fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the
    straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation
    expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations
    is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest;
    therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated
    forfeitures. This accounting standard requires forfeitures to be
    estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
    subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical
    experience. If actual results differ significantly from these
    estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the
    Company’s results of operations could be materially
    impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different
    assumptions in the application of this accounting standard, the
    compensation expense that the Company records in the future
    periods may differ significantly from what the Company has
    recorded in the current period.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The consolidated statements of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 include the following

    As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company has
    capitalized stock-based compensation costs of $3 million
    and $2 million, respectively, in capitalized software in
    the consolidated balance sheets.

Stock
    Option Plans

In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company
    makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including
    volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option
    lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    Company uses implied volatility on its publicly traded options
    as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The
    Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate
    indicator of expected volatility because it is generally
    reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how
    future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The
    expected life assumption for grants is based on historical
    experience for the population of non-qualified stock optionees.
    The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
    approximating the expected term used as the input to the
    Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the
    value of the stock options granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007 are as
    follows:

    price at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise
    the options) was $13 million, $26 million and
    $98 million, respectively. The total cash received from the
    exercise of these stock options was $16 million,

Restricted
    Stock

During each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, the Company granted eight thousand shares of restricted
    stock. The restrictions on these shares lapse at the end of a
    three-year period. The Company has recorded less than
    $1 million of compensation expense in each of the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to the
    restricted stock grants. The weighted-average fair value on the
    grant date of the restricted stock for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    $38.09, $76.75 and $48.88, respectively. As of December 31,
    2009, the Company has 24 thousand unvested shares of restricted
    stock outstanding with a total of less than $1 million of

Retirement
    Plans

U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution plan,
    after one month of service. Employees may contribute from 1% to
    30% of eligible pay on a pre-tax basis. Prior to the amendments
    described below, which became effective on January 1, 2008,
    the Company made matching contributions of 50% for contributions
    up to 6% of eligible pay after one year of service. Employees
    are 100% vested in employee and Company matching contributions.
    For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company’s matching contributions amounted to
    $10 million, $10 million and $4 million,
    respectively.

U.S. employees were eligible to participate in the Waters
    Retirement Plan, a defined benefit, cash balance plan, after one
    year of service. Annually, the Company credited each
    employee’s account as a percentage of eligible pay based on
    years of service. In addition, each employee’s account is
    credited with interest at the end of each year based



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

on the employee’s account balance at the beginning of such
    year. The interest rate is the one-year constant maturity
    Treasury bond yield in effect as of the first business day in
    November preceding such year plus 0.5%, limited to a minimum
    interest crediting rate of 5% and a maximum interest crediting
    rate of 10%. An employee does not vest until the completion of
    three years of service, at which time the employee becomes 100%
    vested. The Company maintains an unfunded supplemental executive
    retirement plan, the Waters Retirement Restoration Plan, which
    is non-qualified and restores the benefits under the Waters
    Retirement Plan that are limited by IRS benefit and compensation
    maximums.

In September 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved various amendments to freeze the pay credit accruals
    under the Waters Retirement Plan and the Waters Retirement
    Restoration Plan (collectively, the “U.S. Pension
    Plans”) effective December 31, 2007. In accordance
    with accounting standards for retirement benefits, the Company
    recorded a curtailment gain of $1 million. In addition, the
    Company re-measured the U.S. Pension Plans’
    liabilities in September 2007 and the Company reduced the
    projected benefit obligation liability by $7 million with a
    corresponding adjustment, net of tax, to accumulated other
    comprehensive income as a result of the curtailment reducing the
    accrual for future service.

The Company’s Board of Directors also approved a
    $13 million payment that was contributed to the Waters
    Employee Investment Plan in the first quarter of 2008. The
    $13 million of expense was reduced by a curtailment gain of
    $1 million, relating to various amendments to freeze the
    pay credit accrual, resulting in $12 million of expense
    recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the
    year ending December 31, 2007 with $3 million included
    in cost of sales, $7 million included in selling and
    administrative expenses and $2 million included in research
    and development expenses. In addition, effective January 1,
    2008, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the
    employer matching contribution in the Waters Employee Investment
    Plan to 100% for contributions up to 6% of eligible pay, an
    increase of 3%, and eliminated the one-year service requirement
    to be eligible for matching contributions.

The Company also sponsors other employee benefit plans in the
    U.S., including a retiree healthcare plan, which provides
    reimbursement for medical expenses and is contributory. There
    are various

non-U.S. retirement

plans sponsored by the Company. The eligibility and vesting of
    the

non-U.S. plans

are generally consistent with local laws and regulations.

The net periodic pension cost is made up of several components
    that reflect different aspects of the Company’s financial
    arrangements as well as the cost of benefits earned by
    employees. These components are determined using the projected
    unit credit actuarial cost method and are based on certain
    actuarial assumptions. The Company’s accounting policy is
    to reflect in the projected benefit obligation all benefit
    changes to which the Company is committed as of the current
    valuation date; use a market-related value of assets to
    determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior service
    costs on a straight-line basis over the expected future service
    of active participants as of the date such costs are first
    recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and losses
    in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related value of
    plan assets and the projected benefit obligation over the
    expected future service of active participants.

    of the following long-term investment objectives: achieving a
    return on assets consistent with the investment policy,
    achieving portfolio returns which exceed the average return for
    similarly invested funds and maximizing portfolio returns with
    at least a return of 2.5% above the one-year constant maturity
    Treasury bond yield over reasonable measurement periods and
    based on reasonable market cycles.

Within the equity portfolio of the U.S. retirement plans,
    investments are diversified among market capitalization and
    investment strategy. The Company targets a 20% allocation of its
    U.S. retirement plans’ equity portfolio to be invested
    in financial markets outside of the United States. The Company
    does not invest in its own stock within the U.S. retirement
    plans’ assets.

The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
    assumption, the Company considered the historical returns and
    the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as
    well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio and
    historical expenses paid by the plan. A one-quarter percentage
    point increase in the discount rate would decrease the
    Company’s net periodic benefit cost for the Waters
    Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one-quarter
    percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate of
    return would decrease the Company’s net periodic benefit
    cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million.

During fiscal year 2010, the Company expects to contribute
    approximately $3 million to $5 million to the
    Company’s defined benefit plans.

Business
    Segment Information

The accounting standard for segment reporting establishes
    standards for reporting information about operating segments in
    annual financial statements and requires selected information
    for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports
    of public business enterprises. It also establishes standards
    for related disclosures about products and services, geographic
    areas and major customers. The Company’s business
    activities, for which financial information is available, are
    regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision
    makers. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined
    that it has two operating segments: Waters Division and TA
    Division.

Waters Division is primarily in the business of designing,
    manufacturing, distributing and servicing LC and MS instruments,
    columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated
    and used along with other analytical instruments. TA Division is
    primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing,
    distributing and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and
    calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two divisions are
    its operating segments and each has similar economic
    characteristics; product processes; products and services; types
    and classes of customers; methods of distribution and regulatory
    environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments
    have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial
    statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial
    statements for financial information regarding the one
    reportable segment of the Company.

The Company experiences an increase in sales in the fourth
    quarter, as a result of purchasing habits on capital goods of
    customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by
    calendar year end. Selling and administrative expenses are
    typically higher in the second and third quarters over the first
    quarter in each year as the Company’s annual payroll merit
    increases take effect. Selling and administrative expenses will
    vary in the fourth quarter in relation to performance in the
    quarter and for the year. In the first quarter of 2009, the
    Company recorded approximately $5 million of tax benefit
    relating to the reversal of a $5 million tax provision
    which was originally recorded in the third quarter of 2008
    relating to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities
    (Note 9). In the second quarter of 2008, the Company
    recorded

out-of-period

adjustments related to capitalized software amortization and the
    income tax provision (Note 3). In the fourth quarter of
    2008, the Company recorded a $7 million provision related
    to ongoing litigation (Note 10).

Rules 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by

Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer concluded that the

    as of December 31, 2009 (1) to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed by the Company, including its
    consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or
    submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
    to the Company’s management, including its chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions
    regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
    forms.
