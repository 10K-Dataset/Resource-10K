INDEX



PART I

Item 1:

Business

General

Waters Corporation, (“Waters” or the
“Company”) an analytical instrument manufacturer,
designs, manufactures and sells, through its Waters Division,
high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”) and
mass spectrometry (“MS”) instrument systems and
associated service and support products, including
chromatography columns and other “consumable”
products. Through its TA Instruments Division
(“TAI”), the Company designs, manufactures, services
and sells thermal analysis and rheology instruments. The Company
is also a developer and supplier of software based products
which interface with the Company’s instruments and are
typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument
system.

The Company’s products are used by
pharmaceutical, life science, biochemical, industrial, academic
and government customers working in research and development,
quality assurance and other laboratory applications. The
Company’s HPLC instruments are utilized in this broad range
of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the
chemical, physical and biological composition of materials as
well as to purify a full range of compounds. MS instruments
are used in drug discovery and development, including clinical
trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes
(known as “proteomics”) and environmental testing. The
Company’s thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are
used in predicting the suitability of polymers and viscous
liquids for uses in various industrial, consumer goods and
health care products.

Waters is a holding company that owns all of the
outstanding common stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its
operating subsidiary. The Company previously operated as the
Waters Chromatography division of Millipore Corporation, prior
to a management buyout of the division that became effective on
August 18, 1994. Waters became a publicly traded company
with its initial public offering (“IPO”) in November
1995. Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and
complementary technologies to its range of products with the
acquisitions of Micromass Limited (“Micromass”) in
September 1997 and TAI in May 1996.

Business Segments

As indicated above, the Company operates in the
analytical instruments industry, manufacturing and distributing
products in three complementary technologies: HPLC, MS and
Thermal Analysis. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2003, the
Company completed the integration of the Micromass field sales,
service distribution and manufacturing organizations into the
Waters Division and changed the internal reporting structure to
reflect this integration. As a result, the Company has two
operating segments, Waters Division and TAI, which have similar
economic characteristics, product processes, products and
services, types and classes of customers, methods of
distribution, and regulatory environments. Because of these
similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one
reporting segment for financial statement purposes.

Waters Division

HPLC

Developed in the 1950’s, HPLC is the
standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent
components of a variety of chemicals and other materials.
HPLC’s performance capabilities enable it to separate and
identify 80% of all known chemicals and materials. As a result,
HPLC is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of
industries for research and development purposes, quality
control and process engineering applications.

The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are
those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries.
In these markets, HPLC is used extensively to identify new
drugs, to develop manufacturing methods, and to assure the
potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in
a variety of other applications such as the identification of
food content for nutritional labeling in the food and beverage
industry, the testing of water and air purity within the
environmental testing industry, as well as applications in



other industries, such as chemical and consumer
products. HPLC is also used by universities, research
institutions and government agencies, and in many instances, the
United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and
the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”), and their international counterparts, mandate
testing that requires HPLC instrumentation.

A complete HPLC system consists of five basic
components: solvent delivery system, sample injector, separation
column, detector and data acquisition unit. The solvent delivery
system pumps the solvent through the HPLC system, while the
sample injector introduces the sample into the solvent flow. The
chromatography column then separates the sample into its
components for analysis by the detector, which measures the
presence and amount of the constituents. The data acquisition
unit, usually referred to as the instrument’s software or
data system, then records and stores the information from the
detector.

The primary “consumable products” for
HPLC are chromatography columns. These columns are packed with
separation media used in the HPLC testing process and are
replaced at regular intervals. The chromatography column
contains one of several types of packing, typically stationary
phase particles made from silica. As the sample flows through
the column, it is separated into its constituent components.

Waters columns can be used on Waters-branded as
well as its competitors’ HPLC systems. The Company believes
that it is one of the few suppliers in the world that processes
silica, packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing
so, the Company believes it can better ensure product
consistency, a key attribute for its customers in quality
control laboratories, and react quickly to new customer
requirements.

During 2002 and 2003, the Company experienced
growth in its HPLC chromatography column and sample preparation
businesses, especially in the newly introduced
Xterra

TM

and Atlantis

TM

columns as well as
in Oasis

TM

sample preparation cartridges.

Based upon reports from independent marketing
research firms and publicly disclosed sales figures from
competitors, the Company believes that it is the world’s
largest manufacturer and distributor of HPLC Instruments,
chromatography columns and other consumables and related
services. The Company also believes that it has the leading HPLC
market share in the United States, Europe and non-Japan/ Asia
and believes it has a leading market share position in Japan.

Waters manufactures HPLC instruments that are
offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of
automation, from Breeze

TM

systems for academic
research applications, to fully automated Alliance

TM

2795 systems for high speed screening, and with a variety of
detection technologies, from UV absorbance to MS, optimized for
certain analyses. In 2003, the Company introduced new
application tailored HPLC systems for the analysis of biologics
as well as a new HPLC detector utilizing evaporative light
scattering technology to expand the usage of HPLC to compounds
that are not amenable to UV absorbance detection.

The servicing and support of HPLC instruments and
accessories is an important source of revenue for the Waters
Division. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale
of support plans, demand service, customer training and
performance validation services. Support plans most typically
involve scheduled instrument maintenance, a commitment to supply
software and firmware upgrades and an agreement to promptly
repair a non-functioning instrument in return for a fee
described in a one or two year contract that is priced according
to the configuration of the instrument.

In the third quarter of 2003, Waters expanded its
data management product lines through the acquisition of Creon
Lab Control AG (“Creon”). The new software products
available for sale by the Waters Division as a result of this
acquisition expand the range of the Company’s information
management offerings. The Company’s existing server based
software products, Millenium and Empower, are now completed by
the addition of Creon’s internet or “web” based
software that enables the reporting of scientific data sourced
from a broader array of instruments.



Mass Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical
technique that is used to identify unknown compounds, to
quantify known materials, and to elucidate the structural and
chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of
individual molecules that have been converted into ions.

The Company believes it is a market leader in the
development, manufacturing, sale and distribution of MS
instruments. These instruments can be integrated and used along
with other complementary analytical instruments and systems such
as HPLC, chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis
chromatography, gas chromatography and elemental analysis
systems. A wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the
overall category of MS instrumentation including devices that
incorporate quadrupole, ion trap, time of flight
(“Tof”) and classical magnetic sector technologies.
Furthermore, these technologies are often used in tandem to
maximize the efficacy of certain experiments.

Currently, the Company offers and provides
service, support and training for a wide range of MS instruments
utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof and magnetic
sector designs. These instruments are used in drug discovery and
development as well as for environmental testing. The majority
of mass spectrometers sold by Waters are designed to utilize an
HPLC system as the sample introduction device. These products
supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life
science, pharmaceutical, biomedical, clinical and environmental
markets worldwide. Service revenues are primarily related to the
sale of parts and with billed labor associated with instrument
repair and routine maintenance.

The mass spectrometer is an increasingly
important detection device for HPLC. The Company’s smaller
sized mass spectrometers (such as the single quadrupole
ZQ

TM

and Waters EMD

TM

) are often referred
to as HPLC “detectors” and are either sold as part of
an HPLC system or as an HPLC upgrade. Tandem quadrupole systems,
such as the Waters Quattro micro

TM

and Quattro
Ultima

TM

instruments, are used primarily for
experiments performed for late stage drug development, including
clinical trial testing, and Q-Tof Instruments such as the
Company’s Q-Tof micro

TM

and Q-Tof
Ultima

TM

instruments, are typically used to analyze
the role of proteins in disease processes, an application
sometimes referred to as “proteomics”. The majority of
mass spectrometers sold by the Company are designed to use an
HPLC system as the sample introduction device.

In 2003, the Company introduced two new mass
spectrometry systems, the Quattro Premier

TM

and the
LCT Premier

TM

. The Quattro Premier

TM

is a
new tandem quadrupole instrument that is designed to deliver a
higher level of speed, sensitivity and reliability in a more
compact configuration. The LCT Premier

TM

is a Q-Tof
instrument designed to deliver a new level of mass accuracy and
the ability for more precise quantitative analysis.

TAI

Thermal Analysis

Thermal analysis measures the physical
characteristics of materials as a function of temperature.
Changes in temperature affect several characteristics of
materials such as their physical state, weight, dimension and
mechanical and electrical properties, which may be measured by
one or more thermal analysis techniques. Consequently, thermal
analysis techniques are widely used in the development,
production and characterization of materials in various
industries such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles,
pharmaceuticals and electronics.

Rheometry instruments complement thermal
analyzers in characterizing materials. Rheology characterizes
the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity,
elasticity and deformation under different types of
“loading” or conditions. The information obtained
under such conditions provides insight to a material’s
behavior during manufacturing, transport, usage and storage.

The Company sells, supports and services these
products offering through TAI, headquartered in New Castle,
Delaware. This division operates independently from the Waters
Division though several of its overseas offices are situated in
Waters facilities. TAI has dedicated field sales and service
operations and service



revenue primarily derived from the sale of
replacement parts and from billed labor expenses associated with
the repair, maintenance and upgrade of installed systems.

Thermal analysis and rheometry instruments are
heavily used in material testing laboratories and in many cases
provide information useful in predicting the suitability of
polymers and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer
goods and health care products. As with HPLC, a range of
instrumentation is available with increasing levels of sample
handling and information processing automation. In addition,
systems and accompanying software packages can be tailored for
specific applications. For example, the Q-Series

TM

family of differential scanning calorimeters include a range of
instruments from basic dedicated analyzers to more expensive
systems that can accommodate robotic sample handlers and a
variety of sample cells and temperature control features for
analyzing a broad range of materials. In 2002, TAI introduced a
new dynamic mechanical analyzer (“DMA”), the
Q800

TM

DMA. In 2003, TAI introduced two new
DMA’s, the Q400

TM

DMA and the Q600

TM

DMA. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2003, TAI expanded
its Rheology product line through the acquisition of Rheometrics
Scientific, Inc. (“Rheometrics”). Within 2003,
the Rheometrics product line was successfully integrated within
the TA Instruments Division.

Customers

The Company has a broad and diversified customer
base that includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial
accounts, universities and government agencies. The
pharmaceutical segment represents the Company’s largest
sector and includes multinational pharmaceutical companies,
generic drug manufacturers and biotechnology companies. The
Company’s other industrial customers include chemical
manufacturers, polymer manufacturers, food and beverage
companies and environmental testing laboratories. The Company
also sells to various universities and government agencies
worldwide. The Company’s technical support staff work
closely with its customers in developing and implementing
applications that meet their full range of analytical
requirements.

The Company does not rely on any single customer
or one group of customers for a material portion of its sales.
During fiscal years 2003 and 2002, no single customer accounted
for more than 3% of the Company’s net sales.

Sales and Service

The Company has one of the largest sales and
service organizations in the industry focused exclusively on
HPLC, MS and thermal analysis markets. Across these
technologies, using respective specialized sales and service
forces, the Company serves its customer base with approximately
1,530 field representatives in 97 sales offices throughout
the world. The sales representatives have direct responsibility
for account relationships, while service representatives work in
the field to install instruments and minimize instrument
downtime for customers. Technical support representatives work
directly with customers, helping them to develop applications
and procedures. The Company provides customers with
comprehensive product literature and also makes consumable
products available through a dedicated catalog.

Manufacturing

The Company provides high quality HPLC products
by controlling each stage of production of its instruments and
columns. The Company assembles most of its HPLC instruments at
its facility in Milford, Massachusetts, where it performs
machining, wiring, assembly and testing. The Milford facility
employs manufacturing techniques that are expected to meet the
strict ISO 9002 quality manufacturing standards and FDA mandated
Good Manufacturing Practices. The Company outsources
manufacturing of certain electronic components such as
computers, monitors and circuit boards to outside vendors that
can meet the Company’s quality requirements.

The Company manufactures its HPLC columns at its
facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland,
where it processes, sizes and treats silica and polymer media
that are packed into columns, solid phase extraction cartridges
and bulk shipping containers. The Wexford facility also
manufactures and distributes certain data, instruments and
software components for the Company’s HPLC, MS and thermal



analysis product lines. These facilities meet the
same ISO and FDA standards met by the Milford, Massachusetts
facility and are approved by the FDA.

The Company manufactures most of its MS products
at its facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire, England and
Wexford, Ireland. Certain components or modules of the
Company’s MS instruments are manufactured by outside
long-standing contractors. Each stage of this supply chain is
closely monitored by the Company to maintain its high quality
and performance standards. The instruments, components or
modules are then returned to the Company’s facilities where
its engineers perform final assembly, calibrations to customer
specifications and quality control procedures.

Thermal analysis products are manufactured at the
Company’s New Castle, Delaware facility and rheology
products are manufactured at the Company’s New Castle,
Delaware and Leatherhead, England facilities. Similar to MS,
certain elements of TAI’s products are manufactured by
outside contractors and are then returned to the Company’s
facilities for final assembly, calibration and quality control.

Research and Development

The Company maintains an active research and
development program focused on the development and
commercialization of products which both complement and update
the existing product offering. The Company’s research and
development expenditures for 2003, 2002 and 2001, were
$59.2 million, $51.9 million and $46.6 million,
respectively. Nearly all of the current HPLC products of the
Company have been developed at the Company’s main research
and development center located in Milford, Massachusetts, with
input and feedback from the Company’s extensive field
organizations. The majority of the MS products have been
developed at facilities in England and nearly all of the current
thermal analysis products have been developed at the
Company’s research and development center in New Castle,
Delaware. At December 31, 2003, there were approximately
500 employees involved in the Company’s research and
development efforts. The Company has increased research and
development expenses relating to acquisitions and the
Company’s continued commitment to invest significantly in
new product development and existing product enhancements.
Despite the Company’s active research and development
programs, there can be no assurances that the Company’s
product development and commercialization efforts will be
successful or that the products developed by the Company will be
accepted by the marketplace.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 3,900
employees, with 48% located in the United States, and 3,600
employees, with 51% located in the United States at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase of
8% over 2002 is primarily due to the acquisitions of Rheometrics
and Creon. The Company considers its employee relations, in
general, to be good, and the Company’s employees are not
represented by any unions. The Company believes that its future
success depends, in a large part, upon its continued ability to
attract and retain highly skilled employees. During 2002, the
Company announced and commenced a restructuring in its Micromass
and HPLC organizations. The employment of approximately 55
people was terminated as a result of this organization
integration of which all had left the Company as of
December 31, 2003.

Competition

The analytical instrument and systems market is
highly competitive. The Company encounters competition from
several worldwide instrument manufacturers in both domestic and
foreign markets for each of its three technologies. The Company
competes in its markets primarily on the basis of instrument
performance, reliability and service and, to a lesser extent,
price. Some competitors have instrument businesses that are more
diversified than the Company’s business, but are typically
less focused on the Company’s chosen markets. Some
competitors have greater financial and other resources than the
Company.

In the markets served by HPLC and MS, the
Company’s principal competitors include: Applied
BioSystems, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., Thermo
Electron Corporation, Varian, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation
and Bruker BioSciences Corporation. In the markets served by
TAI, the Company’s principal competitors



include: PerkinElmer Inc., Mettler-Toledo
International Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, HAAKE and Parr-Physica.

The market for consumable HPLC products,
including separation columns, is also highly competitive but is
more fragmented than the analytical instruments market. The
Company encounters competition in the consumable columns market
from chemical companies that produce column chemicals and small
specialized companies that pack and distribute columns. The
Company believes that it is one of the few suppliers that
process silica, packs columns, and distributes its own product.
The Company competes in this market on the basis of
reproducibility, reputation and performance, and, to a lesser
extent, price. The Company’s principal competitors for
consumable products include Phenomenex, Supelco Inc., Agilent
Technologies, Inc., Alltech International
Holdings, Inc. and Merck and Co., Inc.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

The Company owns a number of United States and
foreign patents and has patent applications pending in the
United States and abroad. Certain technology and software are
licensed from third parties. The Company also owns a number of
trademarks. The Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses
are viewed as valuable assets to its operations. However, no one
patent or group of patents, or trademark or license is, in and
of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss would
materially affect the Company’s business as a whole.

Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to federal, state and
local laws, regulations and ordinances that (i) govern
activities or operations that may have adverse environmental
effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as
handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes,
and (ii) impose liability for the costs of cleaning up, and
certain damages resulting from sites of past spills, disposals
or other releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes
that it currently conducts its operations, and in the past has
operated its business, in substantial compliance with applicable
environmental laws. From time to time, operations of the Company
have resulted or may result in noncompliance with or liability
for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. In July 2003, the
Company entered into a settlement agreement (the
“Environmental Settlement Agreement”) with the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, acting by and through the
Attorney General and the Department of Environmental
Protection (“DEP”), with respect to alleged
non-compliance with state environmental laws at its Taunton,
Massachusetts facility. Pursuant to the terms of a final
judgment entered in the Superior Court of the Commonwealth on
July 10, 2003, the Company paid a civil penalty of
$5.9 million. In addition, the Company agreed to conduct a
Supplemental Environmental Project in the amount of
$0.6 million, comprised of investments in capital
infrastructure, to study the effects of bio-filtration on
certain air emissions from the Taunton facility and for the
purchase of equipment in connection therewith. Pursuant to the
terms of the Environmental Settlement Agreement, the Company
also agreed to undertake a variety of actions to ensure that air
emissions from the facility do not exceed certain limits and
that the facility is brought into full compliance with all
applicable environmental regulations. The Company does not
currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its
operations, financial condition or competitive position as a
result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws.

to update any forward-looking statements.

Risk Factors

Competition and the Analytical Instrument
Market:

The analytical instrument market, in particular,
the portion related to the Company’s HPLC, MS and thermal
analysis product lines, is highly competitive, and the Company
encounters competition from several international instrument
manufacturers and other companies in both domestic and foreign
markets. Some competitors have instrument businesses that are
more diversified than the Company’s business, but are
typically less focused on the Company’s chosen markets.
There can be no assurances that the Company’s competitors
will not introduce more effective and less costly products than
those of the Company, or that the Company will be able to
increase its sales and profitability from new product
introductions. There can be no assurances that the
Company’s sales and marketing forces will compete
successfully against its competitors in the future.

Additionally, the market may, from time to time,
experience low sales growth. Approximately 53% of the
Company’s net sales in 2003 were to the worldwide
pharmaceutical industry, which may be periodically subject to
unfavorable market conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable
industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations.

Risk of Disruption:

The Company manufactures HPLC instruments at its
facility in Milford, Massachusetts, separation columns at its
facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland,
MS products at its facilities in Manchester, England, Cheshire,
England and Wexford, Ireland, thermal analysis products at
its facility in New Castle, Delaware and rheology products at
its facilities in New Castle, Delaware and Leatherhead, England.
Any prolonged disruption to the operations at these facilities,
whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or



damage to either facility or other reasons, could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations and financial condition.

Restructuring and Other Unusual
Charges:

In July 2002, the Company commenced a combination
of its HPLC and MS field sales, service and support
organizations, the purpose of which was to enhance customer
service capabilities and eliminate redundant functions. The
integration efforts impacted the U.S., Canada, continental
Europe, the United Kingdom and various territories in the Asia
Pacific. The Company incurred charges of $2.6 million and
$7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, for both restructuring and other directly
related incremental costs.

In January 2004, the Company initiated a
restructuring effort to realign its personnel between various
support functions and various field, sales and service
organizations. As a result, approximately 80 employees are to be
terminated, primarily in the U.S., in the first quarter of 2004.
A similar number of new employees are to be hired in various
geographies around the world, primarily in sales and service
functions with the goal of increasing sales. The Company expects
to record a restructuring charge of approximately
$2.0 million in the first quarter of 2004.

Foreign Operations and Exchange
Rates:

Approximately 55% of the Company’s
2003 net sales were outside of the United States and were
primarily denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, a
significant portion of the Company’s sales and operations
are subject to certain risks, including adverse developments in
the foreign political and economic environment, tariffs and
other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing
foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences.

Additionally, the U.S. dollar value of the
Company’s net sales varies with currency exchange rate
fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the
U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations.

Reliance on Key Management:

The operation of the Company requires managerial
and operational expertise. None of the key management employees
has an employment contract with the Company, and there can be no
assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company.
If, for any reason, such key personnel do not continue to be
active in management, the Company’s operations could be
adversely affected.

Protection of Intellectual Property:

The Company vigorously protects its intellectual
property rights and seeks patent coverage on all developments
that it regards as material and patentable. However, there can
be no assurances that any patents held by the Company will not
be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights
granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the
Company. Conversely, there could be successful claims against
the Company where its intellectual property does not cover
competitor products or is invalidated. See, in particular, the
matter discussed herein in Item 3: Legal Proceedings, under
“Applera Corporation.” The Company’s patents,
including those licensed from others, expire on various dates.
If the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property
rights, it could have an adverse and material effect on the
Company’s results of operations and financial conditions.

Reliance on Customer Demand:

The demand for the Company’s products is
dependent upon the size of the markets for its HPLC, MS and
thermal analysis products, the level of capital expenditures of
the Company’s customers, the rate of economic growth in the
Company’s major markets and competitive considerations.
There can be no assurances that the Company’s results of
operations will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of
the factors listed above.



Reliance on Suppliers:

Most of the raw materials, components and
supplies purchased by the Company are available from a number of
different suppliers; however, a number of items are purchased
from limited or single sources of supply, and disruption of
these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on shipments
and the financial results of the Company. The Company believes
alternative sources could ordinarily be obtained to supply these
materials, but a prolonged inability to obtain certain materials
or components could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations and could result in
damage to its relationship with its customers.

Reliance on Outside Manufacturers:

Certain components or modules of the
Company’s MS instruments are manufactured by outside
long-standing contractors. Disruptions of service by these
outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply
chain and the financial results of the Company. The Company
believes that it could obtain alternative sources for these
components or modules, but a prolonged inability to obtain these
components or modules could have an adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Item 3:

Legal
Proceedings

Applera Corporation:

PE Corporation (since renamed Applera
Corporation), MDS, Inc. and Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex
(“the Plaintiffs”) filed a civil action against
Micromass UK Limited and Micromass, Inc., wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Company, in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware (“the Court”) on
February 18, 2000. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Quattro
Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer infringes
U.S. Patent No. 4,963,736 (“the patent”).
The patent is owned by MDS, Inc. and licensed to a joint venture
with Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments.

In March 2002, the Company was informed of a
jury’s finding that the Quattro Ultima with Mass Transit
ion tunnel technology infringes the patent. The same jury found
that the infringement was not willful and determined damages in
the amount of $47.5 million. The Court entered an
injunction in which the Company is enjoined from making, using
and selling in the U.S. the Quattro Ultima triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer incorporating features of the
patent.

In March 2003, the Court’s decision was
affirmed on appeal. In April 2003, the Company paid total
damages and interest of approximately $53.7 million to the
Plaintiffs. These instruments are manufactured in the United
Kingdom and shipments to the rest of the world outside of the
United States are not subject to this litigation. Similar claims
were asserted against the Company by the Plaintiffs in Japan and
Canada.

The accrued patent litigation expenses of
$19.9 million and $74.9 million recorded as of
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively,
in the consolidated balance sheets, is the Company’s best
estimate of its exposure for this liability. During the year
ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a
$0.5 million pre-tax charge for additional liabilities
associated with interest costs. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Company paid damages and interest of
$53.7 million, made legal payments of $0.4 million,
and reversed approximately $0.9 million of interest as a
credit to interest expense in the fourth quarter.

MDS, Inc. and Applied BioSystems/MDS Sciex
Instruments filed a civil action against Micromass
UK Limited, Waters Limited, wholly owned subsidiaries of
the Company, and the Company, in the High Court of Justice,
Chancery Division, Patents Court, UK on October 31, 2003.
The case alleged that certain of the Company’s MS
products infringe European Patent (UK) No. 0 373 835
(the “European Patent”). To the Company’s
knowledge, the European Patent is owned by MDS, Inc. and
licensed to a joint venture with Applied BioSystems/MDS Sciex
Instruments. The Plaintiffs in this action were seeking an
injunction against the Company to restrain it from infringing
the European Patent and an unspecified award of damages.



Previously, in July 2002, the Company filed a
civil action against Applera Corporation alleging patent
infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,304,798 owned by the
Company. In November 2002, the University of Manitoba (the
“University”) and Applera Corporation, its licensee,
filed a civil action against the Company alleging patent
infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,331,702 owned by the
University.

On March 2, 2004, the Company and MDS, Inc.
through its Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments partnership
and Applied Biosystems entered into a settlement agreement (the
“Applera Settlement Agreement”) with respect to the
various civil actions pending against each of them, both in the
United States and internationally. Stipulations of Dismissal or
their foreign equivalents (the “Stipulations”) with
respect to the disposal of all such actions have been submitted
to the applicable courts and tribunals in each of the United
States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.

The Applera Settlement Agreement provides for the
resolution of all patent infringement claims in the United
States made by certain of the parties against the other and of
international cases brought by MDS, Inc. and Applied
Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments against the Company with
respect to alleged infringements of those parties’ patents
at issue in the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.

In consideration of entering into the Applera
Settlement Agreement and the Stipulations, the Company and MDS,
Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments have entered
into royalty paying license agreements cross licensing the use
of the technology described in the parties’ respective
patents at issue. In addition, the Company made a one-time
payment to Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments of
$18.1 million on March 11, 2004, which is fully
accrued at December 31, 2003.

Hewlett-Packard Company:

The Company filed suit in the United
States against Hewlett-Packard Company and
Hewlett-Packard GmbH (collectively, “HP”),
seeking a declaration that certain products sold under the mark
“Alliance” do not constitute an infringement of one or
more patents owned by HP or its foreign subsidiaries (the
“HP patents”). The action in the United
States was dismissed for lack of controversy. Actions
seeking revocation or nullification of foreign HP patents
were filed by the Company in Germany, France and England. A
German patent tribunal found the HP German patent to be
valid. In Germany, France and England, HP and its
successor, Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH, have
brought an action alleging that certain features of the Alliance
pump may infringe the HP patents. In England, the Court of
Appeal has found the HP patent valid and infringed. The
Company’s petitions for leave to appeal to the House of
Lords have been denied. In France, the Paris District Court has
found the HP patent valid and infringed by the Alliance
pump. The Company has appealed the French decision. A German
court has found the patent infringed. The Company has appealed
the German decision. The Company recorded a provision in the
quarter ended June 30, 2002 for estimated damages incurred
with respect to this ongoing litigation. This provision
represents management’s best estimate of the probable and
reasonably estimable loss related to this litigation.

PerkinElmer Corporation:

The Company, through its subsidiary TAI, asserted
a claim against The PerkinElmer Corporation (“PE”)
alleging patent infringement of three patents owned by TAI (the
“TAI patents”). PE counterclaimed for
infringement of a patent owned by PE (the
“PE patent”). The U.S. District Court for
the District of Delaware granted judgment as a matter of law in
favor of TAI and enjoined PE from infringing the TAI patents.
PE appealed the District Court judgment in favor of TAI to
the federal appellate court. The District Court’s judgment,
with respect to PE’s infringement of the TAI patents,
was affirmed. The District Court’s judgment with respect to
TAI’s non-infringement of the PE patent was reversed
and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.

On remand to the District Court in October 2002,
a jury found PE liable to TAI for damages of
$13.3 million and found TAI did not infringe the
PE patent. In May 2003, the District Court entered judgment
on the jury’s verdict in favor of the Company. PE has
appealed the judgment with respect to TAI’s
non-infringement of the PE patent. As of December 31,
2003, no gain has been recorded and all litigation costs have
been expensed as incurred.



Other:

Cohesive Technologies, Inc.
(“Cohesive”) has brought three suits against the
Company in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. Cohesive
alleges that several products of the Company, which are part of
a much larger product line, are an infringement of two Cohesive
U.S. Patents. The Company has denied infringement of such
patents and has asserted several defenses. Two of the products
alleged to be an infringement are now obsolete and are no longer
sold in the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2001, a
jury returned a verdict in one of the suits finding the Company
liable for infringement of one of the two patents. The Company
intends to continue to vigorously defend its position. Judgment
has not been entered on the jury’s verdict and further
proceedings may preclude such entry. The Company believes it has
meritorious positions and should prevail either through judgment
or on appeal, although the outcome is not certain. The Company
believes that any outcome of the proceedings will not be
material to the Company.

Viscotek Corporation (“Viscotek”) filed
a civil action against the Company in the Federal District Court
for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, alleging
that one option offered by the Company with a high temperature
gel permeation chromatography instrument is an infringement of
two of its patents. These patents are owned by E.I. DuPont
de Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) and claimed to
be exclusively licensed to Viscotek. DuPont is not a party to
the suit. On January 16, 2004, a jury returned a verdict
finding that the Company had not infringed Viscotek’s
patents. Judgment has not been entered on the jury’s
verdict and further post trial motions and appeals by Viscotek
may preclude such entry. The Company believes it should prevail
either through judgment or appeal and that any outcome of the
proceedings will not be material to the Company.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Item 7:

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Financial Overview:

Sales grew by 8% in 2003 and by 4% in 2002.
Excluding currency effects, sales remained flat in 2003 and grew
2% in 2002. In 2003, HPLC and thermal analysis sales grew by
approximately 5% and 11%, respectively, while MS declined
approximately 18% excluding the Inorganic business, which was
sold in March 2003. Operating income for 2003 and 2002 was
$219.2 million and $196.4 million, respectively. The
increase of $22.8 million or 12% for the year is primarily
attributable to an increase in gross profit, a decrease in
litigation provisions from $7.9 million to
$1.5 million and a decrease in restructuring and other
unusual charges, net associated with the integration of the
worldwide HPLC and MS sales, service and support organizations
from $7.4 million to $0.9 million. In addition, in
2002 the Company recorded a $2.4 million charge for an
other-than-temporary impairment of a long-lived asset, for which
there was no such charge in 2003. Offsetting the increase in
operating income is the loss on sale of the inorganic MS product
line of $5.0 million, a charge for the expensed in-process
research and development of $6.0 million and increased
research and development expenses relating to acquisitions and
the Company’s continued commitment to invest significantly
in new product development and existing product enhancements.

The Company completed the $200 million stock
repurchase program during 2003 by purchasing $100.6 million
of the Company’s common stock. On May 6, 2003 the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
repurchase up to an additional $400 million in outstanding
common shares over a two-year period. The Company believes that
the share repurchase program is beneficial to shareholders by
increasing earnings per share via reducing the outstanding
number of shares through open market purchases. The Company
believes it has the resources to fund this effort as well as to
meet on-going operational cash flow needs and pursue acquisition
opportunities in the future. As of December 31, 2003,
7,540 shares had been purchased under the 2003 plan for
$224.0 million. In the aggregate, the Company repurchased
11,939 shares of its common stock for $324.6 million
during 2003. The Company had net borrowings at the end of 2003
of $246.3 million, primarily relating to borrowings in the
U.S. under the Company’s credit facility and term loan
facility for the stock repurchases.

In April 2003, the Company paid
$53.7 million for damages and interest relating to the
Applera patent litigation. Similar claims have been asserted
against the Company in other countries and there is a
possibility that claims may be made with respect to other
products in the MS line.

During 2003, approximately 55% of the
Company’s combined net sales were derived from operations
outside the United States. The Company believes that the
geographic diversity of its sales reduces its dependence on any
particular region. The U.S. dollar value of these revenues
varies with currency exchange fluctuations, and such
fluctuations can affect the Company’s results from period
to period.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to
Year Ended December 31, 2002

(The Company has included references to the
Notes of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 below.)

Net Sales:

Net sales for 2003 were $958.2 million and
were an increase of 8% compared to $890.0 million for 2002.
Excluding the favorable currency effects, net sales remained
essentially flat over 2002. In 2003, product sales increased
$25.9 million or 4% and service sales increased
$42.4 million or 22% over sales in 2002.

With respect to the Company’s performance by
product line (excluding the effects of currency translation),
HPLC sales overall grew approximately 5%. In 2003, HPLC
chemistry grew 11% primarily as a result of continued strength
in sales related to pharmaceutical production. HPLC service
sales grew 14% over



2002 due to increased sales of service plans to
our growing installed base of customers. Growth in chemistry and
service were offset by a decline of 1% in instrument sales
during 2003. The decline in instrument sales is largely
attributable to a combination of postponements and delays in
purchase decisions for such instruments by the Company’s
customers for new and replacement products. For the HPLC
business, service revenue was approximately 27% of total HPLC
revenue in 2003 compared to 25% of revenue in 2002. The growth
of service revenue was geographically broad-based and was driven
by increased demand from large multi-national customers for
service plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed
base and newly purchased Waters instruments. Chromatography
consumables account for approximately 19% of overall HPLC sales
and grew by approximately 11% in 2003. Chromatography consumable
growth was driven by increased utilization of existing HPLC
equipment and by the successful launch of a new line of
chromatography columns and sample preparation devices.
Geographically, the strongest growth areas of the world for HPLC
in 2003 were Asia, Japan and Eastern Europe, achieving 16%, 10%
and 40% growth, respectively. The U.S. grew modestly at 2%,
while Europe experienced a decline of 4%. Sales growth in Asian
and Eastern European geographies is related to economic
modernization and development of basic infrastructure. Japan
continues to be a robust market as Waters continues to offer
Japanese language software products that meet local needs.
Markets in the U.S. and Europe languished in 2003 as we saw a
continuation of delays in instrument replacements early in the
year at many of our pharmaceutical customers.

MS sales declined approximately 18% in 2003,
excluding the impact of the sale of the inorganic product line.
The decline in sales over 2002 was across most geographic areas,
primarily due to the impact of the Applera patent litigation,
reduced MS instrument prices and a decline in pharmaceutical
capital spending. Sales to customers working on proteomics
applications in the pharmaceutical industry, government and
academic sector and biotech all experienced declines in
instrument purchases in 2003. We believe that our sales decline
is a result of a temporary market decline in 2003 as well as a
loss of market share to competing technologies that resulted in
the overall 18% sales decline in MS. Service revenue for the MS
product line accounted for approximately 19% of total MS revenue
in 2003 compared to 12% in 2002, and grew approximately 27%
during this period. The growth in MS service revenue as a
percentage of overall MS revenue was primarily due to the
decline in MS instrument revenue, which is attributed to reduced
demand from proteomics customers.

Sales for thermal analysis products grew 20% in
2003, excluding the impact of the acquired rheology business.
The growth of this business is geographically broad-based with
increased spending by core industrial chemical and
pharmaceutical companies. The impact of sales in 2003 from the
rheology business acquisition added an additional 16% to the
thermal analysis business growth. TAI service revenue was
approximately 26% of total TAI revenue. Compared to 2002, TAI
service revenue grew by approximately 41% primarily as a result
of providing service to a larger installed base of instruments
and the Rheometrics acquisition.

Gross Profit:

Gross profit for 2003 was $560.4 million
compared to $516.5 million for 2002, an increase of
$43.9 million or 8%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales
increased to 58.5% in 2003 from 58.0% in 2002. The increase in
gross profit of 8% is generally linear with the net sales
increase of 8% which is mostly attributed to favorable foreign
exchange in 2003.

Selling, General, and Administrative
Expenses:

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for
2003 and 2002 were $264.3 million and $246.8 million,
respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses remained relatively flat at 27.6% for
2003 compared to 27.7% for 2002. The $17.4 million or 7%
increase in total selling, general and administrative expenses
for 2003 included an increase of approximately
$17.7 million as a result of currency translation, offset
by a reduction in operating expenses of $0.3 million. The
reduction in operating expenses includes cost savings of
$4.5 million from the recently completed HPLC and MS field
sales and service integration efforts, generating lower
headcount and labor costs, associated fringe benefits and travel
costs. These reductions were offset by annual merit increases
across most divisions and other headcount additions and related
fringe benefits and indirect costs associated with the 2003
acquisitions totaling approximately



$4.2 million. The Company experienced
realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains of
approximately $2.2 million in 2003 compared to losses of
$0.8 million in 2002, an increase of $3.0 million.

Research and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses were
$59.2 million for 2003 and $51.9 million for 2002, an
increase of $7.3 million or 14%. The increase is primarily
attributable to an increase in headcount due to acquisitions,
specifically Creon and Rheometrics, and to the Company’s
continued commitment to invest significantly in the development
of new and improved HPLC, MS, thermal analysis and rheology
products. In addition, the Company incurred contract research
and development costs of $1.8 million related to new
product development efforts for the Q-Tof product line.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangibles
Amortization:

Purchased intangibles amortization for 2003 was
$4.2 million compared to $3.6 million for 2002, an
increase of $0.6 million or 18%. The increase primarily
relates to amortization associated with the intangible assets
purchased as part of the Rheometrics and Creon acquisitions.

Litigation Provisions:

Litigation provision for 2003 was
$1.5 million compared to $7.9 million for 2002. The
Company recorded $1.5 million and $5.1 million in 2003
and 2002, respectively, relating to an environmental matter
concerning the Company’s Taunton facility (Note 13).
In 2002, the Company recorded $2.8 million for the Applera
patent litigation (Note 12) for liabilities associated
with product sales made prior to the day of the unfavorable
jury’s verdict in March 2002.

Loss on Sale of Business:

The Company recorded a $5.0 million charge
relating to the loss on the sale (Note 8) of the
inorganic MS product line in 2003. There was no such charge in
2002.

Impairment of Long-Lived Asset:

In 2002, the Company recorded a $2.4 million
charge for an other-than-temporary impairment of its technology
license with Variagenics, as the technology collaboration
program was discontinued (Note 5). There was no such charge
in 2003.

Restructuring and Other Unusual Charges,
net:

The Company recorded $2.6 million in 2003
and $7.4 million in 2002 for restructuring and other
directly related incremental costs relating to its integration
of the worldwide HPLC and MS sales, service, manufacturing and
support organizations. The charge in 2003 includes severance
costs for 13 people, distributor terminations and other directly
related incremental costs of this integration effort. The charge
in 2002 includes severance costs for 42 people, contract
cancellation fees, non-cancelable lease obligations and other
directly related incremental costs.

During 2003, the Company reversed approximately
$1.9 million in restructuring reserves, primarily
attributable to distribution and facility settlements being less
than previously estimated and the retention of certain employees
previously selected for employment termination. There were no
such reversals in 2002.

The Company has included in the consolidated
balance sheet in other long-term liabilities approximately
$1.1 million and $1.8 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, for non-cancelable lease
obligations with a portion to be paid out extending to 2012. The
remaining $1.5 million and $3.7 million of the
liability is included in other current liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.



The following is a rollforward of the
Company’s HPLC and MS integration restructuring liability
(in thousands):

The amount of expected annual cost savings is
approximately $6.0 million. The Company began realizing
savings of approximately $1.5 million per quarter beginning
in the second quarter of 2003. The Company believes that there
were no material increases in other expenses or reductions in
revenues as a result of this restructuring. The annual cost
savings is comprised of head count reductions of approximately
$4.2 million, reductions in related travel, promotional and
other expenses of approximately $1.6 million and facility
closures of approximately $0.2 million.

The Company also recorded an unrelated
restructuring provision of $0.1 million at its TAI
subsidiary for severance and other related costs in 2003. There
were no such charges in 2002.

Expensed In-Process Research and
Development:

In connection with the acquisition of Creon, the
Company wrote-off the fair value of purchased in-process
research and development (“IPR&D”) of various
projects for the development of new products and technologies in
the amount of $6.0 million. The amount was determined by
identifying research projects for which technological
feasibility had not been established and had no alternative
future uses. As of the acquisition date, there were four
projects that met the above criteria. The significant IPR&D
projects identified consist of the E Lab notebook and the
automatic LC-MS dereplication system. The IPR&D charges
associated with these projects were $4.5 million and
$0.8 million, respectively.

Management determined the valuation of the
IPR&D using a number of factors, including engaging a third
party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal. The
value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method.
This valuation included consideration of (i) the stage of
completion of each of the projects, (ii) the technological
feasibility of each of the projects, (iii) whether the
projects had an alternative future use, and (iv) the
estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated
from the various projects and technologies over their respective
projected economic lives.

The primary basis for determining the
technological feasibility of these projects was whether the
product has met predetermined design specifications and complex
functionality. As of the acquisition date, none of the IPR&D
projects had reached predetermined design specifications and
complex functionality. In assessing the technological
feasibility of a project, consideration was also given to the
level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each
project had to overcome. As of the acquisition date, the Company
estimated the E Lab notebook to be 90% complete and the
automatic LC-MS dereplication system to be 85% complete.

Future residual cash flows that could be
generated from each of the projects were determined based upon
management’s estimate of future revenue and expected
profitability of the various products and technologies involved.
These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present
values taking into account management’s estimate of future
expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to
completion. The discount rates include a rate of return, which
accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors
that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may
not be realized. The cash flows were discounted at discount
rates ranging from 55% to 60% per annum, depending on the
project’s stage of completion and the type of complex
functionality needed. This discounted cash flow methodology for
the various projects included in the purchased IPR&D
resulted in a total valuation of $6.0 million. Although
work on the projects related to the IPR&D continued after
the acquisition, the amount of the purchase price allocated to
IPR&D was written



off because the projects underlying the IPR&D
that was being developed were not considered technologically
feasible as of the acquisition date. As of December 31,
2003, the IPR&D projects still had not reached technological
feasibility. The expected remaining costs to complete these
projects are not considered material to the Company and there
are currently no expected material variations between projected
results from the projects versus those at the time of the
acquisition. The Company expects the projects to be completed
within the next twelve months.

Other Income (Expense), Net:

In 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded
$0.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, in
pre-tax charges for other-than-temporary impairments to the
carrying amounts of certain equity investments, including
investments in GeneProt and Variagenics (Note 5). During
2002, the Company recorded a $1.0 million charge to other
income (expense), in the consolidated statements of operations,
for an other-than-temporary impairment of the equity investment
and warrants resulting from Variagenics public stock price
declines that the Company believes reflected the lack of
profitable operations and a capital market that had little
liquidity for small biotech companies. In addition, in 2002, the
Company recorded pre-tax charges of $12.6 million to other
income (expense) for an other-than-temporary impairment of its
investment in GeneProt. This charge was recorded because to the
Company’s knowledge, GeneProt had been unable to generate
enough commercial interest to expand its business in the
U.S. market. Additionally, during 2003 and 2002, the
Company recorded a $0.3 million and $0.1 million
charge, respectively, to other income (expense) for the
impairment of certain other equity investments. The impairment
charges in 2002, were offset by a $7.7 million termination
fee received from GeneProt for cancellation of its
$20.0 million order. There were no such off-setting charges
in 2003.

Interest Expense:

Interest expense was $2.4 million and
$2.5 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total
interest expense in 2003 was offset by a $0.9 million
reduction in an interest expense estimate relating to the
calculation of interest expense for the Applera litigation paid
in April 2003 (Note 12). Excluding this reduction, interest
expense for 2003 would have been $3.3 million, or an
increase of 32%. This increase primarily relates to interest
expense on borrowings against the Company’s credit facility
to fund the stock repurchase program (Note 10). In 2002,
the interest expense primarily related to accrued post-judgment
interest associated with the Applera litigation.

Interest Income:

Interest income for 2003 and 2002 was
$7.1 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The
decline in interest income is primarily due to lower yields and
lower cash balances in the United Kingdom.

Provision for Income Taxes:

The Company’s effective income tax rate was
23.6% in 2003 and 22.1% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate
increased primarily due to lower effective tax rates on special
charges and the expensed in-process research and development
charge related to the Creon acquisition of $6.0 million not
being tax deductible under German statutory law.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting
Principle:

In 2002, the method of accounting for patent
related costs associated with patent litigation was changed
effective January 1, 2002 from a method of capitalizing the
patent related costs and amortizing them over their estimated
remaining economic life to expensing the costs as incurred. The
Company believes that this change is preferable because it will
provide a better comparison with the Company’s industry
peers, the majority of which expense these costs as incurred.
The $4.5 million cumulative effect of the change on prior
years (after reduction for income taxes of $1.3 million) is
included as a charge to net income for 2002. There were no such
changes for 2003.



Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Net Sales:

Net sales for 2002 were $890.0 million and
were an increase of 4% compared to $859.2 million for 2001.
Excluding the favorable effects of a weaker U.S. dollar,
2002 net sales increased by 2% over 2001. Product line
sales growth in 2002 before the effects of currency was 7% for
HPLC and 3% for TAI, offset by an 8% decline for MS.

Sales grew by 4% in 2002 and by 8% in 2001.
Excluding currency effects, sales grew 2% in 2002 and 10% in
2001. Sales growth, before currency effects, in both years
reflected increased customer demand for new products. In both
years, sales growth was primarily driven by a combination of the
replacement of existing instruments, increased service revenues
from a larger installed instrument base and the sales of new
instruments and consumables to customers to address their
increased sample testing needs. In addition, sales growth before
currency effects in 2001 reflected increased demand for new MS
products such as the Q-Tof Ultima

TM

used in drug and
life science research. In 2002, Waters’ growth was driven
primarily by improved HPLC instrument sales outside of the
United States and increased global demand for HPLC consumables
and services. HPLC instrument sales outside of the United States
were driven by new Alliance

TM

HPLC configurations
introduced in early 2002. Product line sales growth in 2002
before the effects of currency was 7% for HPLC, offset by a
decline of 8% for MS, and growth of 3% for TAI. Sales for MS
systems were adversely impacted by the effect of on-going patent
litigation in the United States. As a result of this litigation,
the Company withdrew the Quattro Ultima

TM

triple
quadrupole MS and versions of the Q-Tof Ultima

TM

,
configurations from the US market effective mid-March 2002. The
Company estimates that total MS sales in 2002 were reduced by
approximately $35 million as a result of this litigation.
Sales of high performance triple quadrupole instruments (Quattro
Ultima

TM

and its predecessor) in the United States in
2001 were approximately $20 million. The Q-Tof
Ultima

TM

was first shipped in mid-2001 and 2001 sales
in the United States were approximately $20 million.

Sales growth for HPLC was driven by relatively
healthy life science and pharmaceutical demand in Europe and new
business associated with recent economic modernization in
Eastern Europe. However, this growth was somewhat offset by flat
sales growth in the United States. The weakness in demand
experienced in the United States was primarily related to
reduced order volume from large pharmaceutical accounts during
the fourth quarter.

TAI’s sales growth was largely due to the
success of its newly introduced Q-Series

TM

differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) systems and thermal
gravimetric analysis systems (TGA).

For the HPLC business, service revenue grew 19%
in 2002 and was approximately 25% of total HPLC revenue in 2002
compared to 23% of revenue in 2001. The growth of service
revenue was geographically broad-based and was driven by
increased demand from large multi-national customers for service
plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed base
and newly purchased Waters instruments. Chromatography
consumables account for approximately 18% of overall HPLC sales
and grew by approximately 1% in 2002. However, the consumables
business in 2001 included a bulk media chromatography supply
contract that terminated in early 2002. The growth of the
chromatography business, without considering sales of this bulk
media in the prior year, was approximately 10%. Chromatography
consumable growth was driven by increased utilization of
existing HPLC equipment and by the successful launch of a new
line of chromatography columns and sample preparation devices.

The Company’s MS product line was affected
in the U.S. by the March 2002 unfavorable patent litigation
ruling involving sales of certain MS products. Service revenue
accounted for approximately 17% of total MS revenue in 2002
compared to 15% in 2001, and grew approximately 11% during this
period. The growth in MS service revenue as a percentage of
overall MS revenue was primarily due to the decline in MS
instrument revenue, which is attributed to the Applera
litigation.

TAI service revenue was approximately 9% of total
TAI revenue. Compared to 2001, TAI service revenue grew by
approximately 18% primarily as a result of providing service to
a larger installed base of instruments.



Gross Profit:

Gross profit for 2002 was $516.5 million
compared to $497.3 million for 2001, an increase of
$19.2 million or 4%. The majority of the increase in gross
profit is due to a 4% increase in sales volume from 2001 to
2002. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.0%
in 2002 from 57.9% in 2001. These gross profit amounts and gross
profit percentages reflect a reclassification of certain labor
and related costs associated with service revenues that were
previously classified in operating expenses and included in
selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company
experienced a higher mix of sales of more profitable consumables
and services in 2002 as well as reductions in HPLC manufacturing
costs due to lower material costs. The Company experienced
growth in its HPLC chromatography column and sample preparation
businesses, especially in the newly introduced
X-Terra

TM

, Atlantis

TM

columns as well as
in Oasis

TM

sample prep cartridges. Service revenue
growth across all product groups was a result of higher demand
for service plan contracts from major multi-national
pharmaceutical and chemical customers. In addition, the Company
acquired the businesses of its Irish and Korean distributors in
early 2002 and mid- 2001, respectively. As such, the incremental
profit from direct billings have increased gross profit and
gross profit percentages in 2002, as well as operating expenses.
The Company experienced an increase in service labor costs,
offsetting some of the above-mentioned increases in gross profit
and gross profit percentage.

Selling, General, and Administrative
Expenses:

Selling, general and administrative expenses for
2002 and 2001 were $246.8 million and $219.0 million,
respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses increased to 27.7% for 2002 from 25.5%
for 2001 after considering the reclassification of certain labor
and related costs discussed above. The $27.8 million or 13%
increase primarily resulted from increased headcount and related
costs required to support anticipated increased current and
future sales levels, including the acquisitions of Irish and
Korean distributor businesses. Headcount rose from 2,133 at
December 31, 2001 to 2,230 at December 31, 2002 or 5%.
In addition, the Company recorded an increase of approximately
$2.5 million in patent defense costs during 2002. The
Company changed its method of accounting for legal costs
associated with litigating patents effective January 1,
2002 and current year patent related expenses are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company also
recorded a provision of $1.5 million for estimated damages
incurred with respect to ongoing patent infringement litigation
during 2002. Expenses also slightly increased due to the effects
of currency translation. Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses were negligible in fiscal year 2002.

Research and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses were
$51.9 million for 2002 and $46.6 million for 2001, an
increase of $5.3 million or 11%. The Company continued to
invest significantly in the development of new and improved
HPLC, MS, thermal analysis and rheology products.

Goodwill and Purchased Technology
Amortization:

Goodwill and purchased technology amortization
for 2002 was $3.6 million compared to $7.1 million for
2001, a decrease of $3.5 million or 50%. The change was
primarily related to the elimination of goodwill amortization in
2002 in accordance with recently adopted accounting standards.

Litigation Provisions:

The Company recorded $2.8 million and
$75.0 million for the Applera patent litigation in 2002 and
2001, respectively. The 2002 charge of $2.8 million was for
additional liabilities associated with related product sales
made in 2002 prior to the day of the jury’s verdict in
March 2002. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the
Company recorded a litigation provision of $5.1 million
relating to an estimated settlement of an outstanding case with
the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
regarding the Company’s Taunton, Massachusetts facility.
The provisions represent management’s best estimate of the
probable and reasonably estimable loss related to this
litigation.



Impairment of Long-Lived Asset:

In 2002, the Company recorded a $2.4 million
charge for an other-than-temporary impairment of its technology
license asset with Variagenics, as the technology collaboration
program was discontinued. There was no such charge in 2001.

Restructuring and Other Unusual
Charges:

The Company recorded $7.4 million of charges
in the fourth quarter of 2002 for restructuring and other
directly related incremental costs relating to its integration
of the worldwide sales, service and distribution groups of the
Micromass division with the Waters HPLC division. The charges in
2002 include severance costs for 42 people, cancellation
penalties for distributor contracts, facility closure costs and
other specific incremental costs related to this integration.
The objective of this strategy is to leverage the strengths of
both divisions and align operating expenses to a more rational
level as a percentage of sales. There was no such charge in 2001.

The Company has included in the consolidated
balance sheet in other long-term liabilities approximately
$1.8 million at December 31, 2002, for non-cancelable
lease obligations with a portion to be paid out extending to
2012. The remaining $3.7 million of the liability is
included in other current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2002.

The following table provides additional
information about the 2002 restructuring and other unusual
charges (in thousands):

The amount of expected annual cost savings was
approximately $6.0 million. The Company believes that there
were no material increases in other expenses or reductions in
revenues as a result of this restructuring. The annual cost
savings is comprised of head count reductions of approximately
$4.2 million, reductions in related travel, promotional and
other expenses of approximately $1.6 million and facility
closures of approximately $0.2 million.

Other Income (Expense), Net:

In 2002, the Company recorded $13.7 million
in pre-tax charges for other-than-temporary impairments to the
carrying amounts of certain equity investments, including
investments in GeneProt and Variagenics. The impairment charges
were offset by a $7.7 million termination fee received from
GeneProt for cancellation of its $20.0 million order. To
the Company’s knowledge, this cancellation was due to
changes in GeneProt’s ability to generate enough commercial
interest to expand its business in the U.S. market. In
2001, the Company recorded a $7.1 million pre-tax charge
for an other-than-temporary impairment to the carrying amount of
certain equity investments, primarily its investment in
Variagenics.

Interest Expense:

Interest expense was $2.5 million and
$1.3 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase
in interest expense is due to an increase in interest expense
due to accrued post-judgment interest associated with the
Applera patent litigation (Note 12).

Interest Income:

Interest income for 2002 and 2001 was
$7.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively. The
increase of $1.3 million or 20% was due to higher cash
balances in 2002.



Provision for Income Taxes:

The Company’s effective income tax rate was
22.1% in 2002 and 22.3% in 2001. The 2002 tax rate decreased
primarily due to the continued favorable shift in the mix of
taxable income to lower tax rate jurisdictions.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting
Principle:

In 2002, the method of accounting for patent
related costs associated with patent litigation was changed
effective January 1, 2002 from a method of capitalizing the
patent related costs and amortizing them over their estimated
remaining economic life, to expensing the costs as incurred. The
Company believes that this change is preferable because it will
provide a better comparison with the Company’s industry
peers, the majority of which expense these costs as incurred.
The $4.5 million cumulative effect of the change on prior
years (after reduction for income taxes of $1.3 million) is
included as a charge to net income for 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During 2003, net cash provided by the
Company’s operating activities was $152.8 million,
primarily as a result of net income for 2003 and adding back
depreciation of $22.0 million, amortization of intangible
assets of $11.9 million, loss on sale of business of
$5.0 million, tax benefits related to stock option
exercises of $17.6 million, expensing of in-process
research and development of $6.0 million and changes in
working capital needs primarily accounts payable and accrued
expenses. During 2003, the Company paid approximately
$59.6 million in connection with both the Applera patent
litigation and the DEP settlement. Excluding the effects of
currency translation and the Rheometrics and Creon acquisitions,
accounts receivable decreased approximately $7.2 million
due to improved collection efforts at the end of 2003 compared
to 2002. Days-sales-outstanding stood at 71 days at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Within
liabilities, a decrease in accounts payable and other current
liabilities used $31.0 million, primarily as income and
other tax liabilities, and annual incentive payments were made.

The Company completed its $200 million stock
repurchase program during 2003 by purchasing $100.6 million
of the Company’s common stock. On May 6, 2003 the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
repurchase up to an additional $400 million in outstanding
common shares over a two-year period. The Company believes that
the share repurchase program is beneficial to shareholders by
increasing earnings per share via reducing the outstanding
number of shares through open market purchases. The Company
believes it has the resources to fund this effort as well as to
pursue acquisition opportunities in the future. As of
December 31, 2003, 7,540 shares had been purchased
under the 2003 plan for $224.0 million. In the aggregate,
the Company repurchased 11,939 shares of its common stock
for $324.6 million during 2003. The Company had net
borrowings at the end of 2003 of $246.3 million, primarily
relating to borrowings in the U.S. under the Company’s
credit facility and term loan facility for the stock repurchases.

In December 2003, the Company amended its
existing $250.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Agreement
dated February 2002 by closing on a $125.0 million Add-On
Term Loan Facility. The applicable interest to be charged
changed from being based on the ratio of debt to total
capitalization to debt to EBITDA. Loans under the amended Senior
Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest for each quarter
at a floating rate equal to, at the Company’s option,
1) the applicable LIBOR rate plus a varying margin between
0.60% and 1.50% or 2) prime rate. Other uses of cash flow
during the 2003 were $35.2 million for acquisitions
(Note 5) and $34.6 million for property, plant and
equipment and software capitalization investments. From
financing activities, the Company received $27.8 million of
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of
shares pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans.

The Company believes that the existing cash and
cash equivalent balance of $356.8 million and expected cash
flow from operating activities together with borrowings
available from its credit facility will be sufficient to fund
working capital, capital spending requirements, authorized share
repurchase amounts and any adverse final determination of
ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months.
Management believes its financial position, along with expected
future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and
the ability to raise funds from a number of financing
alternatives and external sources, will be sufficient to meet
future operating and investing needs beyond twelve months. The
Company also held approximately $49.9 million of restricted
cash at December 31, 2002 in connection with the standby
letter of credit issued by the Company for the



unfavorable judgment in the Applera patent
litigation (Note 12). As a result of the March 2003
affirmed judgment in the case, the Company paid approximately
$53.7 million to Applera in April 2003, and the Company is
no longer required to maintain a restricted cash balance. In
March 2004, the Company made a one time payment to the
Plaintiffs in the Applied BioSystems/MDS Sciex Instruments
matter of $18.1 million, which is fully accrued at
December 31, 2003. In July 2003, the Company paid
$5.9 million in settlement of the environmental matter with
the DEP in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts matter
(Note 13).

Commitments:

The Company paid $43.2 million in the first
quarter of 2004 for the acquisition of NuGenesis Technologies
Corporation, (“NuGenesis”). The Company has various
ongoing license and collaboration agreements in conjunction with
its research and development efforts, totaling $1.2 million
for the periods 2004 through 2008. Capital expenditures in 2004
are expected to be modestly higher than 2003 levels, as the
Company is evaluating its future facility needs. The Company has
commitments for lease agreements, expiring at various dates
through 2019, covering certain buildings, office equipment and
automobiles.

The Company licenses certain technology and
software from third parties, which expire at various dates
through 2008. Fees paid for licenses was approximately
$2.9 million in 2003, $5.4 million in 2002, and
$4.0 million in 2001. Future minimum licenses payable under
existing license agreements as of December 31, 2003 are
$0.8 million, $0.4 million, and immaterial for 2004,
2005 and 2008 and thereafter, respectively.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments

The following is a summary of the Company’s
commitments as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands):

From time to time, the Company and its
subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising
in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has
meritorious arguments and any outcome, either individually or in
the aggregate, with the exception of the current litigation
described in Note 12, Patent Litigation and Note 13,
Environmental Contingency, will not be material to the financial
position or results of operations.

The Company paid $43.2 million in the first
quarter of 2004 for the NuGenesis acquisition. This is described
in more detail in Note 22, Subsequent Events.

During fiscal year 2004, the Company expects to
contribute $10.0 million to the Company’s retirement
plans.

The Company is not aware of any undisclosed risks
and uncertainties, including but not limited to product
technical obsolescence, regulatory compliance, protection of
intellectual property rights, changes in pharmaceutical industry
spending, competitive advantages, current and pending
litigation, and changes in foreign exchanges rates, that are
reasonably likely to occur and could materially and negatively
affect the Company’s existing cash balance or its ability
to borrow funds from its credit facility. The Company also
believes there are no provisions in the new credit facility, its
real estate leases, and supplier and collaborative agreements
that would accelerate payments, require additional collateral or
impair its ability to continue to enter into critical



transactions. The Company has not paid any
dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the
foreseeable future.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

Summary:

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are
central to the presentation of the Company’s financial
condition and results of operations that require management to
make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain. On an
on-going basis, the Company evaluates its policies and
estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition:

Sales of products and services are generally
recorded based on product shipment and performance of service,
respectively. Partial proceeds received in advance of product
shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred
revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Once the product is
shipped all advance payments received associated with that
particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to
offset against the customer invoice. Shipping and handling costs
are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the
customer per the order. The Company’s products generally
carry one year of warranty. These costs are accrued at the point
of shipment. Once the warranty period has expired, the customer
may purchase a service contract. Service contract billings are
generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the
contract term, and revenue is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the contract term. At December 31, 2003, the Company
had current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities of
approximately $55.9 million and $5.6 million,
respectively.

Product shipments, including those for
demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not
recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master
agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices.
Revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms
or if collectibility is not reasonably assured. The
Company’s method of revenue recognition for certain
products requiring installation is in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.” Accordingly, the
larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the
installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and
revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when
installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value
of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly
service billing rates, installation hours and amounts charged by
third parties. The Company believes that this amount
approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the
installation effort.

Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and
Inventory:

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
its customers to make required payments. If the financial
condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments,
additional allowances may be required. The Company does not
request collateral from its customers but collectibility is
enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of
credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of
factors including, but not limited to, past transaction history
with the customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer,
independent credit reports, industry trends and the
macro-economic environment. Sales returns and allowances are
estimates of future product returns related to current period
revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and
timing of revenue for any period if management made different
judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and
allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company’s accounts
receivable balance at December 31, 2003 was
$214.3 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and
sales returns of $5.6 million. Historically, the Company
has not experienced significant bad debt losses.



The Company values all of its inventories at the
lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis
(“FIFO”). The Company estimates revisions to its
inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical
demand, projections of future demand including that in the
Company’s current backlog of orders, and industry and
market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions
are less favorable than those projected by management,
additional write-downs may be required. The Company’s
inventory balance at December 31, 2003 was
$128.8 million, net of write-downs to net realizable value
of $15.1 million.

Valuation of Equity Investments:

The Company holds minority equity interests in
companies having operations or technology in areas within its
strategic focus, some of which are publicly traded and have
highly volatile share prices. For investments where a company is
not publicly traded, the Company obtains and reviews quarterly
and annual financial statements and progress of technological
expectations. The Company records an investment impairment
charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline
in value that is other-than-temporary. Future adverse changes in
market conditions or poor operating results of underlying
investments could result in losses or an inability to recover
the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected
in an investment’s current carrying value, thereby possibly
requiring an impairment charge in the future. In the fourth
quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a $0.3 million charge
to other expense, in the consolidated statements of operations,
for the impairment of certain equity investments. At
December 31, 2003, the Company had equity investments
totaling $18.2 million included in other assets on the
balance sheet.

Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and
Goodwill:

The Company assesses the impairment of
identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related goodwill
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company
considers important which could trigger an impairment review
include but are not limited to the following:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected
    historical or projected future operating results;

•

significant negative industry or economic
    trends; and

•

significant changes or developments in strategic
    technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the
    Company’s capitalized patent, trademark and intellectual
    properties such as licenses.

When the Company determines that the carrying
value of intangibles, long-lived assets and related goodwill may
not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of
the above indicators, it measures any impairment based on a
projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate
determined by management to be commensurate with the risk
inherent in the Company’s current business model. Net
intangible assets, long-lived assets, and goodwill amounted to
$376.9 million as of December 31, 2003. In 2002,
SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, became
effective and as a result, the Company ceased amortization of
approximately $163.5 million of goodwill as of
December 31, 2001. The Company had recorded approximately
$4.0 million of amortization on these amounts during 2001.
In lieu of amortization, the Company is required to perform
annual impairment reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed
its annual review during 2003 and currently does not expect to
record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. However,
there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are
completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded.

Warranty:

Product warranties are recorded at the time
revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the
Company engages in extensive product quality programs and
processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the
quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty
obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage
and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product
failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or
service delivery costs differ from the Company’s previous
estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would
be required. At December 31, 2003, the Company’s
warranty liability was $11.1 million.



Income Taxes:

As part of the process of preparing the
consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to
estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which
it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its
actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary
differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as
depreciation, amortization, and inventory reserves, for tax and
accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which are included within the
consolidated balance sheets. The Company must then assess the
likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from
future taxable income and, to the extent it believes that
recovery is not likely, the Company must establish a valuation
allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these
estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future
periods, the Company may need to establish an additional
valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial
position and results of operations.

The Company has realized significant income tax
benefits associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock
options. The corresponding credit was to additional
paid-in-capital. Because of the outstanding stock options, the
Company believes that it is more likely than not that the
U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, a
valuation allowance has reduced to zero all the deferred tax
assets relating to U.S. income.

Litigation:

As described in Item 3 of this
Form 10-K, the Company is a party to various pending
litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim,
management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether
a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss.
If and when management has determined, with respect to a
particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can
reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records
a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the
lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will
disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject
to considerable interpretation.

With respect to the claims referenced in
Item 3, management of the Company to date has been able to
make both of these determinations, and thus has recorded charges
with respect to the claims described under the headings
“Applera Corporation” and “Hewlett-Packard
Company.” As developments occur in these matters and
additional information becomes available, management of the
Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their
range, which may result in its recording charges or additional
charges, which could materially impact the Company’s
results of operation or financial position.

Recent Accounting Standards Changes

In December 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued revised FASB Statement
No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits.” The revised standard
provides additional required disclosures for pensions and other
postretirement benefit plans and is designed to improve
disclosure transparency in financial statements. The revised
standard replaces existing pension disclosure requirements. The
revised SFAS 132 is effective, with some exceptions, for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003.

In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition”, which supersedes SAB No. 101,
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” SAB
No. 104 rescinds accounting guidance in SAB No. 101
related to multiple-element arrangements as this guidance has
been superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21,
“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.” The adoption of SAB No. 104 did not
have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” This
interpretation clarifies the application of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial
Statements,” relating to consolidation of certain entities.
FIN 46 requires identification of the Company’s
participation in variable interest entities (“VIE”),
which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity
that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them
to operate on a stand alone basis, or whose equity



holders lack certain characteristics of a
controlling financial interest. For entities identified as a
VIE, FIN 46 sets forth a model to evaluate potential
consolidation based on an assessment of which party to the VIE,
if any, bears a majority of the risk to its expected losses, or
stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns.
FIN 46 applies immediately to VIEs created or acquired
after January 31, 2003. The Company has not invested in any
variable interest in any VIEs subsequent to January 31,
2003. FIN 46 also sets forth certain disclosures regarding
interests in VIE’s that are deemed significant, even if
consolidation is not required. The application of FIN 46
did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to
FIN 46 (“FIN 46R”) to address various
technical corrections and implementation issues that have arisen
since its issuance. The provisions of FIN 46R are effective
for financial periods ending after March 15, 2004, thus the
Company will implement the new provisions effective
March 31, 2004. As FIN 46R was recently issued and
contains provisions that the accounting profession continues to
analyze, the Company’s assessment of the impact of
FIN 46R on all VIEs with which it is involved is ongoing.
However, at this time and based on management’s current
interpretation, the Company does not believe that the
implementation of FIN 46R will have a material impact on
the Company’s Consolidated financial statements, earnings
or capital resources.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.” SFAS 150 established standards for how to
classify and measure certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The provisions
of SFAS 150 were effective for financial instruments
entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. The
application of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on
the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” SFAS 149 amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” The changes in SFAS 149 improve financial
reporting by requiring that contracts with similar
characteristics be accounted for similarly. SFAS 149 is
effective, with some exceptions, for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003. The application of
SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) reached a consensus on EITF Issue 00-21,
“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.” EITF Issue 00-21 provides guidance on
how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple
revenue-generating activities or deliverables should be divided
into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition
purposes, and if this division is required, how the arrangement
consideration should be allocated among the separate units of
accounting. The guidance in the consensus is effective for
revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF Issue 00-21 did
not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 7a:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to financial risk in
several areas including changes in foreign exchange rates and
interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures
by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than
trading, in accordance with the Company’s overall risk
management guidelines. Further information regarding the
Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments and
disclosures of financial instruments can be found in
Notes 2 and 10 to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Foreign Exchange

The Company has operations in various countries
and currencies throughout the world, with approximately 29% of
its sales denominated in Euros, 9% in Yen and smaller sales
exposures in other currencies. As a result, the Company’s
financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be
affected by fluctuations in foreign



currency exchange rates. The Company uses debt
swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts to
partially mitigate such effects, and these agreements are
designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in
foreign operations. The debt swap agreements effectively swap
higher U.S. dollar variable rate borrowings for lower
variable rate borrowings denominated in the respective
currencies. During 2003, the Company opened and subsequently
closed debt swap agreements in Japanese yen. In December 2003,
the Company entered into new debt swap agreements in Japanese
yen, with notional amounts totaling $25.0 million, with
terms of three months and an interest rate of 0.06%. For the
year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded
cumulative net pre-tax gains of $1.6 million in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), which consisted of realized
gains of $1.3 million relating to the closed debt swap
agreements and unrealized gains of $0.3 million relating to
the Japanese yen swap agreements, both of which partially offset
hedged foreign exchange impacts. At December 31, 2002, the
Company held debt swap agreements in Japanese yen with notional
amounts totaling $25.0 million, with terms of three months
and an interest rate of 0.07%. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company recorded cumulative net
pre-tax gains of $1.0 million in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), which consisted of realized losses
of $1.4 million and unrealized gains of $0.4 million.

During 2003, the Company also opened forward
foreign exchange contracts in British pounds. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Company recorded realized losses of
$3.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) relating to forward foreign exchange contracts in British
pounds that were entered in to and closed in 2003. As of
December 31, 2003, the Company had no open forward foreign
exchange contracts in British pounds. At December 31, 2002,
the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts in British
pounds with notional amounts totaling $40.0 million and
terms of forty-five days. For the year ended December 31,
2002, the Company recorded unrealized gains of $0.3 million
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to
these forward foreign exchange contracts.

Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in
year-end exchange rates (a weakening of the U.S. dollar),
the fair market value of the debt swap agreements as of
December 31, 2003 would decrease by $2.5 million.

The Company also enters into forward foreign
exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency
fluctuations on certain intercompany balances. Principal hedged
currencies include the Euro and British pound. The periods of
these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be
consistent with changes in intercompany balances. Gains and
losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statement of operations. At December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, the Company held forward foreign
exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately
$32.0 million and $69.0 million, respectively.

Interest Rates

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest
rate fluctuations when borrowing in connection with its credit
agreement. As a result, the Company may periodically attempt to
minimize its interest rate exposures by using certain financial
instruments such as interest swap agreements for purposes other
than trading. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were no
outstanding interest swap agreements.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest
rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from
operations. The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly
liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or
less, in repurchase agreements and money market funds. Cash
equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry
an insignificant risk of change in value. The Company
periodically maintained balances in various operating accounts
in excess of federally insured limits.



Item 8:

Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data

Report of Independent Auditors

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Waters Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Waters Corporation and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the accompanying
financial statement schedule presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for patent related costs in 2002. Also discussed in
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill to conform
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” in 2002.

Description of Business, Organization and
    Basis of Presentation

Waters Corporation (“Waters” or the
“Company”), an analytical instrument manufacturer,
manufactures and distributes, through its Waters Division, high
performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”)
instruments, chromatography columns and other consumables, and
related service, as well as mass spectrometry (“MS”)
instruments, which are complementary products that can be
integrated and used along with other analytical instruments,
especially HPLC. HPLC, the largest product segment of the
analytical instrument market, is utilized in a broad range of
industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the
chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and
to purify a full range of compounds. MS instruments are used in
drug discovery and development, including clinical trial
testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as
“proteomics”) and environmental testing. Through its
TA Instruments Division (“TAI”), the Company designs,
manufactures and sells thermal analysis and rheology instruments
which are used in predicting the suitability of polymers and
viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
health care products. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2003,
the Company completed the integration of the HPLC and MS
worldwide sales, service and support organizations. Accordingly,
the Micromass operating segment (“Micromass”) has been
integrated into the Waters operating segment. As discussed in
Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company has two operating segments, Waters Division and TAI,
which have been aggregated into one reporting segment for
financial statement purposes.


Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
liabilities. On an on-going basis, Waters evaluates its
estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,
product returns and allowances, bad debts, inventory valuation,
equity investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income
taxes, warranty and installation provisions, contingencies and
litigation. Waters bases its estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

Risks and Uncertainties

The Company is subject to risks common to
companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but
not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of
new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel,
protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with
regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies.

Reclassification

Certain amounts from prior years have been
reclassified in the accompanying financial statements in order
to be consistent with the current year’s classifications.
In particular, the Company reclassified field service expenses
associated with service revenues from selling, general and
administrative expenses to cost of sales in 2002. For the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 the amount of costs
reclassified to cost of sales were $58.4 million and
$50.7 million, respectively, and the gross profit as a
percentage of sales decreased 6.6% and 5.9%, for each period.
This change was primarily a result of the integration of the
Company’s HPLC and MS worldwide sales, service and support
organizations and to align the Company’s reporting with the
majority of other companies in the same industry. In the first
quarter of 2003, the Company reclassified all MS and thermal
analysis demonstration (“demo”) inventory from
property, plant and equipment, net, to inventories.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2002 the amount of demo
inventory reclassified to inventories was $18.7 million.
The primary reason for this change was to consistently classify
demo inventory across product lines.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are
wholly owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns
or controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All
material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.

Translation of Foreign Currencies

For most of the Company’s foreign
operations, assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance
sheet date while revenues and expenses are translated at average
exchange rates prevailing during the period. Any resulting
translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company’s net sales derived from operations outside the
United States were 55% in 2003, 62% in 2002 and 57% in 2001.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included
in net income in the consolidated statements of operations and
were not material for the years presented.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents primarily represent highly
liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or
less, in repurchase agreements and money market funds which are
convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant
risk of change in value. The Company has periodically maintained
balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally
insured limits.

Restricted Cash

At December 31, 2002, restricted cash was
$49.9 million, which represented credit support for a
standby letter of credit issued securing damages awarded plus
interest with respect to the Applera patent litigation
(Note 12). In April 2003, the Company made a payment of
$53.7 million for damages and interest relating to this
patent litigation and, as a result, the Company is no longer
required to maintain a restricted cash balance.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company sells its products and services to a
significant number of large and small customers throughout the
world, with net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of
approximately 53% in 2003, 57% in 2002 and 63% in 2001. None of
the Company’s individual customers accounted for more than
3% of annual Company sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001. The Company
performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral, but in certain
circumstances may require letters of credit or deposits.
Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad
debt losses.

Inventory

The Company values all of its inventories at the
lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis
(“FIFO”).

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for
temporary differences between financial statement and income tax
basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for
the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax
assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at
cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense while the costs of significant improvements are
capitalized. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line
method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings and
improvements — thirty years, leasehold
improvements — the shorter of fifteen years or life of
lease, and production and other equipment — three to
ten years. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets
disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the balance sheet and related gains or losses
are reflected in the statement of operations.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company
adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” and no longer amortizes goodwill. Under the
transition provisions of SFAS 142, there was no goodwill
impairment at January 1, 2002. The Company tests for
goodwill impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting
unit level annually, or earlier if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Additionally, the Company has elected to make January 1 the
annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units.
SFAS 142 defines a reporting unit as an operating segment,
or one level below an operating segment, if discrete financial
information is prepared and reviewed by management. Goodwill is
allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition.
Under the impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying
amount exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill
exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value
of reporting units were estimated using a discounted cash flows
technique which includes certain management assumptions such as
estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and discount
rates. During fiscal year 2001, goodwill was amortized on a
straight-line basis.

For the year ended December 31, 2001 the
Company’s goodwill amortization expense was approximately
$4.0 million. Goodwill amortization expense per basic
common share and per diluted common share for the year ended
December 31, 2001 would have been $0.03. Pro forma net
income for the year ended December 31, 2001 would have been
$117.6 million, excluding goodwill amortization expense at
the Company’s effective tax rate of 24%. Reported net
income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was
$114.5 million. Pro forma net income per basic common share
and pro forma net income per diluted common share for the year
ended December 31, 2001 would have been $0.90 and $0.85,
respectively. Reported net income per basic common share and net
income per diluted common share for the year ended
December 31, 2001 was $0.88 and $0.83, respectively.

The Company’s intangible assets include
purchased technology, capitalized software development costs, as
discussed below, costs associated with acquiring Company
patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as
licenses, and debt issuance costs. Purchased intangibles are
recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisition date
and amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from two
to fifteen years. Other intangibles are amortized over a period
ranging from three to fifteen years. Debt issuance costs are
amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective
interest method.

Software Development Costs

The Company capitalizes software development
costs for products offered for sale in accordance with
SFAS 86. Capitalized costs are amortized to cost of sales
over the period of economic benefit, which approximates a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
related software products, generally three to five years.

The Company capitalizes internal software
development costs in accordance with Statement of Position
(“SOP”) 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
Capitalized internal software development costs are amortized
over the period of economic benefit which



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximates a straight-line basis over ten
years. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
capitalized internal software included in property, plant and
equipment totaled $1.7 million and $2.1 million net of
accumulated amortization of $2.1 million and
$1.7 million respectively.

Change in Accounting for Patent Related
Costs

In the second quarter of 2002, the Company
changed its method of accounting for legal costs associated with
litigating patents effective January 1, 2002. Prior to the
change, the Company capitalized these patent costs and amortized
them over the estimated remaining economic life of the patent.
Under the new method, these costs are expensed as incurred. The
Company believes that this change is preferable because it will
provide a better comparison with the Company’s industry
peers, the majority of which expense these costs as incurred.
The $4.5 million cumulative effect of the change on prior
years (after reduction for income taxes of $1.3 million) is
included as a charge to net income as of January 1, 2002.
The effect of the change for the year ended December 31,
2002 was to decrease income before cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle approximately $2.8 million or
$0.02 per diluted share and net income $7.3 million or
$0.05 per diluted share.

Pro forma net income for the year ended
December 31, 2001 would have been $112.5 million had
the change in accounting for patent related costs occurred at
the beginning of 2001. Reported net income for the year ended
December 31, 2001 was $114.5 million. Pro forma net
income per basic common share and pro forma net income per
diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2001
would have been $0.86 and $0.82, respectively. Reported net
income per basic common share and net income per diluted common
share for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $0.88 and
$0.83, respectively. The pro forma amounts reflect the effect of
retroactive application of this change had the new method been
in effect for all periods presented.

Investments

The Company accounts for its investments that
represent less than twenty percent ownership using
SFAS 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities.” This standard requires that certain
debt and equity securities be adjusted to market value at the
end of each accounting period. Unrealized market gains and
losses are charged to earnings if the securities are traded for
short-term profit. Otherwise, these securities are considered
available-for-sale investments and unrealized gains and losses
are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (loss) in
stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of
investments are included in the consolidated statements of
operations.

Investments for which the Company does not have
the ability to exercise significant influence and for which
there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. The Company
periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments
accounted for under the cost method of accounting and carries
them at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. For
investments in which the Company owns or controls between twenty
and forty-nine percent of the voting shares, or over which it
exerts significant influence over operating and financial
policies, the equity method of accounting is used. The
Company’s share of net income or losses of equity
investments is included in the consolidated statements of
operations and was not material in any period presented. All
investments at December 31, 2003 and 2002 are included in
other assets.

Asset Impairments

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for
impairment in accordance with SFAS 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
Whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates
the fair value of the asset, relying on a number of factors
including but not limited to operating results, business plans,
economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. Any
change in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of the
Company’s evaluation is separately identified in the
consolidated statements of operations.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stockholders’ Equity

On August 9, 2002, the Board of Directors
approved the adoption of a stock purchase rights plan where a
dividend of one fractional preferred share purchase right (a
“Right”) was declared for each outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company.
The dividend was paid on August 27, 2002 to the
stockholders of record on that date. The Rights, which expire on
August 27, 2012, become exercisable only under certain
conditions. When they first become exercisable, each Right will
entitle its holder to buy from Waters one one-hundredth of a
share of new Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
(authorized limit of 4,000) for $120.00. When a person or group
actually has acquired 15% or more of Waters’ common stock,
the Rights will then become exercisable for a number of shares
of Waters’ common stock with a market value of twice the
exercise price ($120.00) of each Right. In addition, the Rights
will then become exercisable for a number of shares of common
stock of the acquiring company with a market value of twice the
exercise price per Right. The Board of Directors may redeem the
Rights at a price of $0.001 per Right up until 10 days
following a public announcement that any person or group has
acquired 15% or more of the Company’s common stock.

On June 25, 2002, the Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $200 million of
its outstanding common shares over a one-year period. During the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company
purchased 4,399 shares of its common stock for
$100.6 million and 4,078 shares of its common stock
for $99.3 million, respectively. The total shares purchased
under this program were 8,477 thus completing its
$200.0 million stock buyback program.

On May 6, 2003, the Company’s Board of
Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to
$400 million of its outstanding common shares over a
two-year period. During the year ended December 31, 2003,
the Company purchased 7,540 shares of its common stock for
$224.0 million. At December 31, 2003, the Company had
borrowings outstanding under its credit facility of
$236.5 million principally to finance share repurchases.

In the aggregate, the Company has repurchased
11,939 shares of its common stock for $324.6 million
during the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company’s
share repurchase program is beneficial to shareholders by
increasing earnings per share via reducing the outstanding
number of shares through open market purchases.

Hedge Transactions

The Company records its hedge transactions in
accordance with SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended, which
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives,
whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required
to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either
assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair
value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and
of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a
cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair
value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive
income (“OCI”) and are recognized in earnings when the
hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in
fair value are recognized in earnings.

The Company currently uses derivative instruments
to manage exposures to foreign currency risks. The
Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to
minimize foreign currency risk using the most effective methods
to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency exposure.
The Company documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, and links all derivatives
designated as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges to
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to
specific forecasted transactions. The Company also assesses and
documents, both at the hedges’ inception and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has operations in various countries
and currencies throughout the world. As a result, the
Company’s financial position, results of operations and
cash flows are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. The Company uses debt swap agreements and
forward foreign exchange contracts to partially mitigate such
effects, and these agreements are designated as foreign currency
hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. The debt swap
agreements effectively swap higher U.S. dollar variable
rate borrowings for lower variable rate borrowings denominated
in the respective currencies. During 2003 and 2002, the Company
opened and subsequently closed debt swap agreements in Japanese
yen. In December 2003, the Company entered into new debt swap
agreements in Japanese yen with notional amounts totaling
$25.0 million, with terms of three months and an interest
rate of 0.06%. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
$1.6 million in OCI, which consisted of realized gains of
$1.3 million relating to the closed debt swap agreements
and unrealized gains of $0.3 million relating to the
Japanese yen swap agreements, both of which partially offset
hedged foreign exchange impacts. At December 31, 2002, the
Company held debt swap agreements in Japanese yen with notional
amounts totaling $25.0 million, with terms of three months
and an interest rate of 0.07%. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company recorded cumulative net
pre-tax gains of $1.0 million in OCI, which consisted of
realized losses of $1.4 million and unrealized gains of
$0.4 million. At December 31, 2001, the Company held
debt swap agreements in Japanese yen with notional amounts
totaling $27.0 million, with terms of three months and an
interest rate of 0.15%. For the year ended December 31,
2001, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
$7.8 million in OCI, which consisted of realized gains of
$6.8 million and unrealized gains of $1.0 million. In
December 2002, the Company opened forward foreign exchange
contracts in British pounds with notional amounts totaling
$40.0 million and terms of forty-five days. For the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded
realized losses of $3.3 million and unrealized gains of
$0.3 million, respectively, in OCI relating to these
forward foreign exchange contracts.

The Company also enters into forward foreign
exchange contracts, not designated as cash flow hedging
instruments under SFAS 133, principally to hedge the impact
of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances.
Principal hedged currencies include the euro and British pound.
The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one
to three months and have varying notional amounts which are
intended to be consistent with changes in intercompany balances.
Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations. Foreign currency gains and losses from
currency fluctuations on intercompany balances and these forward
contracts were $3.4 million in 2003 and not material for
2002 and 2001. At December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with
notional amounts totaling approximately $32.0 million and
$69.0 million, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Sales of products and services are generally
recorded based on product shipment and performance of service,
respectively. Product shipments, including those for
demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not
recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master
agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices.
Proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance
of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated
balance sheets. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost
of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order.

The Company’s method of revenue recognition
for certain products requiring installation is in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104,
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.”
Accordingly, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the
fair value of the installation service is deferred when the
product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple
element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company
determines the fair value of installation based on several
factors, including hourly service, billing rates, installation
hours and amounts charged by third parties.

The Company recognizes product revenue when legal
title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer.
The Company generally structures its sales arrangements as FOB
shipping point or international



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

equivalent and accordingly, recognizes revenue
upon shipment. In some cases, FOB destination based shipping
terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases revenue
is recognized when the products arrive at the customer site.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and
recorded as a reduction to sales. Rights of return are generally
not included in sales arrangements. Revenue associated with
products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria is
not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria is
satisfied. Discounts from list prices are recorded as a
reduction to sales.

Nearly all of the Company’s instruments
contain embedded operating system and data management software,
which is included in the purchase price. Software is also sold
separately and revenue is recognized upon shipment under the
provisions of SOP 97-2, “Software Revenue
Recognition,” as no significant post-delivery obligations
remain. Software upgrades are typically sold as part of a
service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term
of the service contract.

The Company assists customers in obtaining
financing with an independent third-party leasing company with
respect to certain product sales. Revenue is generally
recognized upon product shipment under these arrangements. The
Company receives payment from the leasing company shortly after
shipment, provided delivery and credit documentation meets
contractual criteria. The customer is obligated to pay the
leasing company but Waters retains some credit risk if the
customer is unable to pay. Accordingly, the Company reduces
revenue equal to pre-established loss-pool criteria, including
contracts with recourse. Waters credit risk is significantly
reduced through loss-pool limitations and re-marketing rights in
the event of a default.

Product Warranty Costs

The Company accrues estimated product warranty
costs at the time of sale which are included in cost of sales in
the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its
component supplies, the Company warranty obligation is affected
by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery
costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of
the accrued warranty liability is based on historical
information such as past experience, product failure rates,
number of units repaired and estimated cost of material and
labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least
quarterly.

The following is a rollforward of the
Company’s accrued warranty liability for the year ended
December 31, 2003 (in thousands):

Advertising Costs

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred
and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in
the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expenses
for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $9.6 million,
$8.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are comprised
of costs incurred in performing research and development
activities including salaries and benefits, facilities costs,
overhead costs, contract services and other outside costs.
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.

Expensed In-Process Research and Developments
Expenses

Costs to acquire in-process research and
development (“IPR&D”) projects and technologies,
which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of
acquisition and have no alternative future use, are expensed as
incurred (see Note 7).

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has five stock-based compensation
plans, which are described in Note 16. The Company uses the
intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees,” and related interpretations, including
Interpretation 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock Compensation,” for its plans. Accordingly,
no compensation expense has been recognized for its fixed
employee stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan
since all stock based compensation awards are granted at the
current fair value of the Company’s common stock as of the
date of the award

.

The following table illustrates the effect on net
income and earnings per share had the Company applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for the
Company’s five stock-based compensation plans.

The fair value of each option grant under
SFAS 123 was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Relevant data are described
below (options issued are in thousands):

Income Per Share

In accordance with SFAS 128, “Earnings
Per Share,” the Company presents two earnings per share
(“EPS”) amounts. Income per basic common share is
based on income available to common shareholders and the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
periods presented. Income per diluted common share includes
additional dilution from potential common stock, such as stock
issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding.

Comprehensive Income

The Company accounts for comprehensive income in
accordance with SFAS 130, “Reporting Comprehensive
Income.” The statement establishes standards for reporting
and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full
set of general-purpose financial statements. The statement
requires that all components of comprehensive income be reported
in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
prominence as other financial statements.

Recent Accounting Standards Changes

In December 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued revised FASB Statement
No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits.” The revised standard
provides additional required disclosures for pensions and other
postretirement benefit plans and is designed to improve
disclosure transparency in financial statements. The revised
standard replaces existing pension disclosure requirements. The
revised SFAS 132 is effective, with some exceptions, for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. It does not
change the measurement or recognition of those plans.

In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition”, which supersedes SAB No. 101,
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” SAB
No. 104 rescinds accounting guidance in SAB No. 101
related to multiple-element arrangements as this guidance has
been superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21,
“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.” The adoption of SAB No. 104 did not
have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretations (“FIN”) No. 46
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
interpretation of ARB 51.” FIN No. 46 provides
guidance on the identification of entities for which control is
achieved through means other than through voting rights called
“variable interest entities” or “VIEs” and
how to determine when and which business enterprise should
consolidate the VIE (the “primary beneficiary”). This
new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either
(1) the equity investors (if any) do not have a controlling
financial interest or (2) the equity investment at risk is
insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without
receiving additional subordinated financial support from other
parties. In addition, FIN No. 46 requires that both the
primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant
variable interest in a VIE make additional disclosures. The
adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have a material impact on
our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to
FIN 46 (“FIN 46R”) to address various
technical corrections and implementation issues that have arisen
since its issuance. The provisions of FIN 46R are effective
for financial periods ending after March 15, 2004, thus the
Company will implement the new provisions effective
March 31, 2004. As FIN 46R was recently issued and
contains provisions that the accounting profession continues to
analyze, the Company’s assessment of the impact of
FIN 46R on all VIEs with which it is involved is ongoing.
However, at this time and based on management’s current
interpretation, the Company does not believe that the
implementation of FIN 46R will have a material impact on
the Company’s Consolidated financial statements, earnings
or capital resources.

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”
SFAS 150 established standards for how to classify and
measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. The provisions of SFAS 150
were effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003. The application of
SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” SFAS 149 amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

under SFAS 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The changes
in SFAS 149 improve financial reporting by requiring that
contracts with similar characteristics be accounted for
similarly. SFAS 149 is effective, with some exceptions, for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The
application of SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on
the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) reached a consensus on EITF Issue 00-21,
“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.” EITF Issue 00-21 provides guidance on how to
determine when an arrangement that involves multiple
revenue-generating activities or deliverables should be divided
into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition
purposes, and if this division is required, how the arrangement
consideration should be allocated among the separate units of
accounting. The guidance in the consensus is effective for
revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF Issue 00-21 did
not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Investments

In November 2000 and February 2002, the Company
made minority equity investments in
GeneProt

TM

, Inc. (“GeneProt”), a
privately held company, of $3.6 million and
$10.0 million, respectively. The investment in GeneProt is
accounted for under the cost method of accounting. To the
Company’s knowledge, due to changes in GeneProt’s
ability to generate enough commercial interest to expand its
business in the U.S. market, the Company recorded pre-tax
charges of $12.6 million to other income (expense) in
the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended
December, 31, 2002, for an other-than-temporary impairment
of its investment in GeneProt. The investment in GeneProt was
approximately $1.0 million at December 31, 2003 and
2002, and is included in other assets. In connection with
GeneProt’s canceled order of up to $20.0 million



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of mass spectrometry equipment, related systems
and services, the Company received approximately
$7.7 million from GeneProt as a cancellation fee, which is
recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated
statements of operations for the year ended December 31,
2002.

In June 2000, the Company formed a strategic
alliance with Variagenics, Inc. (“Variagenics”),
a publicly traded company, to develop and commercialize genetic
variance reagent kits for use in the clinical development of
pharmaceutical products. Variagenics was considered a leader in
applying genetic variance information to the drug development
process. In July 2000, the Company paid Variagenics
$7.5 million for a minority common stock equity ownership
and $3.0 million for a license to manufacture and sell
reagents, and warrants to purchase common stock. The warrants to
purchase Variagenics common stock are exercisable at
$14 per share for a period of 5 years. The warrants
were valued at approximately $0.7 million using the
Black-Scholes model. The investment in Variagenics is included
in other assets and carried at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses reported as a separate component of other
comprehensive income (loss). During 2002 and 2001, the Company
recorded a $1.0 million and $6.4 million charge,
respectively, to other income (expense), in the consolidated
statements of operations, for an other than temporary impairment
of the equity investment and warrants resulting from Variagenics
public stock price declines. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the
license with Variagenics described above was deemed fully
impaired as the technology collaboration program ceased, and the
Company abandoned the technology and the Company recorded a
$2.4 million charge to impairment of long-lived intangible
asset in the consolidated statements of operations. The license
was being amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful
life of 15 years. On January 31, 2003 Variagenics was
merged with Hyseq Pharmaceuticals and is now named
Nuvelo, Inc. (“Nuvelo”). The carrying amount,
which approximates market value, of the investment was
approximately $3.2 million and $0.8 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Other minority equity investments made during
2003 and 2002 were $1.8 million and $4.5 million,
respectively. Excluding the effects of currency, sales to these
entities during 2003 and 2002 were approximately
$1.4 million and $7.0 million, respectively.

During 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded a
$0.3 million and $0.1 million charge, respectively, to
other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of
operations for the impairment of certain other equity
investments. At December 31, 2003, no other investments and
long-lived assets were determined to be impaired.

6     Acquisitions

Creon:

In July 2003, the Company acquired, effective
July 1, 2003, all of the capital stock of Creon, a Company
headquartered in Cologne, Germany, for approximately
$16.3 million in cash. Creon specializes in Laboratory
Information Management Software (“LIMS”) solutions.

The acquisition of Creon was accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations
of Creon have been included in the consolidated results of the
Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the
acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and
assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. In
conjunction with the acquisition, the Company recorded a charge
of $6.0 million for the write-off of acquired in-process
research and development. The technological feasibility of
in-process research and development projects had not been
established at the date of acquisition and they had no
alternative future use. The Company has allocated
$4.4 million of the purchase price to intangible assets
comprised of customer lists and other purchased intangibles. The
excess purchase price of $5.6 million after this allocation
has been accounted for as goodwill.

The following represents the pro forma results of
the ongoing operations for Waters and Creon as though the
acquisition of Creon had occurred at the beginning of each
period shown (in thousands, except per share data). The pro
forma results exclude expensed in-process research and
development. The pro forma

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

information however, is not necessarily
indicative of the results that would have resulted had the
acquisition occurred at the beginning of the periods presented,
nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.

The Company considered a number of factors to
determine the purchase price allocation, including engaging a
third party valuation firm to independently appraise the fair
value of certain assets acquired. The following table presents
the fair values of assets and liabilities recorded in connection
with the Creon acquisition (in thousands):

Rheometrics:

On January 15, 2003, the Company acquired
the worldwide rheology business of Rheometrics for approximately
$16.5 million in cash. This transaction was accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting and the results of
operations of Rheometrics have been included in the consolidated
results of the Company from the acquisition date. This business
has been integrated into existing worldwide TAI operations. The
purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to tangible and
intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their
estimated fair values. The Company has allocated
$5.5 million of the purchase price to intangible



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

assets comprised of customer lists, trademarks
and other purchased intangibles. The excess purchase price of
$15.0 million after this allocation has been accounted for
as goodwill.

The Company considered a number of factors to
determine the purchase price allocation, including engaging a
third party valuation firm to independently appraise the fair
value of certain assets acquired. The following table presents
the fair values of assets and liabilities recorded in connection
with the Rheometrics acquisition (in thousands):

The Company recorded approximately
$4.1 million in purchase accounting liabilities relating to
the Rheometrics acquisition. The purchase accounting liabilities
included $1.2 million for severance costs for approximately
65 employees, of which 64 employees were terminated as of
December 31, 2003, and $0.9 million in facilities
related costs for three facilities, all of which have been
closed as of December 31, 2003.

The following is a rollforward of the Rheometrics
acquisition schedule of amounts accrued under purchase
accounting and related utilization (in thousands):

Korea:

In February 2003, the Company acquired the
remaining 30% of its Korean distributor for approximately
$2.5 million. The Company now owns 100% of its Korean
distributor. The purchase price of the acquisition has been
allocated to goodwill.

The pro forma effects of the Rheometrics and
Korea acquisitions are immaterial.

During 2002 and 2001, the Company made business
acquisitions totaling $5.9 million and $2.6 million,
respectively. The business acquisitions were accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations
of the acquired companies have been included in the consolidated
results of the Company from the acquisition date. The purchase
price of the acquisitions have been allocated to tangible and
intangible



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

assets and any assumed liabilities based on
respective fair market values. Any excess purchase price after
this allocation has been accounted for as goodwill. With respect
to the 2002 acquisitions, the Company allocated approximately
$2.6 million of the purchase price to customer contracts
and non-compete covenants. Fixed assets and intangible assets
are being amortized over their expected useful lives.

7     Expensed
In-Process Research and Development

In connection with the acquisition of Creon, the
Company wrote-off the fair value of purchased IPR&D of
various projects for the development of new products and
technologies in the amount of $6.0 million. The amount was
determined by identifying research projects for which
technological feasibility had not been established and had no
alternative future uses. As of the acquisition date, there were
four projects that met the above criteria. The significant
IPR&D projects identified consist of the E Lab notebook
and the automatic LC-MS dereplication system. The IPR&D
charges associated with these projects were $4.5 million
and $0.8 million, respectively.

Management determined the valuation of the
IPR&D using a number of factors, including engaging a third
party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal. The
value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method.
This valuation included consideration of (i) the stage of
completion of each of the projects, (ii) the technological
feasibility of each of the projects, (iii) whether the
projects had an alternative future use, and (iv) the
estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated
from the various projects and technologies over their respective
projected economic lives.

The primary basis for determining the
technological feasibility of these projects was whether the
product has met predetermined design specifications and complex
functionality. As of the acquisition date, the IPR&D
projects had not reached predetermined design specifications and
complex functionality. In assessing the technological
feasibility of a project, consideration was also given to the
level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each
project had to overcome.

Future residual cash flows that could be
generated from each of the projects were determined based upon
management’s estimate of future revenue and expected
profitability of the various products and technologies involved.
These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present
values taking into account management’s estimate of future
expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to
completion. The discount rates include a rate of return, which
accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors
that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may
not be realized. The cash flows were discounted at discount
rates ranging from 55% to 60% per annum, depending on the
project’s stage of completion and the type of complex
functionality needed. This discounted cash flow methodology for
the various projects included in the purchased IPR&D
resulted in a total valuation of $6.0 million. Although
work on the projects related to the IPR&D continued after
the acquisition, the amount of the purchase price allocated to
IPR&D was written off because the projects underlying the
IPR&D that was being developed were not considered
technologically feasible as of the acquisition date. As of
December 31, 2003, the IPR&D projects still had not
reached technological feasibility. The expected remaining costs
to complete these projects are not considered material to the
Company and there are currently no expected material variations
between projected results from the projects versus those at the
time of the acquisition. The Company expects the projects to be
completed within the next twelve months.

8     Divestiture of
Business

On March 26, 2003, the Company sold the net
assets of its mass spectrometry inorganic product line for
approximately $1.2 million in cash and the balance in notes
receivable. Assets sold included inventory and certain accounts
receivable, and liabilities assumed by the acquirer consisted of
deferred service revenue and advance payment obligations, and
warranty and installation obligations. The Company recorded a
loss on



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

disposal of approximately $5.0 million,
including severance costs of approximately $0.3 million.
This business generated sales of approximately
$14.0 million per year with no significant effects to
earnings per share results.

9     Goodwill and
Other Intangibles

The carrying amount of goodwill was
$196.6 million and $167.9 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase of $28.7 million
is attributable to the Company’s three acquisitions
(Note 6) during the period of approximately
$23.1 million and currency translation adjustments of
approximately $5.6 million.

The Company’s intangible assets included in
the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (in
thousands):

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company retired approximately $4.4 million in fully
amortized purchased intangibles and $3.7 million in fully
amortized other intangibles, that were no longer in use.

For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001 amortization expense for intangible assets was
$11.9 million, $11.2 million, and $13.3 million,
respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is
estimated to be approximately $12.5 million for each of the
next five years. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, intangible
assets above reflect the change in accounting for patent related
costs as discussed in Note 2.

10     Debt

In February 2002, the Company entered into an
agreement (“Credit Agreement”) that provided for a
$250.0 million line of credit, unsecured in nature and an
expiration date in February 2007. Loans under the Credit
Agreement bore interest for each calendar quarter at an annual
rate equal to, at the Company’s option, 1) the
applicable LIBOR rate plus a varying margin between 0.60% and
1.50% or 2) prime rate.

In December 2003, the Company amended its
existing $250.0 million Credit Agreement (“Amended
Credit Agreement”) dated February 2002 by closing on a
$125.0 million Add-On Term Loan Facility (“Term
Loan”). Proceeds from the Term Loan will be used to repay
borrowings under the Credit Agreement, repurchase stock and for
general corporate purposes. The applicable interest changed from
being based on the ratio of debt to total capitalization to debt
to EBITDA. Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear
interest for each quarter at a floating rate equal to, at the
Company’s option, 1) the applicable LIBOR rate plus a
varying margin between 0.60% and 1.50% or 2) prime rate. At
December 31, 2003, the interest rates, with respect to the
Amended Credit Agreement and Term Loan, ranged from 1.78% to
1.95%. At December 31, 2002, there were no borrowings under
this facility. There have been no material changes to the
remaining terms and conditions.

The credit facility in place through February
2002 provided a $450.0 million line of credit. Loans under
the facility bore interest for each calendar quarter at an
annual rate equal to, at the Company’s option, 1) the
applicable LIBOR rate plus a varying margin between 0.30% and
1.00% or 2) prime rate. Margins on LIBOR borrowings varied
with the Company’s financial performance. Borrowings were
collateralized by substantially

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

all of the Company’s assets. The Company was
also required to meet certain covenants, none of which was
considered restrictive to operations.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had
borrowings under the $250.0 million Amended Credit
Agreement of $100.0 million and an amount available to
borrow of $147.7 million, after outstanding letters of
credit. At December 31, 2003, the $125.0 million Term
Loan was fully drawn. At December 31, 2002, the Company had
no aggregate borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement
and had amounts available to borrow of $248.0 million,
after outstanding letters of credit.

The Company, and its foreign subsidiaries, also
had available short-term lines of credit, totaling
$96.0 million at December 31, 2003 and
$84.1 million at December 31, 2002. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, related short-term borrowings
were $21.3 million at a weighted average interest rate of
2.11% and $7.5 million at a weighted average interest rate
of 2.78%, respectively.

The income tax benefits associated with
nonqualified stock option compensation expense recognized for
tax purposes and credited to additional paid-in capital were
$17.6 million, $7.0 million and $12.7 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The deferred tax benefit of net operating losses
and credits is broken out as follows: $51.9 million
($148.3 million pre-tax) in U.S. operating loss
carryforwards that begin to expire in 2020; $52.0 million
in foreign tax credits, of which $33.1 million expire in
2004; $3.6 million in research and development credits that
begin to expire in 2009; $0.9 million in alternative
minimum income tax credits with no expiration date; and
$2.6 million ($8.8 million pre-tax) in foreign net
operating losses with no expiration date. Because of the
outstanding stock options, which the Company anticipates will
result in net operating loses well into the future, the Company
believes that it is more likely than not that the
U.S. deferred tax benefit of $128.3 million will not
be realized, therefore, a valuation allowance has reduced to
zero all the deferred tax benefit relating to U.S. income.
The deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to the
U.S. To the extent that the deferred tax assets relate to
stock option deductions, the resultant benefits, if and when
realized, will be credited to stockholders’ equity. During
the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company received an
alternative minimum income tax refund of $0.2 million,
resulting from a net operating loss carryback.

Net deferred tax assets included in other current
assets totaled $4.5 million and $2.6 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net deferred tax
liabilities included in other liabilities totaled
$9.3 million at December 31, 2003 and there were no
such liabilities at December 31, 2002.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were 23.6%,
22.1% and 22.3%, respectively. The Company’s effective tax
rate benefited primarily from the preferential tax rate of 10%
afforded by its Irish operations. The Irish rate will increase
to 12.5% in 2011. The effect of the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Irish operation is a benefit of approximately
$23.0 million or $0.19 per share for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The results of the balance of foreign
operations had an insignificant impact on the Company’s
effective tax rate.

At December 31, 2003, there were unremitted
earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately
$644.3 million. The Company has not provided
U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on these
earnings as it is the Company’s intention to permanently
reinvest the earnings outside the U.S. It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might
be payable if such earnings were remitted to the U.S.

12     Patent
Litigation

Applera Corporation:

PE Corporation (since renamed Applera
Corporation), MDS, Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex
(“the Plaintiffs”) filed a civil action against
Micromass UK Limited and Micromass, Inc., wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Company, in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Delaware (“the Court”) on
February 18, 2000. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Quattro
Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer infringes
U.S. Patent No. 4,963,736 (“the patent”).
The patent is owned by MDS, Inc. and licensed to a joint venture
with Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments.

In March 2002, the Company was informed of a
jury’s finding that the Quattro Ultima with Mass Transit
ion tunnel technology infringes the patent. The same jury found
that the infringement was not willful and determined damages in
the amount of $47.5 million. The Court entered an
injunction in which the Company is enjoined from making, using
and selling in the U.S. the Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer incorporating features of the patent.

In March 2003, the Court’s decision was
affirmed on appeal. In April 2003, the Company paid total
damages and interest of approximately $53.7 million to the
Plaintiffs. These instruments are manufactured in the United
Kingdom and shipments to the rest of the world outside the
United States are not subject to this litigation. Similar claims
were asserted against the Company by the Plaintiffs in Japan and
Canada.

The accrued patent litigation expenses of
$19.9 million and $74.9 million recorded as of
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively,
in the consolidated balance sheets, is the Company’s best
estimate of its exposure for this liability. During the year
ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a
$0.5 million pre-tax charge for additional liabilities
associated with interest costs. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Company paid damages and interest of
$53.7 million, made legal expense payments of
$0.4 million, and reversed approximately $0.9 million
of interest as a credit to interest expense in the fourth
quarter.

MDS, Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex
Instruments filed a civil action against Micromass UK Limited,
Waters Limited, wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, and
the Company, in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division,
Patents Courts, UK on October 31, 2003. The case alleged
that certain of the Company’s MS products infringe European
Patent (UK) No. 0 373 835 (the “European
Patent”). To the Company’s knowledge, the European
patent is owned by MDS, Inc. and licensed to a joint venture
with Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments. The Plaintiffs in
this action were seeking an injunction against the Company to
restrain it from infringing the European Patent and an
unspecified award of damages.

Previously, in July 2002, the Company filed a
civil action against Applera Corporation alleging patent
infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,304,798 owned by the
Company. In November 2002, the University of Manitoba (the
’‘University”) and Applera Corporation, its
licensee, filed a civil action against the Company alleging
patent infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,331,702 owned by
the University. (See March 2004 update in Note 22.)

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Hewlett-Packard Company:

The Company filed suit in the United States
against Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH
(collectively, “HP”), seeking a declaration that
certain products sold under the mark “Alliance” do not
constitute an infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or
its foreign subsidiaries (the “HP patents”). The
action in the United States was dismissed for lack of
controversy. Actions seeking revocation or nullification of
foreign HP patents were filed by the Company in Germany, France
and England. A German patent tribunal found the HP German patent
to be valid. In Germany, France and England, HP and its
successor, Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH, have brought
an action alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump
may infringe the HP patents. In England, the Court of Appeal has
found the HP patent valid and infringed. The Company’s
petitions for leave to appeal to the House of Lords have been
denied. In France, the Paris District Court has found the HP
patent valid and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company has
appealed the French decision. A German court has found the
patent infringed. The Company has appealed the German decision.
The Company recorded a provision in the quarter ended
June 30, 2002 for estimated damages incurred with respect
to this ongoing litigation. This provision represents
management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably
estimable loss related to this litigation.

PerkinElmer Corporation:

The Company, through its subsidiary TAI, asserted
a claim against The PerkinElmer Corporation (“PE”)
alleging patent infringement of three patents owned by TAI (the
“TAI patents”). PE counterclaimed for infringement of
a patent owned by PE (the “PE patent”). The
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware granted
judgment as a matter of law in favor of TAI and enjoined PE from
infringing the TAI patents. PE appealed the District Court
judgment in favor of TAI to the federal appellate court. The
District Court’s judgment, with respect to PE’s
infringement of the TAI patents, was affirmed. The District
Court’s judgment with respect to TAI’s
non-infringement of the PE patent was reversed and remanded to
the District Court for further proceedings.

On remand to the District Court in
October 2002, a jury found PE liable to TAI for damages of
$13.3 million and found TAI did not infringe the PE patent.
In May 2003, the District Court entered judgment on the
jury’s verdict in favor of the Company. PE has appealed the
judgment with respect to TAI’s non-infringement of the PE
patent. As of December 31, 2003, no gain has been recorded
and all litigation costs have been expensed as incurred.

Other:

Cohesive Technologies, Inc.
(“Cohesive”) has brought three suits against the
Company in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. Cohesive
alleges that several products of the Company, which are part of
a much larger product line, are an infringement of two Cohesive
U.S. Patents. The Company has denied infringement of such
patents and has asserted several defenses. Two of the products
alleged to be an infringement are now obsolete and are no longer
sold in the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2001, a
jury returned a verdict in one of the suits finding the Company
liable for infringement of one of the two patents. The Company
intends to continue to vigorously defend its position. Judgment
has not been entered on the jury’s verdict and further
proceedings may preclude such entry. The Company believes it has
meritorious positions and should prevail either through judgment
or on appeal, although the outcome is not certain. The Company
believes that any outcome of the proceedings will not be
material to the Company.

Viscotek Corporation (“Viscotek”) filed
a civil action against the Company in the Federal District Court
for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, alleging
that one option offered by the Company with a high temperature
gel permeation chromatography instrument is an infringement of
two of its patents. These patents are owned by E.I. DuPont
de Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) and claimed to
be exclusively licensed to Viscotek. DuPont is not a party to
the suit. On January 16, 2004, a jury returned a verdict
finding that the Company had not infringed Viscotek’s
patents. Judgment has not been entered on the jury’s verdict

and further post trial motions and appeals by
Viscotek may preclude such entry. The Company believes it should
prevail either through judgment or appeal and that any outcome
of the proceedings will not be material to the Company.

13     Environmental
Contingency

In July 2003, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement (the “Environmental Settlement
Agreement”) with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, acting
by and through the Attorney General and the Department of
Environmental Protection, with respect to alleged non-compliance
with state environmental laws at its Taunton, Massachusetts
facility. Pursuant to the terms of a final judgment entered in
the Superior Court of the Commonwealth on July 10, 2003,
the Company paid a civil penalty of $5.9 million. In
addition, the Company has agreed to conduct a Supplemental
Environmental Project in the amount of $0.6 million,
comprised of investments in capital infrastructure, to study the
effects of bio-filtration on certain air emissions from the
Taunton facility and for the purchase of equipment in connection
therewith. Pursuant to the terms of the Environmental Settlement
Agreement, the Company has also agreed to undertake a variety of
actions to ensure that air emissions from the facility do not
exceed certain limits and that the facility is brought into full
compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.

14     Restructuring
and Other Unusual Charges

In July 2002, the Company took action to
restructure and combine its field sales, service and
distribution of its Micromass and HPLC operations. The objective
of this integration is to leverage the strengths of both
divisions and align and reduce operating expenses. The
integration efforts impacted the U.S., Canada, continental
Europe and the United Kingdom. Approximately 55 employees were
to be terminated, of which all had left the Company as of
December 31, 2003. In addition, the Company committed to
closing four sales and distribution facilities, of which one was
closed by December 31, 2003. The Company is in various
stages of terminating distributor contracts, of which two were
closed by December 31, 2003.

The Company recorded $2.6 million of charges
for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $7.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002, for restructuring and
other directly related incremental charges relating to its
integration of the worldwide HPLC and MS sales, service and
support organizations. The charge for the year ended
December 31, 2003 includes severance costs for 13 people,
distributor termination costs and other directly related
incremental costs of this integration effort. The charge for the
year ended December 31, 2002 includes severance costs for
42 people, contract cancellation fees, non-cancelable lease
obligations and other directly related incremental costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company reversed approximately $1.9 million in
restructuring reserves, primarily attributable to facility
closure and distributor termination costs being less than
previously estimated and the retention of certain employees
previously selected for termination. There were no such
reversals in 2002.

The Company has included in the consolidated
balance sheet in other long-term liabilities approximately
$1.5 million and $1.8 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, for non-cancelable lease
obligations with a portion to be paid extending out to 2012. The
remaining $1.1 million and $3.7 of the liability is
included in other current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

year ended December 31, 2002.

15     Other
Commitments and Contingencies

Lease agreements, expiring at various dates
through 2019, cover buildings, office equipment and automobiles.
Rental expense was approximately $19.6 million in 2003,

existing license agreements as of December 31, 2003 are
$0.8 million, $0.4 million, for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, and are
immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2006 and
thereafter.

From time to time, the Company and its
subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising
in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has
meritorious arguments and any outcome, either individually or in
the aggregate, with the exception of the current litigation
described in Note 12, Patent Litigation and Note 13,
Environmental Contingency, will not be material to the financial
position or results of operations.

The Company enters into standard indemnification
agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these
agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees
to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or
incurred by the indemnified party, generally our business
partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or
other intellectual property infringement claims by any third
party with respect to our current products, as well as claims
relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from
the performance of services by us or our subcontractors. The
maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required
to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited.
Historically, our costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and we
accordingly believe the estimated fair value of these agreements
is immaterial.

16     Stock Option
and Purchase Plans

Stock Option Plans

On May 7, 1996, the Company’s
shareholders approved the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(“1996 Plan”), which provides for the granting of
4,000 shares of Common Stock, in the form of incentive or
non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights
(“SARs”), restricted stock or other types of awards.
Under the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may
not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock
at the date of grant. On May 7, 2002 and May 12, 1998,
the Company’s shareholders approved an additional 5,750 and
8,000 shares, respectively, of Common Stock for issue under
the 1996 Plan. The 1996 Plan is scheduled to terminate on
May 7, 2006, unless extended for a period of up to five
years by action of the Board of Directors. Options generally
will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they
are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. A SAR may be
granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award.
Except for stock options, no SARs, restricted stock or other
types of awards were outstanding as of December 31, 2003.

The Company’s 1994 Stock Option Plan
(”1994 Plan”) provided for the granting of 20,141
options to purchase shares of Common Stock to certain key
employees of the Company. The exercise price of the options was
determined by a committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company. Options granted have a term of ten years and vest in
five equal installments on the first five anniversaries after
the grant.

On May 7, 1996, the Company’s
shareholders approved the 1996 Non-Employee Director Deferred
Compensation Plan (“Deferred Compensation Plan”) and
the 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (“Director
Stock Option Plan”). Under the Deferred Compensation Plan,
outside directors may elect to defer their fees and credit such
fees to either a cash account which earns interest at a
market-based rate or to a common stock unit account, for which
four hundred thousand shares of Common Stock have been reserved.
Under the Director Stock Option Plan, each outside director will
receive an annual option to purchase four thousand shares of
Common Stock. Two hundred thousand shares of Common Stock may be
issued under the plan. Options have a term of ten years and,
with the exception of options granted in 1996, which vest in one

no less than fair market value at the date of grant.

On November 20, 2003, the Company’s
shareholders approved the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (“2003
Plan”). The 2003 Plan replaced the 1996 Plan, the Director
Stock Option Plan and the 1994 Plan, under all of which
5,697 shares remained available for granting in the form of
incentive or non-qualified stock options, SARs, restricted stock
or other types of awards. Under the 2003 Plan the exercise price
for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of
the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2003 Plan is

service. Employees may contribute from 1% to 30% of eligible pay
on a pre-tax basis. After one year of service, the Company makes
a matching contribution of 50% for contributions up to 6% of
eligible pay. Employees are 100% vested in employee and company
matching contributions. For the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company’s matching contributions
amounted to $2.9 million, $2.7 million and
$2.4 million, respectively.

U.S. employees are eligible to participate
in the Waters Retirement Plan after one year of service.
Annually, the Company credits each employee’s account as a
percentage of eligible pay based on years of service. In
addition, each employee’s account is credited for
investment returns at the beginning of each year for the prior
year at the average 12 month Treasury Bill rate plus
0.5%, limited to a minimum rate of 5% and a maximum rate of 10%.
An employee does not vest until the completion of five years of
service at which time the employee becomes 100% vested.

The net periodic pension cost under SFAS 87,
Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, is made up of several
components that reflect different aspects of the Company’s
financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits earned by
employees. These components are determined using the projected
unit credit actuarial cost method and are based on certain
actuarial assumptions. The Company’s accounting policy is
to reflect in the projected benefit obligation all benefit
changes to which the Company is committed as of the current
valuation date; use a market-related value of assets to
determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior service
costs on a straight-line basis over the expected future service
of active participants as of the date such costs are first
recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and losses
in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related value of
plan assets and the projected benefit obligation over the
expected future service of active participants.

Summary data for the Waters Retirement Plan are
presented in the following tables, using the measurement date of
December 31, 2003 (in thousands):

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated
benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the Waters
Retirement Plan were approximately $56.0 million,
$50.2 million and $37.3 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2003 and $43.8 million,
$39.5 million and $24.4 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2002.

The Company sponsors various
non-U.S. retirement plans. Accrued pension costs for these
plans included in current accrued retirement plan contributions
at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were approximately
$1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Accrued
pension costs for these plans included in long-term portion of
post retirement benefits at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were
approximately $11.3 million and $9.4 million,
respectively. Prepaid pension costs for these plans included in
other assets totaled $1.8 million and $1.5 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The projected
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the
significant plans were approximately $17.1 million and
$7.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and
$13.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2002.

The Company also sponsors other unfunded employee
benefit plans in the U.S., including a post-retirement health
care plan, which provides reimbursement for medical expenses and
is contributory. The Company’s accrued post-retirement
benefit obligation for this plan was $3.1 million and
$3.0 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, and is included in long-term portion of post
retirement benefits in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company also maintains an unfunded
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which
is nonqualified and restores the benefits under the Waters
Retirement Plan that are limited by IRS benefit and compensation
maximums. The Company’s accrued post-retirement benefit
obligation for this plan was $2.3 million and
$2.0 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, and is included in long-term portion of post
retirement benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. Also
included in the long-term portion of post retirement benefits is
$12.2 million and $9.1 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, relating to the liability
associated with the SERP plan assets.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The retirement plan’s investment policy was
last amended in September 2002 to include the following asset
allocation guidelines:

Prior to September 2002, the asset allocation
targets were 72% equity and 28% fixed income. The rebalancing
towards the new targets is accomplished through the investment
of future contributions.

The asset allocation policy was developed in
consideration of the following long-term investment objectives:
achieving a return on assets consistent with the investment
policy, maximizing portfolio returns with at least a return of
2.5% above the one-year Treasury Bill rate, and achieving
portfolio returns which exceeds the average return for similarly
invested funds.

The Company increased its allocation to debt
securities during 2003 from 26% to 32% based on the new target
allocation. The increase in fixed income securities will help
better match the interest rate sensitivity of the pension
liabilities and limit the risk associated with equity funds.
Within the equity portfolio, investments are diversified among
capitalization and style. Up to 20% of the equity portfolio may
be invested in financial markets outside of the United States.
The Company does not invest in its own stock within the pension
assets.

The Company prohibits the following types of
assets or transactions: short selling, margin transactions,
commodities and future contracts, private placements, options
and letter stock.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return
on assets assumption, the Company considered the historical
returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset
class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension
portfolio and historical expenses paid by the plan. This
resulted in the selection of the 8.00% long-term rate of return
on assets assumption, net of expenses paid by the plan.

During fiscal year 2004, the Company expects to
contribute $10.0 million to the plan.

Waters is in the business of manufacturing and
distributing HPLC instruments, columns, other consumables and
mass spectrometry instruments that can be integrated and used
along with other analytical instruments. TAI is in the business
of manufacturing and distributing thermal analysis and rheology
instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have
similar economic characteristics, product processes, products
and services, types and classes of customers, methods of
distribution, and regulatory environments. Because of these
similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one
reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer

information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company.

Quarterly Results

The Company’s unaudited quarterly results
are summarized below (in thousands, except per share data):



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company experiences a seasonal increase in
sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits on
capital goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending
budgets by calendar year-end. Selling, general and expenses were
lower in the first quarters of 2003 and 2002 compared to other
quarters in respective calendar years due to foreign currency
translation, lower spending in marketing programs and lower
costs such as sales commissions and incentive plans directly
related to sales volume. In addition, expenses are traditionally
higher in the second quarter of each year as this is the
Company’s annual payroll merit increase period.

22     Subsequent
Events

In January 2004, the Company initiated a
restructuring effort to realign its personnel between various
support functions and various field, sales and service
organizations. As a result, approximately 80 employees are
to be terminated, primarily in the U.S., in the first quarter of
2004. A similar number of new employees are to be hired in
various geographies around the world, primarily in sales and
service functions with the goal of increasing sales. The Company
expects to record a restructuring charge of approximately
$2.0 million in the first quarter of 2004.

In the first quarter of 2004, the Company
acquired 100% of the Common Stock of NuGenesis Technologies
Corporation for approximately $43.2 million in cash. This
transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company will
record each acquired asset and liability assumed at its fair
value, which is subject to future adjustment when appraisals or
other valuation data have been obtained.

On March 2, 2004, the Company and MDS, Inc.
through its Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments partnership
and Applied Biosystems entered into a settlement agreement (the
“Applera Settlement Agreement”) with respect to the
various civil actions pending against each of them, both in the
United States and internationally. Stipulations of Dismissal or
their foreign equivalents (the “Stipulations”) with
respect to the disposal of all such actions have been submitted
to the applicable courts and tribunals in each of the United
States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.

The Applera Settlement Agreement provides for the
resolution of all patent infringement claims in the United
States made by certain of the parties against the other and of
international cases brought by MDS, Inc. and Applied
Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments against the Company with
respect to alleged infringements of those parties’ patents
at issue in the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.

In consideration of entering into the Applera
Settlement Agreement and the Stipulations, the Company and MDS,
Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments have entered
into royalty paying license agreements cross licensing the use
of the technology described in the parties’ respective
patents at issue. In addition, the Company made a one-time
payment to Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments of
$18.1 million on March 11, 2004, which is fully
accrued at December 31, 2003.
