Part I

Items 1. & 2. Business and Properties

General

In 1995, DTE Energy incorporated in the State of Michigan. Our utility operations consist
primarily of Detroit Edison and MichCon. We also have numerous non-utility subsidiaries engaged in
energy marketing and trading, energy services, and various other electricity, coal and gas related
businesses. DTE Energy is an exempt holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
(PUHCA) of 1935, except Section 9(a)(2) that relates to the acquisition of securities of public
utility companies and Section 33 that relates to the acquisition of foreign (non-U.S.) utility
companies.

Detroit Edison is a Michigan corporation organized in 1903 and is a public utility subject to
regulation by the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). Detroit Edison is engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution and sale of
electricity to 2.1 million customers in southeastern Michigan.

MichCon is a Michigan corporation organized in 1898 and is a public utility subject to regulation
by the MPSC. MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage, transmission, distribution and sale of
natural gas to 1.2 million customers throughout Michigan.

In February 2003, we sold the International Transmission Company (ITC), a FERC regulated
transmission company. See Note 3 for a further discussion of the ITC sale and its presentation as a
discontinued operation.

Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and
all amendments to such reports are available free of charge through the investor relations page of
our website:

www.dteenergy.com

, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or

or provide waivers from, the provisions of the code of ethics that the SEC requires us to disclose,
we intend to disclose these events in the governance section of our investor relations website.

References in this report to “we,” “us,” “our” or “Company” are to DTE Energy and its subsidiaries,
collectively.

Corporate Structure

Through 2004, we operated our businesses through three strategic business units (Energy
Resources, Energy Distribution and Energy Gas). Each business unit had utility and non-utility
operations. The balance of our business consisted of Corporate & Other. See Note 16 — Segment and
Related Information, for financial information by segment for the last three years. In 2005, we
expect to realign our business



units to strengthen the Company’s focus on customer relationships and growth within our non-utility
businesses. Based on this structure, we will set strategic goals, allocate resources and evaluate
performance. Beginning with the first quarter of 2005, we expect to report our segment information
based on a new structure as described in Note 1. A discussion of each business unit based on the
structure in effect over the past three years follows.

ENERGY RESOURCES

Utility – Power Generation

Description

Power Generation comprises our utility power generation business and plants within Detroit Edison.
These plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies, including the MPSC,
the FERC, the NRC, the EPA and the MDEQ. Electricity is generated from Detroit Edison’s numerous
fossil plants, its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant, and is purchased from
electricity generators, suppliers and wholesalers. The electricity we produce and purchase is sold
to four major classes of customers: residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale, principally
throughout Michigan, the Midwest and Ontario, Canada.

Weather, economic factors and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers. Our peak load
and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year, driven by air
conditioning and other cooling-related demands. Power generation sales are made to a diverse base
of customers in both type and number; sales levels are not dependent on any small market segment.
Customers who elect to purchase their electricity from alternative energy suppliers by
participating in the electric Customer Choice program have an unfavorable effect on our financial
performance.



Our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with market purchases. The
following table details our energy supply mix and average cost per unit:

We expect an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve
customers. The effect of lost sales due to the electric Customer Choice program has reduced our
need for purchased power and increased our ability to sell power in the wholesale market. We have
short and long-term supply contracts for expected fuel and purchased power requirements as detailed
in the following table:

Power Generation’s generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal.
Coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in
both pricing and terms. Detroit Edison expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements
through long-term contracts with the balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot
purchases. Detroit Edison has contracts with five coal suppliers and several over-the-counter
brokers for a total purchase of up to 35 million tons of low-sulfur western coal to be delivered

through 2008. Detroit Edison also has contracts with four suppliers for the purchase of
approximately 6 million tons of Appalachian coal to be delivered through 2006. These existing
long-term coal contracts either have fixed prices or include provisions for price escalation as
well as de-escalation. Given the geographic diversity of supply, Detroit Edison believes it can
meet the expected generation requirements. We own and lease a fleet of rail cars and have long-term
transportation contracts with companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of
purchased coal to our generating facilities.

We purchase power from other electricity generators, suppliers and wholesalers. These purchases
supplement our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles. For example, when
high temperatures occur during the summer, we require additional electricity to meet demand. This
access to additional power is an efficient and economical way to meet our obligation to customers
without increasing capital expenditures to build additional power facilities.



Regulation

Detroit Edison’s Power Generation business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various
agencies, including the MPSC, the FERC and the NRC. The MPSC issues orders pertaining to rates,
recovery of certain costs, including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets,
conditions of service, accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit Edison’s MPSC-approved
rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus
an authorized rate of return on our investments. The FERC regulates Detroit Edison with respect to
financing authorization and wholesale electric activities. The NRC has regulatory jurisdiction
over all phases of the operation, construction, licensing and decommissioning of Detroit Edison’s
Fermi 2 nuclear plant.

Since 1996 there have been several important acts, orders, court rulings and legislative actions in
the State of Michigan that affect our Power Generation operations. In 1996, the MPSC began an
initiative designed to give all of Michigan’s electric customers access to electricity supplied by
other generators and marketers. In 1998, the MPSC authorized the electric Customer Choice program
that allowed for a limited number of customers to purchase electricity from suppliers other than
their local utility. The local utility would continue to transport the electric supply to the
customers’ facilities, thereby retaining distribution margins. The electric Customer Choice
program was phased in over a three-year period, with all customers having the option to choose
their electric supplier by January 2002.

In 2000, the Michigan Legislature enacted legislation that reduced electric rates by 5% and
reaffirmed January 2002 as the date for full implementation of the electric Customer Choice
program. This legislation also contained provisions freezing rates through 2003 and preventing
rate increases for small business customers through 2004 and for residential customers through
2005. The legislation and an MPSC order issued in 2001 established a methodology to enable Detroit
Edison to recover stranded costs related to its generation operations that may not otherwise be
recoverable due to electric Customer Choice related lost sales and margins. The legislation also
provides for the recovery of the costs associated with the implementation of the electric Customer
Choice program. The MPSC has determined that these costs will be treated as regulatory assets.
Additionally, the legislation provides for recovery of costs incurred as a result of changes in
taxes, laws and other governmental actions including the Clean Air Act.

In 2004, the MPSC issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases
totaling $374 million, and eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for
electric Customer Choice customers. The increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a
rate cap. The interim order affirmed the resumption of the Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR)
mechanism for both capped and uncapped customers, which reduced PSCR revenues. The MPSC also
authorized the recovery of approximately $385 million in regulatory assets, including stranded
costs. The final order addressed numerous issues relating to regulatory assets, including the
actual amounts recoverable and the recovery mechanism.

See Note 4 – Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the 2004 rate orders and our
regulatory environment.

Strategy and Competition

We strive to be the preferred electricity supplier in southeast Michigan. We believe that we can
accomplish our goal by working with our customers, communities and regulatory agencies to be a
reliable low cost supplier of electricity. To control expenses, we optimize our fuel blends
thereby taking maximum advantage of low cost, environmentally friendly low-sulfur western coals.
To ensure generation reliability, we will continue to make investments in our generating plants
that will improve both plant availability and operating efficiencies. Revenues from year to year
will vary due to weather conditions, economic factors, regulatory events and other risk factors as
discussed in the “RISK FACTORS” section that follows.

Effective January 2002, the electric Customer Choice program expanded in Michigan whereby all of
the Company’s electric customers can choose to purchase their electricity from alternative
suppliers of generation services. Detroit Edison lost 18% of retail sales in 2004, 12% in 2003 and
5% of such sales in 2002 as a result of customers choosing to purchase power from alternative
suppliers. Customers participating in the electric Customer Choice program consist primarily of
industrial and commercial customers whose MPSC-authorized full service rates exceed the cost of
service. We will continue to utilize the wholesale market to sell the generation made available by
the electric Customer Choice program, in order to lower costs for full service customers.



Energy Services

Description

Energy Services has three business lines: Coal-Based Fuels, On-Site Energy Projects and Power
Generation.

Coal-Based Fuels

Energy Services’ Coal-Based Fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel
plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants. The production of synfuel from all of the
synfuel plants and the production of coke from one of the coke battery plants generate tax credits
under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 29 is designed to stimulate investment in
and development of alternate fuel sources. We have private letter rulings from the IRS for all of
our synfuel plants. Synfuel-related Section 29 tax credits expire in 2007. Section 29 tax credits
for two of our three coke batteries expired at the end of 2002 with the third expiring in 2007.

The synthetic fuel process involves chemically modifying and binding particles of coal to produce a
fuel that is used for power generation and coke production. The modification involves a three-step
process that produces a solid synthetic fuel product. Since 2002, we have sold majority interests
in eight of our nine synfuel plants, representing approximately 92 percent of our total production
capacity. We anticipate selling a majority interest in our remaining 100% owned synfuel plant in
2005. We continue to consolidate these projects due to our controlling influence.

The coke battery facilities produce coke that is used in blast furnaces within the steel industry.
DTE Energy is one of the largest independent producers in the U.S. of coke for the steel industry.

On-Site Energy Projects

Energy Services owns and/or operates on-site facilities, including pulverized coal injection, power
generation, steam production, chilled water, wastewater treatment and compressed air. Many of
these facilities deliver utility-type services to industrial, commercial and institutional
customers. In 2004, we formed a utility services company that acquired utility-related assets from
a large automotive company and entered into long-term agreements to provide utility and energy
conservation services to the company. We then sold a 50% interest in the project to an unaffiliated
partner. Also in 2004, we



purchased a 50% interest in a company that owns and operates a cogeneration facility serving a
tissue mill located in Mobile, Alabama.

Power Generation – Non-Utility

Energy Services operates peaking and gas-fired electric generating plants. We have four electric
generating plants in operation, all located in the Great Lakes region. In 2004, we sold two of the
three units at our Georgetown plant. We have contracts for the sale of approximately 42% of the
2005 and 2006 output of the remaining units.

Properties

As of December 31, 2004, Coal-Based Fuels owns interests in and operates nine synfuel plants at
eight production sites. Additionally, we have interests in three coke battery facilities in the
United States, two of which we operate.

facilities serving coal transporters, as well as other industries and rail car types. We
participate in the trading of coal and emissions credits as well as coal-to-power tolling
transactions. In 2003, we entered into the waste coal recovery business by purchasing a patented
technology and constructing our first commercial facility.

the site of a former operating coal mine in Ohio.

Strategy and Competition

We continue to leverage our position as one of the top North American coal marketers and our
reputation as an efficient manager of transportation assets. Trends such as railroad and mining
consolidation and the financial uncertainty of many mining firms could have an impact on how we
compete in the future. We will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure
and competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers.

We acquired the rights to a proprietary technology that produces high quality coal products from
fine coal slurries that are typically discarded from coal mining operations (waste coal recovery).
The technology has the additional benefit of improving the environment by allowing us to restore
the land in accordance with reclamation requirements of each state. The technology produces a
fine-coal fuel by removing mineral matter, clay-like impurities and oxides from waste material. The
fine-coal fuel can be used in power plants, as a feedstock for synthetic fuel production and for
other industrial applications. Our first facility in Ohio became operational in late-2003. We have
experienced certain complications with our feedstock excavating process. We are working to resolve
these complications and increase our production capacity to more than 500,000 tons of fine coal per
year. We believe that the waste coal recovery business has the potential to contribute
significantly to future earnings and provide significant environmental benefits.

Biomass

Description

Biomass develops, owns and operates landfill gas recovery systems in the U.S. Landfill gas, a
byproduct of solid waste decomposition, is composed of approximately equal portions of methane and
carbon dioxide. Converting the methane into a renewable energy resource conserves fossil fuels. Some
Biomass operations generate Section 29 tax credits that will expire in 2007.



Biomass helps limit potential greenhouse gas emissions by developing and implementing landfill gas
recovery systems that capture the gas and use it productively. Such a recovery system eliminates
detrimental air emissions by preventing methane from escaping into the atmosphere or migrating
off-site and becoming a safety hazard. Landfill gas recovery systems also provide local utilities,
industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive, renewable source of energy.
Applications for this form of energy include steam and electricity generation, fueling of asphalt
plants and brick kilns and for processing into pipeline quality gas. In 2004, Biomass entered into
a joint venture with Coal Services to acquire facilities that produce coal mine methane gas.

Biomass’ strategy capitalizes upon our industry experience of over 20 years. We are evaluating
business growth through both development and acquisitions. We compete primarily with fossil fuels
such as natural gas and coal. However, we believe the environmental benefits of biomass along with
reasonable and economic access to landfill sites provide a platform for future growth.

ENERGY DISTRIBUTION

Utility – Power Distribution

Description

The electric distribution services of Detroit Edison comprise our utility Power Distribution
business. This business distributes electricity generated by Energy Resources’ Power Generation
business and alternative energy suppliers to Detroit Edison’s 2.1 million customers in southeastern
Michigan. This business also shares, with the Gas Distribution segment, the customer service and
regulated marketing functions for our utilities. Accordingly, costs associated with these
functions, including collections and customer service activities, are shared between Power
Distribution and Gas Distribution.

In January 2003, we sold the steam heating business of Detroit Edison to Thermal Ventures II, LP.
In February 2003, we sold ITC to an affiliate of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. and Trimaran
Capital Partners, LLC. ITC will continue to provide transmission services to the Energy
Distribution business at rates that will be recovered from Detroit Edison’s utility customers.

Weather and economic factors affect our sales and revenues. Similar to the Power Generation
business, our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of
the year driven by air conditioning and other cooling-related demands. Power Distribution’s sales
are not dependent upon a limited number of customers. Although customers participating in the
electric Customer Choice program do not impact the total number of Power Distribution customers, they do impact operating revenues.
Electric Choice customers currently pay a lower distribution rate than full service customers.
Accordingly, customers participating in the electric Customer Choice program unfavorably affect
revenues. Detroit Edison filed a



rate restructuring proposal in February 2005 to eliminate this
intra class rate subsidy (Note 4). The loss of any one or a few customers is not reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect on Power Distribution.

Regulation

Detroit Edison’s Power Distribution is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which has
regulatory authority over rates, conditions of service and other operating-related matters. As
previously discussed, Michigan legislation prevents Detroit Edison from increasing rates to
residential customers through 2005 and prevented rate increases for small business customers
through 2004.

In January 2004, the MPSC issued an order adopting rules governing service quality and
reliability standards for electric distribution systems. The reliability standards establish
performance levels for service restoration, wire-down relief requests, customer call answer time,
customer complaint response, meter reading and new service installations. The order also
establishes penalties for delays in service restoration during normal conditions, catastrophic
storms and repetitive outages. Detroit Edison is required to file an annual report providing
information regarding performance against the measures provided and any penalties incurred.

In 2004, the MPSC issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases
totaling $374 million, and eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for
electric Customer Choice customers. The increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a
rate cap. The MPSC also authorized the recovery of approximately $385 million in regulatory assets,
including stranded costs. The final order addressed numerous issues relating to regulatory assets,
including the actual amounts recoverable and the recovery mechanism.

See Note 4 – Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the 2004 rate orders and our
regulatory environment.

Energy Assistance Programs

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain
critical to Detroit Edison’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and
collections expenses.

Detroit Edison’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of
government funded assistance its qualifying customers receive. We are working with the State of
Michigan and others to increase the share of funding allocated to our customers to be
representative of the number of low-income individuals in our service territory.



Properties

Detroit Edison owns and operates 667 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately
31,381,500 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and approximately 415,000 line transformers with a capacity of
approximately 24,792,000 kVA. Substantially all of the net utility properties of Detroit Edison
are subject to the lien of its mortgage. Circuit miles of distribution lines owned and in service
as of December 31, 2004 are as follows:

There are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between Detroit
Edison and electricity providers external to our service area. These interconnections are
generally owned and operated by ITC and connect to neighboring energy companies.

Strategy and Competition

Our strategy focuses on improving reliability, restoration time and the quality of customer service
and lowering operating costs by improving operating efficiencies. We also are targeting capital
investments in areas that have the greatest impact on reliability improvements with the goal of
managing distribution rates charged to utility customers.

The decision to sell ITC was consistent with our strategic view that maximization of shareholder
value and high levels of customer service are best achieved with assets that we own, operate and
over which we exercise significant control. By FERC order, rates charged by ITC to Detroit Edison
were frozen through December 2004. Thereafter, rates became subject to normal FERC regulation.
With the MPSC’s November 2004 final rate order, transmission costs are recoverable through Detroit
Edison’s PSCR mechanism.

Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the on-site
generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and
commercial customers. We do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of
customers in the near term.

Distributed Generation

Description

Distributed Generation, primarily consisting of DTE Energy Technologies (Dtech), invests in
emerging technologies that complement our existing businesses. We currently have businesses that
develop, assemble, market, distribute and service distributed generation products, provide
application engineering, and monitor and manage system operations.

In 2004, Dtech revised its strategy to reduce the losses that occurred in the development phase of
the business over the past four years. As a result, we closed most of our sales offices and created
two regional selling offices, located in Southern California and in Michigan. These offices will
concentrate on higher-margin sales. Additionally, Dtech’s organization was reduced and realigned
to be more efficient.



Also in 2004, Dtech purchased the assets of the developer and assembler of its continuous duty
products ranging from 75kW to 150kW.

The above changes, along with reduction of Dtech’s operating expenses, are expected to improve the
financial performance of this business.

Strategy and Competition

Our goal is to become a profitable participant in the emerging distributed generation market,
providing one-stop shopping that meets customers’ total energy needs. Our strategy is to increase
focus on our proprietary pre-engineered and packaged continuous duty generation products.

Competition in the distributed generation business comes from distributors and manufacturers of
stand-by and continuous duty generators. The success of this business depends on the continued
development of new products, refinement of existing products, the expansion of customer acceptance
of continuous duty distributed generation, and our ability to execute our plans.

ENERGY GAS

Utility – Gas Distribution

Description

Gas Distribution operations primarily consist of MichCon, our gas utility. Gas Distribution
provides gas sales and transportation delivery services to 1.2 million residential, commercial and
industrial customers located throughout Michigan.

Gas Distribution makes gas sales primarily to residential and small-volume commercial and
industrial customers. It provides end user transportation to large-volume commercial and
industrial customers and gas Customer Choice customers who purchase natural gas directly from other
suppliers and utilize MichCon’s pipeline network to transport the gas to the customers’ facilities.
Gas Distribution provides intermediate transportation to producers, brokers and other gas
companies that own the natural gas transported, but are not the ultimate consumers. MichCon’s
revenues and net income are impacted by weather and are concentrated in the first and fourth
quarters of the year due to heating-related demand. MichCon’s operations are not dependent upon a
limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers is not reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on MichCon.

The following table details sales and deliveries to these customers.

We obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas under
agreements that vary in both pricing and terms. Supply under contract represents approximately 58%
of the expected 188 Bcf of supply requirements in 2005. We expect to meet the balance of gas
supply requirements through open market purchases. We expect that 20% of our 2005 purchases will
be under fixed-price contracts, with the remaining 80% acquired at prevailing market prices. As a
result of varying demand primarily due to weather, MichCon may use existing gas in inventory to
meet unanticipated customer obligations. Given the geographic diversity of supply, coupled with
its 124 Bcf of storage capacity, MichCon believes it can meet the supply requirements for
customers. MichCon has long-term firm transportation agreements expiring on various dates through
2011 for delivery of purchased natural gas to our distribution system.

Regulation

MichCon is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to
rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of regulatory assets, conditions of service,
accounting and operating-related matters. MichCon is subject to the requirements of other
regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment and health.

In the late 1990s, the MPSC began an initiative designed to give all of Michigan’s natural gas
customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower gas costs resulting from
competition. In 1999, the MPSC approved a comprehensive experimental three-year gas Customer
Choice program that allowed an increasing number of customers to purchase natural gas from
suppliers other than their local utility. In December 2001, the MPSC issued an order that continued
the gas Customer Choice program on a permanent and expanding basis. The permanent gas Customer
Choice program was phased in over a three-year period, with all customers having the option to
choose their gas supplier by April 2004. Since MichCon continues to transport and deliver the gas
to the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales,
customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on MichCon’s earnings.

Under the December 2001 MPSC order, MichCon returned to a gas cost recovery (GCR) mechanism,
effective January 2002. Under this mechanism, MichCon’s gas sales rates include a gas commodity
component designed to recover its actual gas costs and therefore does not have a commodity price
risk for prudently incurred gas costs.

In September 2003, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for an increase in service and
distribution charges (base rates) for its gas sales and transportation customers. The filing
requests an overall increase in base rates of $194 million per year (approximately 7% increase,
inclusive of gas costs), beginning January 1, 2005. In September 2004, the MPSC issued an order
granting interim rate relief of $35 million annually to MichCon. A final order is expected in the
first quarter of 2005.

See Note 4 - Regulatory Matters, for additional information regarding the September 2004 interim
rate order and our regulatory environment.

Energy Assistance Programs

Energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan remain
critical to MichCon’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable expenses.

As previously discussed, we are working with the State of Michigan and others to increase the share
of funding allocated to our customers to be representative of the number of low-income individuals
in our service territory.



Properties

MichCon owns distribution, transmission and storage properties and facilities that are all located
in the State of Michigan. At December 31, 2004, MichCon’s distribution system included
approximately 18,000 miles of distribution mains, approximately 1,164,000 service lines and
approximately 1,275,000 active meters. MichCon owns approximately 2,600 miles of transmission
lines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect its storage fields
with the sources of supply and the market areas. MichCon owns properties relating to four
underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of
approximately 124 Bcf. Substantially all of the net utility properties of MichCon are subject to
the lien of its mortgage.

Strategy and Competition

The strategy of the Gas Distribution business is to expand our role as the preferred provider of
natural gas in Michigan. As a result of more efficient furnaces and appliances, we expect future
sales volumes to remain at current levels or slightly decline. To offset these factors, we plan to
expand our gas markets and to continue providing energy-related services that capitalize on our
expertise, capabilities and efficient systems.

Competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas providers, alternate fuels and
energy sources. Natural gas continues to be the preferred space and water-heating fuel.
Developers select natural gas in new construction because of the convenience, cleanliness and
relative price advantage compared to propane, fuel oil and other alternative fuels.

Gas Production

Description

The Gas Production business is engaged in natural gas exploration, development and production. Gas
Production owns one of the industry’s largest Antrim gas reserve bases predominantly located in the
northern portion of the lower peninsula of Michigan. Our emphasis is on developing and producing
the 335.4 Bcfe of proven reserves we owned as of December 31, 2004. We drilled 79 wells (67.3 net
of interest of others) in 2004 with a success rate of 99%. Wells drilled in the Antrim shale have
high success rates and low drilling costs, and are therefore considered low risk.

Gas Production is also involved in unconventional drilling opportunities outside of the State of
Michigan that leverage our gas production capabilities and the skills and the experience of our
other non-utility businesses. During 2004, Gas Production acquired 55,792 leasehold acres (48,857
net of interest of others) in the southern region of the Barnett shale in Texas, an area of
increasing production. We currently have 7.9 Bcfe of proven reserves in the Barnett shale as of
December 31, 2004. We began drilling 3 new wells (1.7 net of interest of others) in December 2004
and anticipate drilling additional wells, including test wells, in the first half of 2005. Initial
results from the test wells are expected in mid-2005. If the results are successful, we could
commit from $250 million to $500 million of capital over the next several years to develop these
properties.

The Antrim shale properties had 22.5 Bcfe of production in 2004. Gas Production expects to
maintain its 335.4 Bcfe of proven reserves at December 31, 2004 by developing its acreage, thereby
adding new reserves in low risk areas.

If Barnett shale test wells prove successful, Gas Production expects to substantially increase its
proven reserves by investing a significant level of capital through 2008 to develop these
properties.

Strategy

The Gas Production business is aggressively managing its Michigan gas producing assets to maximize
returns on investment and increase earnings. We have operator responsibilities for our Michigan
properties with the goal of optimizing the cost of producing reserves and adding additional
reserves. During 2005, Gas Production plans to further develop and produce its Antrim shale acreage
and wells.

In order to leverage our gas production capabilities and the skills and experience of other
non-utility businesses, we plan to continue investing in unconventional drilling opportunities
outside of Michigan such as the Barnett shale.

Gas Storage, Pipelines & Processing

Description

The Gas Storage, Pipelines & Processing business has partnership interests in an interstate
transmission pipeline, Vector Pipeline (Vector), seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a
9.7 Bcf natural gas storage field. Additionally, we lease through 2029 a 60.5 Bcf natural gas
storage field located in Michigan.

Strategy and Competition

Gas Storage, Pipelines & Processing focuses on opportunities in the Midwest-to-Northeast region
that supply natural gas to meet growing demand. We expect much of the growth in the demand for
natural gas in the U.S. to occur within the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions. These regions
currently lack the pipeline capacity and gas storage necessary to deliver gas volumes to meet
growing demand. Vector is an interstate pipeline that is filling a large portion of that need, and
is complemented by Energy Gas’ significant storage capacity. Gas Storage, Pipelines & Processing
has interests in seven processing plants that extract carbon dioxide from Antrim gas production
making it suitable for transportation to nearby markets. Additionally, we have contract rights in
natural gas storage fields, capable of storing up to 70.2 Bcf. We plan to continue identifying
asset opportunities related to natural gas storage and transmission and working with other DTE
Energy affiliates to secure the market required to support asset investment. One of those
opportunities is Millennium Pipeline, which we have a 10.5% interest in. Upon securing market
support, the Millennium Pipeline could be in-service in the 2006-2007 timeframe and would be able
to transport up to 500 MMcf per day of gas originating from our Michigan storage facilities to the
higher value markets in New York.

CORPORATE & OTHER

Description

Corporate & Other includes various corporate support functions such as accounting, legal and
information technology. These functions essentially support the entire company and the related
costs are fully allocated to the various segments based on services utilized. Additionally,
Corporate & Other holds certain non-utility debt and investments in emerging energy technologies,
including assets held for sale.

Strategy and Competition

Our energy technology venture fund strategy is to invest in a profitable portfolio of energy
technology companies that facilitate the creation of new businesses, and expand growth
opportunities for existing DTE Energy businesses. We seek to gain early experience in emerging
energy sectors where energy trends and technologies may create potentially profitable
opportunities. The investment portfolio consists of direct investments in energy technology
companies and venture funds.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to extensive environmental regulation. Additional costs may result as the
effects of various chemicals on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are
developed and implemented. We expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations
through



rates charged to our customers. Greater details on environmental issues are provided in
the following Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:

Nuclear Operations


Commitments and Contingencies

Detroit Edison

Detroit Edison is subject to applicable permit requirements, and to potentially increased stringent
federal, state and local standards covering, among other things, particulate and gaseous stack
emission limitations, the discharge of wastewater into lakes and streams and the handling and
disposal of waste material.

Air

- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has ozone transport and acid rain regulations
and, in December 2003, proposed additional emission regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate
and mercury air pollution. The new rules would lead to additional controls on fossil-fueled power
plants to reduce nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. To comply with existing
requirements, Detroit Edison has spent approximately $580 million through December 2004 and
estimates that it will spend up to $100 million in 2005. Detroit Edison will incur from $700
million to $1.3 billion of additional future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years
to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control requirements.

The EPA initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of
new source provisions of the Clean Air Act. Detroit Edison received and responded to information
requests from the EPA on this subject. The EPA has not initiated proceedings against Detroit
Edison. In October 2003, the EPA promulgated revised regulations to clarify new source review
provisions going forward. Several states and environmental organizations have challenged these
regulations and, in December 2003, the Court stayed the implementation of the regulations until the
U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit renders an opinion in the case. We cannot predict the future
impact of this issue upon Detroit Edison.

Water

- Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts
of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. Based on the results of
studies to be conducted over the next several years, Detroit Edison may be required to install
additional control technologies to reduce the environmental impact of the intakes. Detroit Edison
estimates that it will incur up to $50 million over the next five to seven years in additional
capital expenditures to comply with these requirements.

Contaminated Sites

- Detroit Edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites,
including two former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites, the area surrounding an ash landfill and
several underground and aboveground storage tank locations. The findings of these investigations
indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is approximately $8 million, which is
expected to be incurred over the next several years. As a result of the investigation, Detroit
Edison accrued an $8 million liability during 2004.

MichCon and Citizens

Contaminated Sites

- Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for
heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. DTE
Enterprises (MichCon and Citizens, a wholly owned gas utility located in Adrian, Michigan) owns, or
previously owned, 18 such former MGP sites. Investigations have revealed contamination related to
the by-products of gas manufacturing at each site. Enterprises is remediating eight of the former
MGP sites and conducting more extensive investigations at five other former MGP sites. Enterprises
received Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) closure of one site and a determination that it is not a



responsible party for three other sites. Enterprises also received a closure from the EPA in 2002
for one site. While we cannot make any assurances, we believe that a cost deferral and rate
recovery mechanism approved by the MPSC will prevent these costs from having a material adverse
impact on our results of operations.

Other

Our non-utility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing
with the protection of the environment from various pollutants. Our non-utility affiliates are
substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements.

Various state and federal laws regulate our handling, storage and disposal of waste materials. The
EPA and the MDEQ have aggressive programs to manage the clean up of contaminated property. We have
extensive land holdings and, from time to time, must investigate claims of improperly disposed
contaminants. We anticipate our utility and non-utility companies may periodically be included in
various types of environmental proceedings.

RISK FACTORS

There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE Energy’s utility and non-utility
businesses. To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy, we are
providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses.
Although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.
Each of the following risks could affect our performance.

Michigan’s electric Customer Choice program is negatively impacting our financial performance

. Even
with the Customer Choice-related rate relief received in Detroit Edison’s 2004 rate orders, there
continues to be considerable financial risk associated with the Customer Choice program. Choice
migration is sensitive to market price, transition charges and electric bundled price increases.

Weather significantly affects our utility operations

.

Deviations from normal hot and cold weather
conditions affect our earnings and cash flow. Mild temperatures can result in decreased
utilization of our assets, lowering income and cash flow. Damage due to ice storms, tornadoes, or
high winds can damage our infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur
material unplanned expenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be recoverable
through the regulatory process.

Our electric utility continues to be negatively affected by competition.

Deregulation and
restructuring in the electric industry has resulted in increased competition and unrecovered costs
that have affected and may continue to affect our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. We are a regulated public utility, and this regulation has hindered our ability to
retain customers in a competitive marketplace.

We are subject to rate regulation

. We operate in a regulated industry. Our electric and gas rates
are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. We may
be impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies.
New legislation, regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates, impact our
ability to recover costs through rate increases or require us to incur additional expenses.

Our ability to utilize Section 29 tax credits may be limited.

We have generated Section 29 tax
credits from our synfuel, coke battery, biomass and gas production operations. We have received
favorable private letter rulings on all of our synfuel facilities. All Section 29 tax credits
taken after 1997 are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If our Section 29 tax
credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could be additional
tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows. The value of future
credits



generated may be affected by new tax legislation. Moreover, Section 29 tax credits related
to generation of synfuels expire at the end of 2007. The combination of overall industry audits of
Section 29 tax credits, supply and demand for investment in credit producing activities and new tax
legislation could have an impact on our earnings and cash flows. We have also provided certain
guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in our synfuel facilities.

In addition, the value of a Section 29 tax credit in a given year is reduced if the “Reference
Price” of oil within the year exceeds a threshold price and is eliminated entirely if the Reference
Price exceeds a phase-out price. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the
annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil, which in recent years has been $3
- - $4 lower than the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price for light, sweet crude oil.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us.

Increased scrutiny of the energy
industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic performance could result in
credit agencies reexamining our credit rating. A credit agency currently has a “negative outlook”
on our ratings. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such
ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating could
restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our
borrowing costs. In addition, a reduction in credit rating may require us to post collateral
related to various trading contracts, which would impact our liquidity.

Regional and national economic conditions may unfavorably impact us.

Our businesses follow the
economic cycles of the customers we serve. Should national or regional economic conditions
decline, reduced volumes of electricity and gas we supply will result in decreased earnings and
cash flow. Economic conditions in our service territory also impact our collections of accounts
receivable and financial results.

Environmental laws and liability may be costly.

We are subject to numerous environmental
regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and
disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can significantly
increase capital spending, operating expenses and plant down times. These laws and regulations
require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other regulatory
approvals. We may also incur liabilities because of our emission of gases that may cause changes in
the climate. The regulatory environment is subject to significant change and, therefore, we cannot
predict future issues.

Additionally, we may become a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a
regulatory body. We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures
related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs. There is
also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several
liability on all potentially responsible parties.

Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory
process, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.

Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk.

Ownership of an operating nuclear generating
plant subjects Detroit Edison to significant additional risks. These risks among others, include
plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, and operational factors that can
significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility. While Detroit
Edison maintains insurance for various nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such
insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business
interruption at our nuclear generating plant, which may affect our financial performance.

The supply and price of fuel and other commodities may impact our financial results.

We are
dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuation and coal and
other fuel supply disruptions could have a negative impact on our ability to profitably generate
electricity. Our



access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for
our utility gas customers. We have hedging strategies in place to mitigate negative fluctuations
in commodity supply prices but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not
be negatively impacted by price fluctuations. The price of natural gas also impacts the market for
distributed generation products and other non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and
alternative energy suppliers.

A work interruption may adversely affect us.

Unions represent a majority of our employees. A union
choosing to strike as a negotiating tactic would have an impact on our business.

Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.

Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely
produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations. Our financial performance may be
negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs.

Our ability to access capital markets at attractive interest rates is important.

Our ability to
access capital markets is important to operate our businesses. Heightened concerns about the energy
industry, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit
our access to capital markets. Changes in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs and
negatively impact our financial performance.

We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.

Cash flows from subsidiaries are required to pay
interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities. Should a major subsidiary not
be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, our ability to pay dividends and
interest would be restricted.

Property tax reform may be costly

. We are one of the largest payers of property taxes in the State
of Michigan. Should the legislature change how schools are financed, we could face increased
property taxes on our Michigan facilities.

We may not be fully covered by insurance.

While we have a comprehensive insurance program in place
to provide coverage for various types of risks, catastrophic damage as a result of acts of God,
terrorism, war or a combination of significant unforeseen events could impact our operations and
economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance.

Terrorism could affect our business

. Damage to downstream infrastructure or our own assets by
terrorist groups would impact our operations. We have increased security as a result of recent
events and further security increases are expected.

Failure to successfully implement new information systems could interrupt our operations.

Our
businesses depend on numerous information systems for operations and financial information and
billings. We are in the process of launching the first phase of our DTE2 project, a multiyear
Company-wide initiative to improve existing processes and implement new core information systems.
Failure to successfully implement DTE2 and other new systems could interrupt our operations.

Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to additional risk

.

Events in the energy
trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy
industry as a whole. A decline in the confidence in the energy trading market along with stricter
credit requirements has led to a decrease in the number of trading entities resulting in decreased
liquidity in the energy trading market. Also, in certain situations we may be required to post
collateral to support trading operations.

their respective successors are chosen and qualified. With the exception of Messrs. Ewing and
Peterson, all of the above officers have been employed by DTE Energy in one or more management
capacities during the past five years.

Stephen E. Ewing was elected group president for DTE Energy Gas on May 31, 2001. He joined DTE
Energy having previously served as president and chief operating officer of MCN Energy and
president and chief executive officer of MichCon during the previous five years.

Bruce D. Peterson was elected Senior Vice President and General Counsel on June 25, 2002. Mr.
Peterson was a partner with Hunton & Williams in Washington, D.C. prior to joining DTE Energy.

Pursuant to Article VI of our Articles of Incorporation, directors of DTE Energy will not be
personally liable to the Company or its shareholders in the performance of their duties to the full
extent permitted by law.

Article VII of our Articles of Incorporation provides that each current or former director or
officer of DTE Energy, or each current and former employee or agent of the Company or a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (including the heirs, executors, administrators or estate of such person), shall be
indemnified by the Company to the full extent



permitted by the Michigan Business Corporation Act or any other applicable laws as presently or
hereafter in effect. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with all of our
officers and directors, these agreements set forth procedures for claims for indemnification as
well as contractually obligating us to provide indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by
law.

We and our directors and officers in their capacities as such are insured against liability for
alleged wrongful acts (to the extent defined) under seven insurance policies providing aggregate
coverage in the amount of $165 million.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

We are involved in certain legal, regulatory, administrative and environmental proceedings
before various courts, arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in
the ordinary course of business. These proceedings include certain contract disputes,
environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and pending
judicial matters. We cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. We regularly
review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss. The
resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or
financial statements in the period they are resolved.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

DTE Energy is a diversified energy company with approximately $7 billion in revenues in 2004
and approximately $21 billion in assets at December 31, 2004. We are the parent company of Detroit
Edison and MichCon, regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of
providing electricity and natural gas sales and distribution services throughout southeastern
Michigan. Additionally, we have numerous non-utility subsidiaries involved in energy-related
businesses predominantly in the Midwest and eastern U.S.

A significant portion of our earnings is derived from our utility operations, synthetic fuel
business, and energy marketing and trading operations. Earnings in 2004 were $431 million, or $2.49
per diluted share, down from 2003 earnings of $521 million, or $3.09 per diluted share. As
discussed in the “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” section that follows, the comparability of earnings was
impacted by discontinued businesses and the adoption of new accounting rules. Excluding
discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, earnings from continuing
operations in 2004 were $443 million, or $2.55 per diluted share, compared to earnings of $480
million, or $2.85 per diluted share for the same 2003 period. Income reflects reduced contributions
from our utility operations, partially offset by increased contributions from our non-utility
businesses and Corporate & Other. Significant items that influenced our 2004 financial performance
and/or may affect future results are:

•

Electric Customer Choice penetration;

•

Electric and gas rate orders;

•

Higher operating costs;

•

Weather;

•

Synfuel-related earnings and the risk of higher oil prices; and

•

Growth of non-utility businesses.

Electric Customer Choice Program

- Since 2002, Michigan residents and businesses have had the
option of participating in the electric Customer Choice program. This program is designed to give
all customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower power costs resulting from
competition. However, Detroit Edison’s rates are regulated by the Michigan Public Service
Commission (MPSC), while alternative suppliers can charge market-based rates. This regulation has
hindered Detroit Edison’s ability to retain customers. In addition, the MPSC has maintained
regulated rates for certain groups of customers that exceed the cost of service to those customers.
This has resulted in high levels of participation in the electric Customer Choice program by those
customers that have the highest rates relative to their cost of service, primarily commercial and
industrial businesses. As a result, our margins continue to be affected. To address this issue, we
filed a revenue neutral rate restructuring proposal in February 2005 designed to adjust rates for
each customer class to be reflective of the full costs incurred to service such customers. Under
the proposal, Detroit Edison’s commercial and industrial rates would be lowered in 2006, but
residential rates would increase over a five-year period beginning in 2007. The number and mix of
customers participating in the electric Customer Choice program could be impacted under the rate
restructuring.

Lost margins and electricity volumes associated with electric Customer Choice were approximately
$237 million and 9,245 gigawatthours (gWh) in 2004. This compares with lost electric Customer
Choice margins and volumes of approximately $120 million and 6,193 gWh in 2003. The financial
impact of electric Customer Choice was affected by the issuance of electric interim and final rate
orders that increased base rates, authorized transition charges and reaffirmed the resumption of
the Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR) mechanism, as subsequently discussed. Partially offsetting
the impact of lost margins on income, we recorded regulatory assets representing stranded costs that we believe are



recoverable under existing Michigan legislation and MPSC orders. There are a number of variables
and estimates that impact the level of recoverable stranded costs, including weather, sales mix and
transition charges. As a result, our estimate of stranded costs could increase or decrease. As
subsequently discussed, the MPSC authorized the recovery of $44 million in stranded costs for the
period of January 2002 through February 2004.

Detroit Edison rate orders, along with the rate restructuring proposal, address certain issues with
the electric Customer Choice program. However, current regulation continues to hinder our ability
to retain certain customers. Accordingly, we will continue working with the MPSC and Michigan
legislature to address other issues associated with the electric Customer Choice program.

Electric Rate Orders

- In 2000, Public Act (PA) 141 froze electric rates for all residential,
commercial and industrial customers through 2003. The legislation also prevented rate increases
(or capped rates) for small commercial and industrial customers through 2004 and for residential
customers through 2005. The rate freeze and caps apply to base rates as well as rates designed to
recover fuel and purchased power costs which has traditionally been a cost pass-through under the
power supply cost recovery (PSCR) mechanism.

In 2004, the MPSC issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases
totaling $374 million, and eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for
electric Customer Choice customers. The increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a
rate cap. The interim order affirmed the resumption of the PSCR mechanism for both capped and
uncapped customers, which reduced PSCR revenues by $115 million in 2004. However, the order
allowed Detroit Edison to increase base rates for customers still subject to a cap in an equal and
offsetting amount to the change in the PSCR factor to maintain the total capped rate levels in
effect for these customers. The MPSC also authorized the recovery of approximately $385 million in
regulatory assets, including stranded costs.

As a result of rate caps, regulatory asset adjustments and other factors, the rate orders decreased
2004 earnings by $15 million. The impact of the rate orders is expected to increase earnings in
2005 and 2006 as rate caps expire.

See Note 4 for a further discussion of the MPSC’s interim and final rate orders.

Gas Interim Rate Order

- In September 2003, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for an
increase in service and distribution charges (base rates) for its gas sales and transportation
customers. The filing requested an overall increase in base rates of $194 million annually
(approximately 7% increase, inclusive of gas costs), beginning January 1, 2005. In September 2004,
MichCon received an interim order in this rate case authorizing an increase in base rates of $35
million annually, effective September 22, 2004. The interim rate order increased earnings by approximately $6 million in 2004. MichCon
expects a final order from the MPSC in the first quarter of 2005.



Operating Costs

- During 2004, we experienced increases in operation and maintenance costs,
primarily within our electric and gas utilities. The increases were driven by higher costs
associated with pension and postretirement benefits and uncollectible accounts receivable.

Pension and postretirement benefits expense totaled $212 million in 2004, compared to $172 million
in 2003. The increase is due to financial market performance, lower discount rates and increased
health care trend rates. We have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit
plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs. Additionally, the recoverability of pension
and health care benefits costs were part of our electric and gas rate filings. The MPSC approved a
pension tracking mechanism in Detroit Edison’s final rate order that provides for the recovery or
refunding of pension costs above or below the amount reflected in base rates. The MPSC also
required Detroit Edison to propose a similar tracking mechanism for retiree health care costs.
Detroit Edison filed a request with the MPSC in February 2005 seeking authority to implement a
tracking mechanism for retiree health care costs.

Both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables, especially within our
Energy Gas operations. The increase is attributable to economic conditions, high natural gas
prices and the lack of adequate levels of assistance for low-income customers. As a result of
these factors, our allowance for doubtful accounts expense for the two utilities increased to $105
million in 2004 compared to $76 million for the corresponding 2003 period. We are taking
aggressive actions to reduce the level of past due receivables, including customer disconnections,
contracting with collection agencies and working with the State of Michigan and others to increase
the share of low-income funding allocated to our customers.

In MichCon’s current gas rate filing, we addressed numerous operating cost issues, including
uncollectible accounts receivable expense. The MPSC Staff supports a provision proposed by MichCon
that would allow MichCon to recover or refund 90% of uncollectible accounts receivable expense
above or below the amount that is reflected in base rates. We support the MPSC Staff’s
recommendation and believe the provision would significantly reduce our risk of high uncollectible
gas accounts receivable.

To partially address this issue of rising costs, we continue to employ the DTE Energy Operating
System, which is the application of tools and practices to obtain operating efficiencies and
enhance operating performance. We are targeting over $100 million in savings during 2005 through
the application of Operating System principles.

Weather

- Earnings in our electric and gas utilities are seasonal and sensitive to weather.
Electric utility earnings are dependent on hot summer weather, while the gas utility’s results are
driven by cold winter weather. We experienced both milder summer and winter weather during 2004,
which negatively impacted sales demand. The lower demand reduced current year earnings by $27
million compared to 2003.

Additionally, we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric
distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages. The impact of storms on our current year
earnings was significantly lower than in 2003, which was affected by several catastrophic wind and
ice storms, as well as by the August 2003 blackout. Restoration and other costs associated with
storm-related power outages lowered 2004 pretax earnings by $48 million compared to $72 million in
2003.

Synthetic Fuel Operations

- We operate nine synthetic fuel production plants at eight locations.
Since 2002, we have sold majority interests in eight of the nine plants, representing approximately
92% of our total production capacity. Synfuel facilities chemically change coal, including waste
and marginal coal, into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) rules. Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code provides tax credits for the production and
sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal. Synfuel-related tax credits expire in December
2007.

Operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and therefore
generate operating losses, which have been more than offset by the resulting Section 29 tax
credits. In order to



recognize Section 29 tax credits, a taxpayer must have sufficient taxable
income in the year the tax credit is generated. Once earned, the tax credits are utilized subject
to certain limitations but can be carried forward indefinitely. We have not had sufficient taxable
income to fully utilize tax credits earned in prior periods. As of December 2004, we had $483
million in tax credit carry-forwards. In order to optimize income and cash flow from our synfuel
operations, we have sold majority interests in eight of our nine facilities and intend to sell a
majority interest in the remaining plant during 2005, representing 99% of our production capacity.
When we sell an interest in a synfuel project, we recognize the gain from such sale as the facility
produces and sells synfuel and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have
become fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Gain recognition is
dependent on the synfuel production qualifying for Section 29 tax credits and the value of such
credits as subsequently discussed. In substance, we are receiving synfuel gains and reduced
operating losses in exchange for tax credits associated with the projects sold. Sales of interests
in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable income base.

The value of a Section 29 tax credit can vary each year and is adjusted annually by an inflation
factor as published by the IRS in April of the following year. Additionally, the value of the tax
credit in a given year is reduced if the “Reference Price” of oil within the year exceeds a
threshold price and is eliminated entirely if the Reference Price exceeds a phase-out price. The
Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel
for domestic crude oil, which in recent years has been $3 — $4 lower than the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX) price for light, sweet crude oil. The actual or estimated Reference Price and
beginning and ending phase-out prices per barrel of oil for 2003, 2004 and 2005 are as follows:

Numerous recent events have significantly increased domestic crude oil prices, including
terrorism, storm-related supply disruptions and strong worldwide demand. As of February 1, 2005,
the NYMEX closing price of a barrel of oil to be delivered in March 2005 was $47.12, which is
comparable to a $43.47 Reference Price (assuming that such price was to continue for an entire
year). For 2005 and later years, if the Reference Price falls within or exceeds the phase-out
range, the availability of tax credits in that year would be reduced or eliminated, respectively.

As previously discussed, until the gain recognition criteria is met, gains from selling interests
in synfuel facilities will be deferred. It is possible that gains will be deferred in the first,
second and/or third quarters of each year until there is persuasive evidence that no tax credit
phase out will occur for the applicable calendar year. This could result in shifting earnings from
earlier quarters to later quarters of a calendar year.

As discussed in Notes 12 and 13, we have entered into derivative and other contracts to
economically hedge approximately 65% of our 2005 synfuel cash flow exposure related to the risk of
an increase in oil prices. We are continuing to evaluate the current volatility in oil prices and
alternatives available to mitigate our unhedged exposure to oil prices as part of our
synfuel-related risk management strategy.

Assuming no synfuel tax credit phase out in future years, we expect cash flow from our synfuel
business to total approximately $1.6 billion between 2005 and 2008. The source of synfuel cash
flow includes cash from operations, asset sales, and the utilization of Section 29 tax credits
carried forward from synfuel production prior to 2004.

Non-utility Growth

- During 2004, we continued to experience growth in our non-utility
businesses with income reaching $283 million compared to $256 million in 2003. The improvement
primarily reflects increased contributions in our Energy Marketing & Trading segment, primarily due
to a one-time contract gain. Additionally, non-utility growth in 2004 is attributable to increased
earnings from our synfuels, coke



batteries and on-site energy projects. Also affecting the year over year comparison are asset
gains, losses and impairments during 2004 and 2003 as subsequently discussed.

Outlook

- We made significant progress during the past year on our 2004 corporate priorities, which
included:

•

Successful rate case outcomes;

•

Addressing structural issues with the electric Customer Choice program;

•

Continuing sell-down of synfuel portfolio;

•

Continuing non-utility growth momentum; and

•

Maintaining cash and balance sheet strength.

Our long-term strategy has not changed and in 2005 we will focus on maintaining a strong utility
base, pursuing a unique growth strategy focused on value creation in targeted markets, maintaining
a strong balance sheet and paying an attractive dividend. The impact of the rate orders is expected
to increase utility earnings in 2005 and 2006 as rate caps expire.

Our financial performance will be dependent on successfully redeploying an expected $1.65 billion
of cash flow through 2008, primarily associated with proceeds from the sale of interests in synfuel
facilities. Our objective for cash redeployment is to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage
ratios, as well as replace the value of synfuels that is currently inherent in our share price. We
will first use our cash to reduce parent company debt. Secondly, we will continue to pursue growth
investments that meet our strict risk-return and value creation criteria. Lastly, share
repurchases will be used to build share value if adequate investment opportunities are not
available.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We had earnings of $431 million in 2004, or $2.49 per diluted share, compared to earnings of
$521 million, or $3.09 per diluted share in 2003 and earnings of $632 million, or $3.83 per
diluted share in 2002. As subsequently discussed, the comparability of earnings was impacted by our
two discontinued businesses, International Transmission Company and Southern Missouri Gas Company,
and the adoption of two new accounting rules in 2003. Excluding discontinued operations and the
cumulative effect of accounting changes, our earnings from continuing operations in 2004 were $443
million, or $2.55 per diluted share, compared to earnings of $480 million, or $2.85 per diluted
share in 2003 and earnings of $586 million, or $3.55 per diluted share in 2002. The following
sections provide a detailed discussion of our segments, operating performance and future outlook.

Segment Performance & Outlook

– Through 2004, we operated our businesses through three strategic
business units (Energy Resources, Energy Distribution and Energy Gas). Each business unit had
utility and non-utility operations. The balance of our business consisted of Corporate & Other.
This resulted in the following reportable segments. In 2005, we expect to realign our business
units as discussed in Note 1.

ENERGY RESOURCES

Utility — Power Generation

The power generation plants of Detroit Edison comprise our regulated power generation business.
Detroit Edison’s numerous fossil plants, its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear
plant generate electricity. The generated electricity, supplemented with purchased power, is sold
principally throughout Michigan and the Midwest to residential, commercial, industrial and
wholesale customers.

Factors impacting income:

Power Generation earnings decreased $173 million in 2004 and $6 million
in 2003, compared to the prior year. As subsequently discussed, these results primarily reflect
reduced gross margins and increased operation and maintenance expenses.

Gross margins

declined $186 million during 2004 and $135 million in 2003. The declines were
due primarily to lost margins from retail customers choosing to purchase power from alternative
suppliers under the electric Customer Choice program as well as reduced cooling demand resulting
from mild summer weather. As a result of electric Customer Choice penetration, Detroit Edison lost
18% of retail sales in 2004, compared to 12% of such sales during 2003. The loss of retail sales
under the electric Customer Choice program also resulted in lower purchase power requirements, as
well as excess power capacity that was sold in the wholesale market. Under the 2004 interim and
final rate orders previously discussed, revenues from selling excess power reduce the level of
recoverable fuel and purchased power costs and therefore do not impact margins associated with
uncapped customers. The rate orders also lowered PSCR revenues, which were partially offset by
increased base rate and transition charge revenues.

Weather in 2004 was 3% milder than 2003, resulting in lost margins of $25 million. Weather in 2003
was also milder than the prior year, resulting in lost margins of $114 million. The decline in
margins and revenues in 2004 was also due to the allocation of a smaller portion of Detroit
Edison’s billings to Power Generation.

Operating revenues and fuel and purchased power costs decreased in 2004 and 2003 reflecting a
$1.27 per megawatt hour (MWh) (8%) decline in fuel and purchased power costs during 2004 and a $.64
per MWh (4%) decline during 2003. Fuel and purchased power costs are a pass-through with the
reinstatement of the PSCR in 2004, and therefore do not affect margins or earnings associated with
uncapped customers. The decrease in fuel and purchased power costs is attributable to lower priced
purchases and the use of a more favorable power supply mix driven by higher generation output. The
favorable mix is due to lower purchases, driven by lost sales under the electric Customer Choice
program. The comparison was also



affected by higher costs associated with substitute power purchased to meet customer demand during
the August 2003 blackout. We were required to purchase additional power during the 36-day period
it took for our generation fleet to return to pre-blackout capacity.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased $44 million in 2004 and $2 million in 2003. The
2004 increase reflects costs associated with maintaining our generation fleet, including costs of
scheduled and forced plant outages. Additionally, the increase in 2004 is due to incremental costs
associated with the implementation of our DTE2 project, a Company-wide initiative to improve
existing processes and to implement new core information systems, including finance, human
resources, supply chain and work management. Operation and maintenance expense in both years
includes higher employee pension and health care benefit costs due to financial market performance,
discount rates and health care trend rates. Expenses in 2003 were also affected by $5 million in
costs associated with the August 2003 blackout.

Depreciation and amortization

expense increased $48 million in 2004 and decreased $107 million in
2003. The variations reflect the income effect of recording regulatory assets, which lowered
depreciation and amortization expenses. The regulatory asset deferrals totaled $107 million in 2004
and $153 million in 2003, representing net stranded costs and other costs we believe are
recoverable under PA 141.

Other income and deductions

expense increased $17 million in 2004 and decreased $40 million in
2003. The 2004 increase is primarily due to lower income associated with recording a return on
regulatory assets, as well as costs associated with addressing the structural issues of PA 141.
The 2003 decrease is attributable to lower interest expenses and increased interest income.
Interest expense reflects lower borrowing levels and rates, and interest income includes the
accrual of carrying charges on environmental-related regulatory assets.

Outlook

– Future operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as
regulatory proceedings, new legislation, changes in market prices of power, coal and gas, plant
performance, changes in economic conditions, weather and the levels of customer participation in
the electric Customer Choice program.



As previously discussed, we expect cash flows and operating performance will continue to be at risk
due to the electric Customer Choice program until the issues associated with this program are
addressed. We will accrue as regulatory assets our unrecovered generation-related fixed costs
(stranded costs) due to electric Customer Choice that we believe are recoverable under Michigan
legislation and MPSC orders. We have addressed certain issues of the electric Customer Choice
program in our February 2005 rate restructuring proposal. We cannot predict the outcome of these
matters.

In conjunction with the sale of the transmission assets of ITC in February 2003, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) froze ITC’s transmission rates through December 2004. It is expected
that annual rate adjustments pursuant to a formulistic pricing mechanism beginning in January 2005
will result in an estimated increase in Detroit Edison’s transmission expense of $50 million
annually. Additionally, in a proceeding before the FERC, several Midwest utilities seek to recover
transmission revenues lost as a result of a FERC order modifying the pricing of transmission
service in the Midwest. Detroit Edison estimates that its potential obligation as a result of this
proceeding could be $2.2 million per month from December 2004 through March 2005 and $1 million per
month from April 2005 through March 2006. Detroit Edison is
expected to incur an additional $15 million in 2005 for charges
related to the implementation of Midwest Independent Transmission
Operator’s open market. As previously discussed, Detroit Edison received rate
orders in 2004 that allow for the recovery of increased transmission expenses through the PSCR
mechanism.

See Note 4 – Regulatory Matters.

Energy Services

Energy Services is comprised of Coal-Based Fuels, On-Site Energy Projects and non-utility Power
Generation. Coal-Based Fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants
and producing coke from three coke battery plants. The production of synthetic fuel from all of
our synfuel plants and the production of coke from one of our coke batteries generate tax credits
under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. On-Site Energy Projects include pulverized coal
injection, power generation, steam production, chilled water production, wastewater treatment and
compressed air supply. Power Generation owns and operates four gas-fired peaking electric
generating plants and manages and operates two additional gas-fired power plants under contract.
Additionally, Power Generation develops, operates and acquires coal and gas-fired generation.

Factors impacting income

: Energy Services earnings decreased $11 million in 2004 and increased $17
million in 2003, compared to the prior year. As subsequently discussed, these results primarily
reflect higher gains recognized from selling majority interests in our synfuel plants, varying
levels of Section 29 tax credits, a gain from contract termination, uncollectible accounts
written-off and losses on synfuel hedges.

Operating revenues

increased $160 million in 2004 and $284 million in 2003 reflecting higher
synfuel, coal and coke sales, as well as increased revenues from our on-site energy projects.

The improvement in synfuel revenues results from increased production due to additional sales of
project interests in 2004 and 2003, reflecting our strategy to produce synfuel primarily from
plants in which we had sold interests in order to optimize income and cash flow. As previously
discussed, operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and
therefore generate operating losses, which have been more than offset by the resulting Section 29
tax credits. When we sell an interest in a synfuel project, we recognize the gain from such sale as
the facility produces and sells synfuel and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales
proceeds to the Company have become fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
In substance, we are receiving synfuel gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax
credits associated with the projects sold.

Coal marketing revenues in 2004 have also been affected by our strategy to produce synfuel
primarily from plants in which we had sold interests. This strategy resulted in the reduction of
synfuel production levels. We were contractually obligated to supply coal to customers at certain
sites that did not produce synfuel as a result of our current production strategy. To meet our
obligations to provide coal under long-term contracts with customers, we acquired coal that was
resold to customers. The coal was sold at prices higher than the prices at which synfuel would
have been sold to these customers.



Revenues from coke sales were higher in 2004, due to higher coke sales volumes combined with higher
market prices, due to limited supplies of coke in the U.S.

Revenues from on-site energy projects increased in 2004, reflecting the completion of new long-term
utility services contracts with a large automotive company and a large manufacturer of paper
products. Revenues in 2004 include a $9 million pre-tax fee generated in conjunction with the
development of a related energy project, 50% of which was sold to an unaffiliated partner.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased $139 million in 2004 and $341 million in 2003,
reflecting costs associated with synfuel production and coke operations. Partially offsetting the
higher synfuel operating costs in 2004 was the recording of insurance proceeds associated with an
accident at one of our coke batteries. Operation and maintenance expense in 2003 was affected by a
$30 million pre-tax gain from the termination of a tolling agreement at one of our generation
facilities, substantially offset by the establishment of a $28 million pre-tax reserve for
receivables associated with a large customer that filed for bankruptcy.

Gains on sale of interests in synfuel projects

increased $136 million in 2004 and $43 million in
2003. The improvements are due to additional sales of majority interests in our synfuel projects.
To hedge our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce synfuel sales
proceeds, we entered into derivative and other contracts covering approximately 65% of our 2005
synfuel cash flow exposure. The derivative contracts are accounted for under the mark to market
method with changes in their fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains. We recorded a
mark to market loss during the 2004 fourth quarter, which reduced 2004 synfuel gains by $12 million
pre-tax. See Note 12 for further discussion.

Minority interest

increased $121 million in 2004 and $54 million in 2003, reflecting our partners’
share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations. The sale of interests in our synfuel
facilities during 2004 and 2003 resulted in allocating a larger percentage of such losses to our
partners.

Income taxes

increased $313 million in 2004 and $19 million in 2003, reflecting higher taxable
earnings and a decline in the level of Section 29 tax credits due to the sale of interests in
synfuel facilities.

Outlook

- Energy Services will continue leveraging its extensive energy-related operating
experience and project management capability to develop and grow the on-site energy business. We
expect solid earnings from our on-site energy business in 2005 as a result of executing long-term
utility services contracts in 2004.

Energy Marketing & Trading

Energy Marketing & Trading consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading operations of DTE
Energy Trading and CoEnergy. DTE Energy Trading focuses on physical power marketing and structured
transactions, as well as the enhancement of returns from DTE Energy’s power plants. CoEnergy
focuses on physical gas marketing and the optimization of DTE Energy’s owned and contracted natural
gas pipelines and gas storage capacity. To this end, both companies enter into derivative
financial instruments as part of their marketing and hedging strategies, including forwards,
futures, swaps and option contracts. Most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted
for under the mark to market method, which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and
losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives.

Factors impacting income

: Energy Marketing & Trading’s earnings increased $47 million in 2004,
consisting of a $4 million improvement at DTE Energy Trading and a $43 million improvement at
CoEnergy. Earnings increased $20 million in 2003, of which $18 million was attributable to DTE
Energy Trading and $2 million to CoEnergy.

DTE Energy Trading’s earnings improvement in 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to realized margins
associated with short-term physical trading and origination activities.

CoEnergy’s earnings in 2004 and 2003 were affected by varying gains and losses on economic
hedge contracts related to storage assets. As subsequently discussed in the “

Outlook

” section, the
unrealized gains and losses of economic hedge contracts are required to be recognized under
mark-to-market accounting, while the offsetting unrealized losses and gains on the underlying asset
positions are not recognized.

CoEnergy’s earnings in 2004 reflect a $74 million one-time pre-tax gain from modifying a future
purchase commitment under a transportation agreement and terminating a related long-term gas
exchange (storage) agreement with an interstate pipeline company. Under the gas exchange agreement,
we received gas from the customer during the summer injection period and redelivered the gas during
the winter heating season.

The realized and unrealized margins comparison for both DTE Energy Trading and CoEnergy was
affected by our decision in late 2003 to monetize certain in-the-money derivative contracts while
simultaneously entering into replacement at-the-market contracts. The monetizations were completed
in conjunction with implementing a series of initiatives to improve cash flow and fully utilize
Section 29 tax



credits. Although the monetizations did not impact earnings, they had the effect of
decreasing realized margins and increasing unrealized margins on economic hedges in 2004, and
having the opposite effect on margins in 2003.

Outlook

– Energy Marketing & Trading will seek to manage its business in a manner consistent with,
and complementary to, the growth of our other business segments. Gas storage and transportation
capacity enhances our ability to provide reliable and custom-tailored bundled services to
large-volume end users and utilities. This capacity, coupled with the synergies from DTE Energy’s
other businesses, positions the segment to add value.

Significant portions of the Energy Marketing & Trading portfolio are economically hedged. The
portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory, as well as owned and contracted natural
gas pipelines and storage assets. The financial instruments are deemed derivatives, whereas the
gas inventory, pipelines and storage assets are not considered derivatives for accounting purposes.
As a result, Energy Marketing & Trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are
marked to market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. The majority
of such earnings volatility is associated with the natural gas storage cycle, which runs annually
from April of one year to March of the next year. Our strategy is to economically hedge the price
risk of all gas purchases for storage with sales in the over-the-counter (forwards) and futures
markets. Current accounting rules require the marking to market of forward sales and futures, but
do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory. This results in gains and
losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods. We anticipate the
financial impact of this timing difference will reverse by the end of each storage cycle. See
“Fair Value of Contracts” section that follows.

Non-utility — Other

Our other non-utility businesses include our Coal Services and Biomass units. Coal Services
provides fuel, transportation and rail equipment management services. We specialize in minimizing
fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energy-intensive customers. Additionally, we
participate in coal trading and coal-to-power tolling transactions, as well as the purchase and
sale of emissions credits. Coal Services has formed a subsidiary, DTE PepTec Inc., which uses
proprietary technology to produce high quality coal products from fine coal slurries typically
discarded from coal mining operations. Biomass develops, owns and operates landfill recovery
systems in the U.S. Gas produced from many of these landfill sites qualifies for Section 29 tax
credits.

Factors impacting income

: Earnings increased $3 million in 2004 and declined $9 million in 2003.
The 2004 increase reflects higher sales from coal and emissions credits, partially offset by
increased costs associated with our waste coal operations. The 2003 decline reflects reduced
marketing and tolling income as well as an increase in operating costs associated with ramping up
the DTE PepTec business. Our first waste coal facility in Ohio became operational in late 2003.

Outlook

– We expect to continue to grow our Coal Services and Biomass units. We believe a

and prove out this technology. Coal Services and Biomass have formed a new subsidiary to enter the
coal mine methane business. We purchased coal mine methane assets in Illinois at the end of 2004,
and expect to reconfigure equipment and restart operations by mid-2005.



The Section 29 tax credits generated by Biomass are subject to the same phase out risk if domestic
crude oil prices reach certain levels, as detailed in the synthetic fuel operations discussion.
See Note 13.

ENERGY DISTRIBUTION

Utility — Power Distribution

Power Distribution operations include the electric distribution services of Detroit Edison. Power
Distribution distributes electricity generated and purchased by Energy Resources and alternative
energy suppliers to Detroit Edison’s 2.1 million customers.

Factors impacting income

: Power Distribution earnings increased $71 million during 2004 and
decreased $94 million in 2003, compared to the prior year. As subsequently discussed, these results
primarily reflect varying operating revenues and operation and maintenance expenses as well as a
non-recurring loss recorded in 2003.

Operating revenues

increased $111 million in 2004, primarily due to an increase in base rates
resulting from the interim and final rate orders. The 2004 improvement is also attributable to
residential sales growth and the allocation of a higher portion of Detroit Edison’s billings to
Power Distribution, partially offset by the effects of milder weather. Operating revenues
decreased $96 million in 2003, reflecting mild summer weather and the impact of slower economic
conditions.

Operation and maintenance

expense decreased $1 million in 2004 and increased $75 million in 2003.
The operation and maintenance expense comparability was affected by 2003 restoration costs
associated with three catastrophic storms and the August 2003 blackout. Both years were also
affected by an increase in



reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable, reflecting high past due amounts attributable to
economic conditions, and an increase in employee benefit costs. Additionally, the comparisons
were affected by incremental costs associated with our DTE2 project implementation, a $22 million
pre-tax loss in 2003 from the sale of our steam heating business, and the accrual of refunds in
2004 and 2003 associated with transmission services.

Outlook

– Operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as weather,
changes in economic conditions and the severity and frequency of storms.

We experienced numerous catastrophic storms over the past few years. The effect of the storms on
annual earnings was partially offset by storm insurance. We have been unable to obtain storm
insurance at economical rates and as a result, we do not anticipate having insurance coverage at
levels that would significantly offset unplanned expenses from ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds
that damage our distribution infrastructure.

Non-Utility

Non-utility Energy Distribution operations consist of DTE Energy Technologies, which assembles,
markets, distributes and services distributed generation products, provides application
engineering, and monitors and manages on-site generation system operations.

Factors impacting income

: Non-utility results declined $4 million in 2004 and improved $1 million
in 2003. The 2004 decrease includes an impairment charge for an “other than temporary” decline in
the fair value of an investment in a joint venture that supplied certain distributed generation
equipment and materials to DTE Energy Technologies.

Outlook

– DTE Energy Technologies will focus on sales of proprietary pre-engineered and packaged
continuous generation products in key applications. This will likely result in near-term revenue
decline, but we anticipate gross profit margins will improve. Combined with continuing cost
reductions and resumption of sales growth, we believe these actions will lead to improved financial
performance in 2005.



ENERGY GAS

Utility — Gas Distribution

Gas Distribution operations include gas distribution services primarily provided by MichCon, our
gas utility that purchases, stores, distributes and sells natural gas to 1.2 million residential,
commercial and industrial customers located throughout Michigan.

Factors impacting income:

Gas Distribution’s earnings declined $9 million in 2004 and $37 million
in 2003, compared to the prior year. As subsequently discussed, results primarily reflect varying
gross margins, higher operation and maintenance expenses and a non-recurring loss recorded in 2003.

Gross margins

increased $22 million in 2004 and decreased $6 million in 2003, compared to the
prior year. The improvement in 2004 reflects the impact of interim rate relief and additional
margin from the acceleration of several midstream services contracts. Partially offsetting these
improvements were lower sales and end user transportation deliveries due to milder weather. The
gross margin comparison was also affected by a $26.5 million pre-tax reserve recorded in 2003 for
the potential disallowance in gas costs pursuant to an MPSC order in MichCon’s 2002 gas cost
recovery (GCR) plan case (Note 4). Operating revenues and cost of gas increased significantly in
2004 and 2003 reflecting higher gas prices, which are recoverable from customers through the GCR
mechanism.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased $29 million in 2004 and $74 million in 2003,
reflecting higher reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and pension and health care costs.
The increase in uncollectible accounts expense reflects high past due amounts attributable to an
increase in gas prices, continued weak economic conditions and a lack of adequate public assistance
for low-income customers.

Other income and deductions

expense increased $12 million in 2004 and decreased $5 million in 2003,
reflecting a 2003 gain on sale of interests in a series of real estate partnerships.

Income taxes

in 2004 and 2003 were impacted by lower earnings and favorably affected by an increase
in the amortization of tax benefits previously deferred in accordance with MPSC regulations.

Outlook

– Operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as
regulatory proceedings, weather and changes in economic conditions. Higher gas prices and economic
conditions have resulted in an increase in past due receivables. We believe our allowance for
doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates. However, failure to make continued progress in
collecting past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results. Energy assistance
programs funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan remain critical to MichCon’s
ability to control uncollectible accounts receivable expenses. We are working with the State of
Michigan and others to increase the share of funding allocated to our customers to be
representative of the number of low-income individuals in our service territory.

As a result of the continued increase in operating costs, MichCon filed a rate case in September
2003 to increase rates by $194 million annually to address future operating costs and other issues.
MichCon received an interim order in this rate case in September 2004 increasing rates by $35
million annually. The MPSC Staff has recommended a provision that would allow MichCon to recover
or refund 90% of uncollectible accounts receivable expense above or below the amount that is
reflected in base rates. See Note 4 – Regulatory Matters.

Non-utility

Non-utility operations include the Gas Production business and the Gas Storage, Pipelines &
Processing business. Our Gas Production business produces gas from proven reserves in northern
Michigan and sells the gas to the Energy Marketing & Trading segment. Gas Storage, Pipelines &
Processing has a partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline, seven carbon dioxide
processing facilities and a natural gas storage field, as well as lease rights to another natural
gas storage field. The assets of these businesses are well integrated with other DTE Energy
entities.

Factors impacting income

: Earnings decreased $8 million in 2004 and increased $3 million in
2003. The decline in 2004 is due to gains recorded in 2003 from selling our 16% pipeline interest
in the Portland Natural Gas Transmission System, as well as from selling certain gas properties.
Excluding those gains, income increased $2 million reflecting the acquisition of an additional 15%
ownership in the Vector



Pipeline in late 2003, increased sales of transportation capacity by Vector Pipeline and
increased storage sales throughout 2004.

Outlook

– We anticipate further expansion of our storage facilities and Vector pipeline to take
advantage of available growth opportunities. We are also seeking to secure markets for our 10.5%
interest in the Millennium Pipeline.

We expect to continue developing our gas production properties in northern Michigan and leverage
our experience in this area by pursuing investment opportunities in unconventional gas production
outside of Michigan. During 2004, we acquired approximately 50,000 leasehold acres in the southern
region of the Barnett shale in Texas, an area of increasing production. We began drilling test
wells in December 2004 and anticipate drilling a significant number of additional test wells in the
first half of 2005. Initial results from the test wells are expected in mid-2005. If the results
are successful, we could commit up to $350 million of capital over the next several
years to develop these properties.

CORPORATE & OTHER

Corporate & Other includes various corporate support functions such as accounting, legal and
information technology. As these functions essentially support the entire Company, their costs are
fully allocated to the various segments based on services utilized and therefore the effect of the
allocation on each segment can vary from year to year. Additionally, Corporate & Other holds
certain non-utility debt and investments, including assets held for sale and in emerging energy
technologies.

Factors impacting income

: Corporate & Other results improved $47 million in 2004, compared to a $1
million decline in 2003. The 2004 improvement was affected by a $14 million net of tax gain from
the sale of 3.5 million shares of Plug Power stock (Note 1), as well as lower Michigan Single
Business Taxes, resulting from tax saving initiatives. Results for 2003 include a $15 million cash
contribution to the DTE Energy Foundation, funded with proceeds received from the sale of ITC.
Corporate & Other also benefited from lower financing costs and increased intercompany interest
income in both periods.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Southern Missouri Gas Company (SMGC)

- We own SMGC, a public utility engaged in the
distribution, transmission and sale of natural gas in southern Missouri. In 2004, management
approved the marketing of SMGC for sale. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we
classified SMGC as a discontinued operation in 2004 and recognized a net of tax impairment loss of
approximately $7 million, representing the write-down to fair value of the assets of SMGC, less
costs to sell, and the write-off of allocated goodwill. In November 2004, we entered into a
definitive agreement providing for the sale of SMGC. Following receipt of regulatory approvals and
resolution of other contingencies, it is anticipated that the transaction will close in 2005.

International Transmission Company

- In February 2003, we sold ITC, our electric transmission
business, to affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Trimaran Capital Partners, LLC.
Accordingly, we classified ITC as a discontinued operation. The sale generated a preliminary net of
tax gain of $63 million in 2003. The gain was net of transaction costs, the portion of the gain
that was refundable to customers and the write off of approximately $44 million of allocated
goodwill. The gain was lowered to $58 million in 2004 under the MPSC’s November 2004 final rate
order that resulted in a revision of the applicable transaction costs and customer refund. We had
income from discontinued operations of $5 million in 2003.

See Note 3 for further discussion.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES

As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, on January 1, 2003, we adopted
new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations and energy trading activities. The cumulative
effect of



adopting these new accounting rules reduced 2003 earnings by $27 million. See Note 2 for further
discussion.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

DTE Energy and its subsidiaries require cash to operate and cash is provided by both
internally and externally generated sources. We manage our liquidity and capital resources to
maintain financial flexibility to meet our current and future cash flow needs.

Cash Requirements

We use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our non-utility
businesses, in addition to retiring and paying interest on long-term debt and paying dividends.
Our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing
businesses in 2005 of up to $1.1 billion. The capital needs of our utilities will increase due
primarily to environmental related expenditures.

Capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in 2005, primarily as a result of
DTE2 and environmental spending. We began implementing the DTE2 project in 2003. The Company
expects the project to incrementally cost approximately $150 million to $175 million.

The EPA ozone transport regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and
particulate air pollution will continue to impact us. Detroit Edison estimates that it will spend
approximately $100 million in 2005 and incur up to an additional $1.3 billion of future capital
expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy both existing and proposed new control
requirements. The full recovery of $550 million of environmental expenditures was authorized in the
MPSC’s November 2004 final rate order.

Non-utility capital spending will approximate $100 million to $300 million annually for the next
several years. Capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will depend on the
existence of opportunities that meet our strict risk-return and value creation criteria.

Debt maturing in 2005, excluding securitization debt, totals approximately $410 million.

We believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated
capital requirements.

Cash from Operating Activities

A majority of the Company’s operating cash flow is provided by our two utilities, which are
significantly influenced by factors such as weather, electric Customer Choice sales loss,
regulatory deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions and operating costs.

Our non-utility businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise and reflect a range
of operating profiles. The profiles vary from our synthetic fuels business, which we believe will
provide over $1.6 billion in cash through 2008, to new start-ups. These new start-ups include our
unconventional gas and waste coal recovery businesses, which we are growing and, if successful,
could require significant investments.

Although DTE Energy’s overall earnings were $431 million in 2004, cash from operations totaling
$995 million was up $45 million from the comparable 2003 period. The operating cash flow
comparison reflects an increase of over $300 million in net income, after adjusting for non-cash
items (depreciation, depletion, amortization, deferred taxes and gains), substantially offset by a
$259 million increase in working capital and other requirements. A portion of this improvement is
attributable to the change in our strategy to primarily produce synfuel from plants in which we
have sold interests. As previously discussed, synfuel projects generate operating losses, which
have been more than offset by tax credits that we have been unable to fully utilize, thereby
negatively affecting operating cash flow. Cash for working capital primarily reflects higher income
tax payments of $172 million in 2004, reflecting a different payment pattern of taxes in 2004
compared to 2003. The increase in working capital was mitigated by Company initiatives to improve
cash flow, including better inventory management, cash sales transactions, deferral of retirement
plan contributions and the utilization of letters of credit. Certain cash initiatives in 2003
lowered cash flow in 2004.



Our net operating cash flow in 2003 was $950 million, reflecting a $46 million decline from 2002.
The decrease was attributable to lower utility net income, after adjusting for non-cash items.
Partially offsetting the declines were lower working capital and other requirements reflecting
Company initiatives to improve cash flow and optimize synfuel operations. The improvement in 2003
working capital was achieved despite a $222 million contribution to our pension plans.

Outlook

– We expect cash flow from operations to increase over the long-term primarily due to
improvements from utility rate increases and the sales of interests in our synfuel projects. This
will be partially offset by higher cash requirements, primarily within our gas storage business. We
are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through cash improvement
initiatives.

Operating cash flow from our utilities is expected to increase in 2005, but will be affected by the
level of sales migration under the electric Customer Choice program and the ability of the MPSC
within the regulatory processes to put in place a Customer Choice program that has sound economic
fundamentals. In addition, the Customer Choice program’s impact will also be determined by the
success of the Company in addressing certain structural flaws within additional regulatory
proceedings and the legislative process.

Another factor affecting utility cash flows is the degree and timing of rate relief within the
electric and gas rate cases. Based on the final and interim orders issued by the MPSC in 2004,
approximately $50 million of additional revenues were realized in the 2004 calendar year. Due to
the structure of the interim and final rate orders, we will not realize the full benefits of
interim and final rate relief until 2006 when all customer rate caps expire.

Improvements in cash flow from our utilities are also expected from better management of our
working capital requirements, including the continued focus on reducing past due accounts
receivable. Our emphasis in these businesses will continue to be centered around cash generation
and conservation.

Cash flows from our synfuel business are expected to total approximately $1.6 billion between 2005
and 2008. The redeployment of this cash
represents a unique opportunity to increase shareholder value and strengthen our balance sheet. We
expect to use this cash to reduce debt, to continue to pursue growth investments that meet our
strict risk-return and value creation criteria and to potentially repurchase common stock if
adequate investment opportunities are not available. Our objectives for cash redeployment are to
strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios in order to improve our current credit ratings and
outlook, and to more than replace the value of synfuels.

Cash
flows from our synfuel business are expected to
approximate $400 million in 2005. The source of synfuel cash
flow includes cash from operations (excluding certain working
capital changes),
asset sales, and the utilization of Section 29 tax credits carried forward from synfuel production
prior to 2004.

Our other operating non-utility businesses are expected to contribute approximately $400 million
through 2008. Remaining start-up businesses such as unconventional gas production, waste coal
recovery and distributed generation will continue to use cash in excess of their cash generation
over the next couple of years while they are being further developed. Certain of the previously
discussed cash initiatives resulted in accelerating the receipt of cash in 2004, which will have
the impact of lowering cash flow in 2005.

Cash from Investing Activities

Cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of
assets. In any given year, we will look to harvest cash from under-performing or non-strategic
assets. Capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and
distribution infrastructure, comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements.
Capital spending within our non-utility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and some expansion.
The balance of non-utility spending is for growth, which we manage very carefully. We look to make
investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks and returns.
All new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted
basis. We have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will



not make investments unless they meet our criteria. For new business lines, we invest tentatively
based on research and analysis. Based on a limited investment, we evaluate results and either
expand or exit the business based on those results. In any given year, the amount of growth
capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the Company with a clear understanding
of any potential impact on our credit ratings.

Net cash relating to investing activities declined $691 million in 2004 and improved $1.1 billion
in 2003, compared to the prior year. The changes were primarily due to proceeds received in 2003
totaling $758 million from the sale of ITC, interests in three synfuel projects and non-strategic
assets. Additionally, the changes are due to variations in cash contractually designated for debt
service.

Longer term, with the expected improvement at our utilities and continued cash generation from the
synfuel business, cash flows are expected to improve. We will continue to pursue opportunities to
grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion if we can find opportunities that meet our strategic,
financial and risk criteria.

Cash from Financing Activities

We rely on both short-term borrowings and longer-term financings as a source of funding for
our capital requirements not satisfied by the Company’s operations. Short-term borrowings, which
are mostly in the form of commercial paper borrowings, provide us with the liquidity needed on a
daily basis. Our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities.

DTE Energy and its subsidiaries have a total of $1.675 billion in credit facilities, which provide
liquidity to our commercial paper programs and support the use of letters of credit.

Borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing short-term interest rates. The
agreements require each of the Companies to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of no
more than .65 to l and an “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (EBITDA)
to interest ratio of no less than 2 to 1. DTE Energy has significant room under these provisions,
with coverage totaling 4.3 to 1 and leverage at .489 to 1 at December 31, 2004. The Companies are
currently in compliance with these financial covenants. Should either Detroit Edison or MichCon
have delinquent debt obligations of at least $25 million to any creditor, such delinquency will be
considered a default under DTE Energy’s credit agreements. These agreements have standard material
adverse change (MAC) clauses, however, the agreements expiring in October 2009 include a provision
that the MAC clause does not apply when borrowings are made to repay maturing commercial paper.

Additionally, Detroit Edison has a $200 million short-term financing agreement secured by customer
accounts receivable. The agreement contains certain covenants related to the delinquency of
accounts receivable. Detroit Edison is currently in compliance with these covenants.

For additional information see Note 10 — Short-Term Credit Arrangements and Borrowings.



Our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and
maturity. We continually evaluate our leverage target, which is currently 50% or lower, to ensure
it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating. We have
completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our

long-term debt and strengthening our balance sheet. The extension of the average maturity was
accomplished at interest rates that lowered our debt costs.

Net cash used for financing activities improved $727 million in 2004 and declined $1.0 billion in
2003, compared to the prior periods. The 2004 change was primarily due to higher issuances of new
long and short-term debt and fewer repurchases of long-term debt. The 2003 change was due to
higher redemptions of long-term debt and lower proceeds from issuances of new debt and common
stock. For additional information on debt issuances and redemptions, see Note 9 — Long-Term Debt
and Preferred Securities.

Amounts available under shelf registrations include $500 million at DTE Energy and $150 million at
Detroit Edison. MichCon does not have current shelf capacity. In 2005, we plan on filing new
shelf registration statements for MichCon and Detroit Edison.

Common stock issuances or repurchases can also be a source or use of cash. In January 2005, we
announced the DTE Energy Board has authorized the repurchase of up to $700 million in common stock
through 2008. The authorization provides Company management with flexibility to pursue share
repurchases from time to time, and will depend on future cash flows and investment opportunities.
In January 2005, we discontinued issuing new DTE Energy shares for our dividend reinvestment plan,
which generated approximately $50 million annually. We also contributed $170 million of DTE Energy
common stock to our pension plan in the first quarter of 2004.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework
for comparing the credit quality of securities and not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities. Management believes that the current credit ratings of the Company provide
sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets
not specifically related to DTE



Energy may affect the Company’s ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase
in the return required by investors.

In November 2004, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings downgraded MichCon. In December 2004,
Standard & Poor’s downgraded DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon. The ratings reflect weaker
credit metrics due to decreased cash flows mainly stemming from increased operation and maintenance
costs without sufficient regulatory relief. Additional unfavorable changes in our ratings could
restrict our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing
costs.

We have issued guarantees for the benefit of various non-utility subsidiaries. In the event that
our credit rating is downgraded to below investment grade, certain of these guarantees would
require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately $356 million at December 31,
2004. Additionally, our trading business could be required to restrict operations and our access to
the short-term commercial paper market could be restricted or eliminated. While we currently do
not anticipate such a downgrade, we cannot predict the outcome of current or future reviews. The
following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally respected credit rating
agencies. All ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related
securities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

There are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements that require
considerable judgment. Such estimates relate to regulation, risk management and trading activities,
Section 29 tax credits, goodwill, pension and postretirement costs, the allowance for doubtful
accounts, and legal and tax reserves.

Regulation

A significant portion of our business is subject to regulation. Detroit Edison and MichCon
currently meet the criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71,
“

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation

.” Application of this standard results
in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and
non-regulated businesses. SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities
for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated
businesses. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in
discontinuing the application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of our businesses. If we were to
discontinue the application of SFAS No. 71 on all our operations, we estimate that the
extraordinary loss would be as follows:

* Excludes securitized regulatory assets

Management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of SFAS
No. 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current
rate environment (Note 4).

Risk Management and Trading Activities

All derivatives are recorded
at fair value and shown as “Assets or liabilities from risk
management and trading activities” in the consolidated statement of financial position. Risk
management activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

as amended. Through December 2002, trading activities were
accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) Issue No. 98-10, “

Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities

.”
Effective January 2003, trading activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133. See
Note 2 — New Accounting Pronouncements.

The offsetting entry to “Assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” is to
other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use of the derivative, how it is designated
and if it qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair values of derivative contracts were adjusted
each reporting period for changes using market sources such as:

•

published exchange traded market data

•

prices from external sources

•

price based on valuation models

Market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts. Derivative contracts are
only marked to market to the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective,
transparent prices can be obtained. Unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions
that do not meet this criterion.

Section 29 Tax Credits

We generate Section 29 tax credits from our synfuel, coke battery and biomass operations. We
recognize earnings as tax credits are generated at our facilities in one of two ways. First, to
the extent we generate credits to our own account, we recognize earnings through reduced tax
expense. Second, to the extent we have sold an interest in our synfuel facilities to third
parties, we recognize gains as synfuel is produced and sold, and when there is persuasive evidence
that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.

All Section 29 tax credits taken after 1997 are subject to audit by the IRS, however, all of our
synthetic fuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the IRS with respect
to their operations. Audits of four of our synfuel facilities for the years 2001 and 2002 were
successfully completed during 2004. One synfuel facility is currently under audit. If our Section
29 tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could be a
significant write-off of previously recorded earnings from such tax credits.



Tax credits generated by our facilities were $449 million in 2004, as compared to $387 million in
2003 and $351 million in 2002. The portion of tax credits generated for our own account were $38
million in 2004, as compared to $241 million in 2003 and $250 million in 2002, with the remaining
credits generated allocated to third party partners. Outside firms assist us in assuring we operate
in accordance with our private letter rulings and within the parameters of the law, as well as
calculating the value of tax credits.

Goodwill

Certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations
(Notes 2 and 16). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

” each of
our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever
events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired. In order to perform
these impairment tests, we must determine the reporting unit’s fair value using valuation
techniques, which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting
unit. These cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and
significant judgment by management regarding future performance. To the extent estimated cash
flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of
its goodwill, which would adversely impact our earnings.

As of December 31, 2004, our goodwill totaled $2.1 billion. The majority of our goodwill is
allocated to our utility reporting units, with approximately $772 million allocated to the utility
Energy Gas reporting unit. The value of the utility reporting units is significantly impacted by
rate orders and the regulatory environment. The utility Energy Gas reporting unit is comprised
primarily of MichCon. We have made certain cash flow assumptions for MichCon that are dependent
upon the successful outcome of the outstanding gas rate case (Note 4). These assumptions may
change when we receive a final rate order, which is expected during the first quarter of 2005.

Based on our 2004 goodwill impairment test, we determined that the fair value of our reporting
units exceed their carrying value and no impairment existed. We will continue to monitor
regulatory events, and evaluate their impact on our valuation assumptions and the carrying value of
the related goodwill. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ
from our projections.

Pension and Postretirement Costs

Our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of
factors, including rates of return on plan assets, the discount rate, the rate of increase in
health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions.

We had pension costs for qualified pension plans of $81 million in 2004, $47 million in 2003, and
pension income of $9 million in 2002. Postretirement benefits costs for all plans were $125 million
in 2004, $118 million in 2003, and $70 million in 2002. Pension and postretirement benefits costs
for 2004 is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected
long-term rate of return on our plan assets of 9.0%. In developing our expected long-term rate of
return assumption, we evaluated input from our consultants, including their review of asset class
risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions. Projected returns are based on broad
equity and bond markets. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset
allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 65% in equity markets, 28% in fixed
income markets, and 7% invested in other assets. Because of market volatility, we periodically
review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate. Given market
conditions, we believe 9.0% is a reasonable long-term rate of return on our plan assets. We will
continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of return, at least
annually.

We base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a market-related
valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation
recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a three-year period. Because of this
method, the future value of assets



will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. We have unrecognized net
gains due to the recent favorable performance of the financial markets. As of December
31, 2004, we had $63 million of cumulative gains that remain to be recognized in the
calculation of the market-related value of assets.

The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit
obligations is based on a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a
recognized rating agency. The discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 6.25% at
December 31, 2003 to 6.0% at December 31, 2004. Due to recent financial market performance, lower
discount rates and increased health care trend rates, we estimate that our 2005 pension costs will
approximate $96 million compared to $81 million in 2004 and our 2005 postretirement benefit costs
will approximate $155 million compared to $125 million in 2004. In the last several years we have
made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact
of higher costs. Future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future
investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan
design. Additionally, future pension costs for Detroit Edison will be affected by a pension
tracking mechanism, which was authorized by the MPSC in its November 2004 rate order. The tracking
mechanism provides for the recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below the amount
reflected in Detroit Edison’s base rates.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets by 1.0% would have increased our
2004 qualified pension costs by approximately $24 million. Lowering the discount rate and the
salary increase assumptions by 1.0% would have increased our pension costs for 2004 by
approximately $8 million. Lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by 1.0% would have
decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2004 by approximately $17
million.

The market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by the
financial markets. The value of our plan assets increased from $2.4 billion at December 31, 2002 to
$2.9 billion at December 31, 2003. The value at December 31, 2004 increased to $3.3 billion. The
investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize an additional
minimum pension liability, an intangible asset and an entry to other comprehensive loss
(shareholders’ equity) at December 2002, 2003 and 2004. The additional minimum pension liability
and related accounting entries will be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair
value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations. The recording of the
minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow.

Pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years
without substantial returns in the financial markets. We made a $35 million cash contribution to
the pension plan in 2002, a $222 million cash contribution in 2003 and a $170 million contribution
to our pension plan in the form of DTE Energy common stock in 2004. We also contributed $33
million to the postretirement plans in 2002 and contributed $80 million to the postretirement plans
in 2004. We did not contribute to the postretirement plans in 2003. We do not anticipate making a
contribution to our qualified pension plans in 2005. At the discretion of management, we
anticipate making a $0 to $40 million contribution to our postretirement plans in 2005.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act was signed into
law. This Act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that
provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law. The
effects of the subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement benefit costs reduced
costs by $16 million in 2004.

See Note 14 – Retirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets for a further discussion of our pension and
postretirement benefit plans.



Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk
of specific customers, historical trends, economic conditions, age of receivables and other
information. Higher customer bills due to increased gas prices, the lack of adequate levels of
assistance for low-income customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase
in past due receivables. As a result of these factors, our allowance for doubtful accounts
increased in 2003 and 2004. We believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable
estimates. However, failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables
would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow.

Legal and Tax Reserves

We are involved in legal and
tax proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course
of business. We regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in
connection with asserted or potential matters, and establish reserves
when appropriate. Legal reserves are based upon management’s
assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings against the
Company. Tax reserves are based upon management’s assessment of
potential adjustments to tax positions taken. We regularly review
ongoing tax audits and prior audit experience, in addition to current
tax and accounting authority in assessing potential adjustments.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Protecting the environment, as well as correcting past environmental damage, continues to be a
focus of state and federal regulators. Legislation and/or rulemaking could further impact the
electric utility industry including Detroit Edison. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality have aggressive programs to clean-up contaminated
property.

Air

- The EPA ozone transport and acid rain regulations and final new air quality standards
relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will continue to impact us. Detroit Edison has
spent approximately $580 million through December 2004 and estimates that it will spend up to $100
million in 2005. Detroit Edison estimates it will incur from $700 million to $1.3 billion of
additional future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy both existing
and proposed new control requirements. Recovery of costs to be incurred through December 2004 was
provided for in our November 2004 electric rate order. See Note 4 –Regulatory Matters.

The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing
violations of the Clean Air Act, asserting that older, coal-fired power plants have been modified
in ways that would require them to comply with the more restrictive “new source” provisions of the
Clean Air Act. Detroit Edison received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this
subject. The EPA has not initiated proceedings against Detroit Edison. The United States District
Court for the Southern District of Ohio Eastern Division issued a decision in August 2003 finding
Ohio Edison Company in violation of the new source provisions of the Clean Air Act. If the Court’s
decision is upheld, the electric utility industry could be required to invest substantial amounts
on pollution control equipment. During the same month, however, a district court in a different
division rendered a conflicting decision on the matter. On October 27, 2003, the EPA promulgated
new rules, effective December 26, 2003, allowing repair, replacement or upgrade of production
equipment without triggering source requirement controls if the cost of the parts and repairs do
not exceed 20% of the replacement value of the equipment being upgraded. Such repairs will be
considered routine maintenance, however any changes in emissions would be subject to existing
pollution permit limits and other state and federal programs for pollutants. Several states and
environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and, on December 24, 2003, were
granted a stay until the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit hears the arguments on the case. We
cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon Detroit Edison.

Water

- In July 2004, the EPA published final regulations establishing performance standards for
reducing fish loss at existing power plant cooling water intake structures. These regulations
require individual facility studies, and possible intake modifications that will be determined and
implemented



over the next five to seven years. It is estimated that we will incur up to $50 million in
additional capital expenditures for Detroit Edison.

Contaminated Sites

- DTE Enterprises Inc. (MichCon and Citizens) owns, or previously owned, 18
former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites. During the mid-1980’s, Enterprises conducted preliminary
environmental investigations at former MGP sites, and some contamination related to the by-products
of gas manufacturing was discovered at each site. Enterprises employed outside consultants to
evaluate remediation alternatives and associated costs for these sites. As a result of these
studies, Enterprises accrued a liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of $24 million. At
December 31, 2004, the reserve balance was $24 million of which $4.5 million was classified as
current. Our current estimates indicate that the previously accrued amounts are adequate to cover
the costs of required remedial actions.

Detroit Edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites, including two former MGP
sites, the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank
locations. The findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate
these sites is approximately $8 million, which is expected to be incurred over the next several
years. As a result of the investigation, Detroit Edison accrued approximately $8 million liability
during 2004.

DTE ENERGY OPERATING SYSTEM AND DTE2

During 2002, we adopted the DTE Energy Operating System, which is the application of tools and
operating practices that have resulted in operating efficiencies, inventory reductions and
improvements in technology systems, among other enhancements. Operation and maintenance expenses
benefited from our Company-wide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies and enhance operating
performance. We expect continued cost containment efforts and process improvements.

In 2003, we began the implementation of DTE2, a Company-wide initiative to improve existing
processes and to implement new core information systems including, finance, human resources, supply
chain and work management. We expect to incrementally spend approximately $150 million to $175
million over the life of the project. We expect the benefits to outweigh this investment primarily
from lower costs, faster business cycles, repeatable and optimized processes, enhanced internal
controls, improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs.

We are in process of launching the first phase of our multi-year DTE2 project. Although our
implementation plan includes detailed testing and contingency arrangements to ensure a smooth and
successful transition, we can provide no assurance that complications will not arise that could
interrupt our operations.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 2– New Accounting Pronouncements for discussion of new pronouncements .

FAIR VALUE OF CONTRACTS

The following disclosures are voluntary and we believe provide enhanced transparency of the
derivative activities and position of our Energy Trading & Marketing segment and our other
businesses.

We use the criteria in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

“Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

as amended and interpreted, to determine if certain
contracts must be accounted for as derivative instruments. The rules for determining whether a
contract meets the criteria for derivative accounting are numerous and complex. Moreover,
significant judgment is required to determine whether a contract requires derivative accounting,
and similar contracts can sometimes be accounted for differently. If a contract is accounted for
as a derivative instrument, it is recorded in the



financial statements as Assets or Liabilities from Risk Management and Trading Activity, at the
fair value of the contract. The recorded fair value of the contract is then adjusted quarterly to
reflect any change in the fair value of the contract, a practice known as mark-to-market (MTM)
accounting.

Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms-length
transaction. To determine the fair value of contracts that are accounted for as derivative
instruments, we use a combination of quoted market prices and mathematical valuation models.
Valuation models require various inputs, including forward prices, volatility, interest rates, and
exercise periods.

Contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments are power and gas forwards, futures,
options and swaps, as well as foreign currency contracts. Items we do not generally account for as
derivatives (and which are therefore excluded from the following tables) include gas inventory, gas
storage and transportation arrangements, full-requirements power contracts and gas and oil
reserves. As subsequently discussed, we have fully reserved the value of derivative contracts
beyond the liquid trading timeframe and which therefore do not impact income.

The subsequent tables contain the following four categories represented by their operating
characteristics and key risks.

•

“Proprietary Trading” represents derivative activity transacted
with the intent of taking a view, capturing market price changes,
or putting capital at risk. This activity is speculative in
nature as opposed to hedging an existing exposure.

•

“Structured Contracts” represents derivative activity transacted
with the intent to capture profits by originating substantially
hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers, utilities,
retail aggregators and alternative energy suppliers. Although
transactions are generally executed with a buyer and seller
simultaneously, some positions remain open until a suitable
offsetting transaction can be executed.

•

“Economic Hedges” represents derivative activity associated with
assets owned and contracted by DTE Energy, including forward sales
of gas production and trades associated with owned transportation
and storage capacity. Changes in the value of derivatives in this
category economically offset changes in the value of underlying
non-derivative positions, which do not qualify for fair value
accounting. The difference in accounting treatment of derivatives
in this category and the underlying non-derivative positions can
result in significant earnings volatility as discussed in more
detail in the preceding Results of Operations section.

•

“Gas Production” represents derivative activity associated with
our Michigan gas reserves. A substantial portion of the price
risk associated with these reserves has been mitigated through
2013. Changes in the value of the hedges are recorded as
Liabilities from Risk Management and Trading with an offset in
other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are
deemed effective. The amounts shown in the following tables
exclude the value of the underlying gas reserves and the changes
therein.

Maturity of Fair Value of MTM Energy Contract Net Assets

As previously discussed, we fully reserve all unrealized gains and losses related to periods
beyond the liquid trading timeframe. Our intent is to recognize MTM activity only when pricing
data is obtained from active quotes and published indexes. Actively quoted and published indexes
include exchange traded (i.e., NYMEX) and over-the-counter (OTC) positions for which broker quotes
are available. The NYMEX has currently quoted prices for the next 72 months. Although broker
quotes for gas and power are generally available for 18 and 24 months into the future, respectively, we fully reserve all
unrealized gains and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading timeframe and which
therefore do not impact income.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Commodity Price Risk

DTE Energy has commodity price risk arising from market price fluctuations in conjunction with
the anticipated purchase of electricity to meet its obligations during periods of peak demand. We
also are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations on gas sale and purchase contracts, gas
production and gas inventories. To limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations, we have
entered into a series of electricity and gas futures, forwards, option and swap contracts.
Commodity price risk associated with our electric and gas utilities is limited due to the PSCR and
GCR mechanisms (Note 1).

Our Energy Services and Biomass businesses are also subject to crude oil price risk. As previously
discussed, the Section 29 tax credits generated by DTE Energy’s synfuel and biomass operations are
subject to phase out if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels.

See Note 12 – Financial and Other Derivative Instruments for further discussion.

Credit Risk

Bankruptcies

We purchase and sell electricity, gas, coal, coke and other energy products from and to numerous
companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy, retail and other industries. A number of
customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We
have negotiated or are currently involved in negotiations with each of the companies, or their
successor companies, that have filed for bankruptcy protection. We regularly review contingent
matters relating to purchase and sale contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at
risk of probable loss. We believe our accrued amounts are adequate for probable losses. The final
resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements
in the period they are resolved.

We engage in business with customers that are non-investment grade. We closely monitor the credit
ratings of these customers and, when deemed necessary, we request collateral or guarantees from
such customers to secure their obligations.



Energy Trading & CoEnergy Portfolio

We utilize both external and internally generated credit assessments when determining the credit
quality of our trading counterparties. The following table displays the credit quality of our
trading counterparties as of December 31, 2004:

This category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment
grade. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented less
than 2% of the total gross credit exposure.

(3)

This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody’s or Standard &
Poor’s, but are considered investment grade based on DTE Energy’s evaluation of the
counterparty’s creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this
category represented 9% of the total gross credit exposure.

(4)

This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody’s or Standard &
Poor’s, and are considered non-investment grade based on DTE Energy’s evaluation of the
counterparty’s creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this
category represented less than 1% of the gross credit exposure.

Interest Rate Risk

DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and
preferred securities. In order to manage interest costs, we use treasury locks and interest rate
swap agreements. Our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury
rates, commercial paper rates and London Inter-Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). As of December 31, 2004,
the Company has a floating rate debt to total debt ratio of approximately 11% (excluding
securitized debt).

Foreign Currency Risk

DTE Energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations
associated with fixed priced contracts. These contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and
are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for long-term transportation capacity.
To limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, we have entered into a series of currency
forward contracts through 2008.

Summary of Sensitivity Analysis

We performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate the fair values of our commodity contracts,
long-term debt instruments and foreign currency forward contracts. The sensitivity analysis
involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at December 31, 2004 by a hypothetical 10% and
calculating the resulting change in the fair values of the commodity, debt and foreign currency
agreements.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls and Procedures

See
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for
management’s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures,
its report on internal control over financial reporting, and its
conclusion on changes in internal control over financial reporting.

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

Management of the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of DTE Energy’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2004, which is the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that such controls and procedures are effectively designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control system was designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that control may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December
31, 2004, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those
criteria.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting has been audited by the Company’s independent auditors, as stated in their report which
is included herein.

(c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting

The Company has established a formal assessment process and related procedures to evaluate the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting using criteria specified by COSO. The
assessment process is comprehensive in scope, utilizes internal and external resources and involves
many individuals at various levels of the Company in the design, testing and evaluation of internal
control.

As part of the evaluation and assessment process, the Company has been improving the design and
operating effectiveness of many entity-level and process-level controls. Control testing and
remediation activities provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that a material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting will be avoided. The inherent limitations of our current
internal controls, a portion of
which are manual by their nature, contribute to the potential for
control deficiencies. Management does not believe any areas requiring
further improvement constitute a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth
quarter of 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, that DTE Energy Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.



Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2004
and for the year then ended, and the financial statement schedule;
and our report dated March 15,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company:

We have audited the consolidated statement of financial position of DTE Energy Company and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of DTE Energy Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements of the Company taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with the required
adoption of certain new accounting principles, in 2003 the Company changed its method of accounting
for asset retirement obligations, energy trading contracts and gas inventories and in 2002 the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and energy trading contracts.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated March 15, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

DTE Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE
1 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate Structure

DTE Energy is an exempt holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
and owns the following businesses:

•

The Detroit Edison Company (Detroit Edison), an electric utility engaged in the
generation, purchase, distribution and sale of electric energy to 2.1 million customers in
southeast Michigan;

•

Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon), a natural gas utility engaged in the
purchase, storage, transmission and distribution and sale of natural gas to 1.2 million
customers throughout Michigan; and

•

Other non-utility subsidiaries engaged in energy marketing and trading, energy services
and various other electricity, coal and gas related businesses.

Detroit Edison and MichCon are regulated by the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). The
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates certain activities of Detroit Edison’s
business as well as various other aspects of businesses under DTE Energy. In addition, we are
regulated by other federal and state regulatory agencies including the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others.

Segments realigned

– Through 2004, we operated our businesses through three strategic business
units (Energy Resources, Energy Distribution and Energy Gas). Each business unit had utility and
non-utility operations. The balance of our business consisted of Corporate & Other. See Note 16
for further discussion. In 2005, we expect to realign our business units to strengthen the
Company’s focus on customer relationships and growth within our non-utility businesses. Based on
this structure, we will set strategic goals, allocate resources and evaluate performance.
Beginning with the first quarter of 2005, we expect to report our segment information based on the
following realignment:

•

Electric Utility

, consisting of Detroit Edison;

•

Gas Utility

, primarily consisting of MichCon;

•

Non-utility Operations

•

Power and Industrial Projects

, primarily consisting of synfuel projects, on-site
energy services, steel-related projects, power generation with services, and waste coal
recovery operations;

•

Unconventional Gas Production,

primarily consisting of gas production and coal bed
methane operations;

•

Fuel Transportation and Marketing

, primarily consisting of coal transportation and
marketing, gas pipelines and storage, and energy marketing and trading operations; and

•

Corporate & Other

, primarily consisting of corporate support functions and certain
energy technology investments.

References in this report to “we,” “us,” “our” or “Company” are to DTE Energy and its subsidiaries,
collectively.

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in which we have
controlling influence. Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method
when the company is able to influence the operating policies of the investee. Non-majority owned
investments include investments



in limited liability companies, partnerships or joint ventures.
When we do not influence the operating policies of an investee, the cost method is used. We
eliminate all intercompany balances and transactions.

For entities that are considered variable interest entities, we apply the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 46-R,

“Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.”

For a detailed discussion of FIN 46-R, see
Note 2 – New Accounting Pronouncements.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to use
estimates and assumptions that impact reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from
our estimates.

Prior to December 2004, DTE Energy did not eliminate amounts, principally within Other Income and
Other Deductions, resulting from certain intercompany transactions. The amounts of the
transactions are immaterial and had no effect on net income. Previously reported prior period
amounts have been adjusted to eliminate those intercompany transactions and are now consistent with
the current year’s presentation. We reclassified certain other prior year balances to match the current year’s financial statement presentation.

Revenues

Revenues from the sale and delivery of electricity, and the sale, delivery and storage of
natural gas are recognized as services are provided. Detroit Edison and MichCon record revenues for
electric and gas provided but unbilled at the end of each month.

Detroit Edison’s accrued revenues include a component for the cost of power sold that is
recoverable through the Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR) mechanism. MichCon’s accrued revenues
include a component for the cost of gas sold that is recoverable through the Gas Cost Recovery
(GCR) mechanism. Annual PSCR and GCR proceedings before the MPSC permit Detroit Edison and
MichCon to recover prudent and reasonable supply costs. Any overcollection or undercollection of
costs, including interest, will be reflected in future rates. Prior to 2004, Detroit Edison’s
retail rates were frozen under Public Act (PA) 141. See Note 4 for further discussion.
Accordingly, Detroit Edison did not accrue revenues under the PSCR mechanism prior to 2004.

Non-utility businesses recognize revenues as services are provided and products are delivered. Our
Energy Marketing & Trading segment records in revenues net unrealized derivative gains and losses
on energy trading contracts, including those to be physically settled.

Gains from Sale of Interests in Synthetic Fuel Facilities

Through December 2004, we have sold majority interests in eight of our nine synthetic fuel
production plants, representing approximately 92% of our total production capacity. Proceeds from
the sales are contingent upon production levels and the value of Section 29 tax credits. Section
29 tax credits are subject to phase out if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels. See
Note 13 for further discussion. We recognize gains from the sale of interests in the synfuel
facilities as synfuel is produced and sold, and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales
proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We have
recorded gains from the sale of interests in synthetic fuel facilities totaling $219 million, $83
million and $40 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Until the gain recognition criteria are met, gains from selling interests in synfuel facilities
will be deferred. It is possible that gains will be deferred in the first, second and/or third
quarters of each year until there is
persuasive evidence that no tax credit phase out will occur for the applicable calendar year. This
could result in shifting earnings from earlier quarters to later quarters of a calendar year.



Comprehensive Income

We comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 130, “

Reporting
Comprehensive Income

,” that established standards for reporting comprehensive income. SFAS No. 130
defines comprehensive income as the change in common shareholders’ equity during a period from
transactions and events from non-owner sources, including net income. As shown in the following
table, amounts recorded to other comprehensive income (OCI) at December 31, 2004 include:
unrealized gains and losses from derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133,
“

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities;

” unrealized gains and losses on
available for sale securities under SFAS No. 115, “

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities;

” and, minimum pension liabilities as prescribed by SFAS No. 87, “

Employers’
Accounting for Pensions.”

Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and temporary investments with
remaining maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash consists of funds held to satisfy
requirements of certain debt and partnership operating agreements. Restricted cash is classified as
a current asset as all restricted cash is designated for interest and principal payments due within
one year.

Inventories

We value fuel inventory and materials and supplies at average cost.

Gas inventory at MichCon is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. At December 31,
2004, the replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the $89 million LIFO cost by $330
million. At December 31, 2003, the replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the $117
million LIFO cost by $251 million. During 2004, MichCon
liquidated 5.7 billion cubic feet of prior years’ LIFO layers.
The liquidation benefited 2004 cost of gas by approximately
$7 million, but had no impact on earnings as a result of the GCR
mechanism.

Our Energy Marketing & Trading segment uses the average cost method for its gas in inventory.

Property is stated at cost and includes construction-related labor, materials, overheads and
an “allowance for funds used during construction” (AFUDC). The cost of properties retired, less
salvage, at Detroit Edison and MichCon are charged to accumulated depreciation.



Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred, except for Fermi 2.
Approximately $3.8 million of expenses related to the anticipated Fermi 2 refueling outage
scheduled for 2006 were accrued at December 31, 2004. Amounts are being accrued on a pro-rata basis over an 18-month period that began in
November 2004. We have utilized the accrue-in-advance policy for nuclear refueling outage costs
since the Fermi 2 plant was placed in service in 1988. This method also matches the regulatory
recovery of these costs in rates set by the MPSC.

We base depreciation provisions for utility property at Detroit Edison and MichCon on straight-line
and units of production rates approved by the MPSC. The composite depreciation rate for Detroit
Edison was 3.4% in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The composite depreciation rate for MichCon was 3.6%,
3.5%, and 3.6% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The average estimated useful life for each class of utility property, plant and equipment as of
December 31, 2004 follows:

Estimated Useful Lives
in Years

Utility

Generation

Distribution

—

N/A



Non-utility property is depreciated over its estimated useful life using straight-line,
declining-balance or units-of-production methods.

We credit depreciation, depletion and amortization expense when we establish regulatory assets for
stranded costs related to the electric Customer Choice program and deferred environmental
expenditures.

Gas Production

We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for investments in gas properties.
Under this method of accounting, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and
development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has
found proved reserves. If an exploratory well has not found proved reserves, the costs of drilling
the well are expensed. The costs of development wells are capitalized, whether productive or
nonproductive. Geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying
and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred. An impairment loss is recorded to the
extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties, on a property-by-property basis, are
considered not to be realizable. An impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of
proved gas properties exceed the aggregate related undiscounted future net revenues. Depreciation,
depletion and amortization of proved gas properties are determined using the units-of-production
method.

Long-Lived Assets

Our long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds the expected future cash flows generated by the asset, an impairment loss is
recognized resulting in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Intangible Assets, Including Software Costs

Our intangible assets consist primarily of software. We capitalize the costs associated with
computer software we develop or obtain for use in our business. We amortize intangible assets on a
straight-line basis over
expected periods of benefit. Intangible assets amortization expense was $43 million in 2004, $40
million in 2003 and $46 million in 2002. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of
intangible assets at December 31, 2004 were $445 million and $151 million, respectively. The gross
carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets at December 31, 2003 were $537
million and $303 million,



respectively. Amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to
be $40 million annually for 2005 through 2009.

Excise and Sales Taxes

We record the billing of excise and sales taxes as receivable with an offsetting payable to
the applicable taxing authority, with no impact on the consolidated statement of operations.

Deferred Debt Costs

The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the life
of each debt issue. In accordance with MPSC regulations applicable to our electric and gas
utilities, the unamortized discount, premium and expense related to debt redeemed with a
refinancing are amortized over the life of the replacement issue. Discount, premium and expense on
early redemptions of debt associated with non-utility operations are charged to earnings.

Insured and Uninsured Risks

We have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of
risks. Our insurance policies cover risk of loss from various events, including property damage,
general liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability and directors’ and officers’ liability.

Under our risk management policy, we self-insure portions of certain risks up to specified limits,
depending on the type of exposure. We periodically review our insurance coverage. During 2003, we
reviewed our process for estimating and recognizing reserves for self-insured risks. As a result
of this review, we revised the process for estimating liabilities under our self-insured layers to
include an actuarially determined estimate of “incurred but not reported” (IBNR) claims. We have
an actuarially determined estimate of our IBNR liability prepared annually and adjust the related
reserve as appropriate.

Stock-Based Compensation

We have a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described in Note 15. The plan
permits the awarding of various stock awards, including options, restricted stock and performance
shares. We account for stock awards under the plan under the recognition and measurement
principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

.” No compensation cost related to stock options is reflected in earnings, as all options
granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date
of grant. The recognition provisions under SFAS No. 123, “

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,”
require the recording of compensation expense for stock options equal to their fair value at date
of grant as determined using an option pricing model. The following table illustrates the effect
on net income and earnings per share if we had recorded compensation expense for options granted
under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

We generally classify investments in debt and equity securities as either trading or
available-for-sale and have recorded such investments at market value with unrealized gains or
losses included in earnings or in other comprehensive income or loss, respectively. Changes in the
fair value of nuclear decommissioning-related investments are recorded as adjustments to regulatory
assets or liabilities (Note 5).

Investment in Plug Power

In 1997, we invested in Plug Power Inc., a company that designs and develops on-site electric
fuel cell power generation systems. Since Plug Power is considered a development stage company,
generally accepted accounting principles required us to record gains and losses from Plug Power
stock issuances as an adjustment to equity. Prior to November 2003, we accounted for our investment
in Plug Power under the equity method of accounting. We did not participate in Plug Power’s
secondary stock offering in November 2003 and as of December 31, 2003 we owned 14.1 million shares
or approximately 19% of Plug Power’s common stock. We have determined that we do not have the
ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial policies of Plug Power.
Accordingly, we began prospective application of the cost method of accounting for our investment
in Plug Power, effective November 2003. We record our investment at market value and account for
unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income or loss. In May 2004, we sold 3.5 million
shares of Plug Power stock and recorded a gain of approximately $14 million, net of taxes. The sale
reduced our ownership interest in Plug Power to 10.6 million shares, or approximately 14%.

NOTE 2 – NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Energy Trading Activities

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98-10, “

Accounting for Contracts Involved in
Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities

,” companies were required to use mark-to-market
accounting for contracts utilized in energy trading activities. EITF Issue No. 98-10 was rescinded
in October 2002, and energy trading contracts must now be reviewed to determine if they meet the
definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133, “

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

.” SFAS No. 133 requires all derivatives to be recognized in the statement of financial
position as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. SFAS No. 133 also requires
that changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge
accounting criteria are met. Energy trading contracts not meeting the definition of a derivative
are accounted for under settlement accounting, effective October 25, 2002 for new contracts and
effective January 1, 2003 for existing contracts. Derivative contracts are only marked to market to
the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective, transparent prices can be
obtained. Unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions that do not meet this
criteria.

Additionally, inventory utilized in energy trading activities accounted for under the fair value
method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43 is no longer
permitted. Our Energy Marketing & Trading segment uses gas inventory in its trading operations and
switched from the fair value method to the average cost method in January 2003.

Effective January 1, 2003, we no longer applied EITF Issue No. 98-10 to energy contracts and ARB
No. 43 to gas inventory. As a result of discontinuing the application of these accounting
principles, we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change that reduced net income for the
first quarter of 2003 by $16 million (net of taxes of $9 million).



Asset Retirement Obligations

On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, “

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,

”
which requires the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in
which it is incurred. We identified a legal retirement obligation for the decommissioning costs for
our Fermi 1 and 2 nuclear plants. To a lesser extent, we have retirement obligations for our
synthetic fuel operations, gas production facilities, asphalt plant, gas gathering facilities and
various other operations. As to utility operations, we believe that adoption of SFAS No. 143
results primarily in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset retirement costs that we
are currently recovering in rates and are deferring such differences under SFAS No. 71, “

Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation

.”

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, we recorded a plant asset of $306 million
with offsetting accumulated depreciation of $106 million, a retirement obligation liability of $815
million and reversed previously recognized obligations of $377 million, principally nuclear
decommissioning liabilities. We also recorded a cumulative effect amount related to utility
operations as a regulatory asset of $221 million, and a cumulative effect charge against earnings
of $11 million (net of tax of $7 million) for 2003.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation
is incurred, such as assets with an indeterminate life, the liability is to be recognized when a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Generally, distribution assets have an
indeterminate life, retirement cash flows cannot be determined and there is a low probability of
retirement, therefore no liability has been recorded for these assets.

The pro forma effect on earnings had SFAS No. 143 been adopted for all periods presented would
decrease reported net income and basic and diluted earnings per share as follows:

$


A significant portion of the asset retirement obligations represents nuclear decommissioning
liabilities, which are funded through a surcharge to electric customers over the life of the Fermi
2 nuclear plant.

SFAS No. 143 also requires the quantification of the estimated cost of removal obligations, arising
from other than legal obligations, which have been accrued through depreciation charges. At
December 31, 2003, we reclassified approximately $655 million of previously accrued asset removal
costs related to our utility operations, which had been previously netted against accumulated
depreciation to regulatory liabilities. There is a generic case before the MPSC to determine the
accounting and regulatory treatment of removal costs for Michigan utilities.



Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

In January 2003, FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51,”

was issued and requires
an investor with a majority of the variable interests (primary beneficiary) in a variable interest
entity to consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the entity. A variable
interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have controlling interests, the
equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity’s activities without receiving
additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or equity investors do not share
proportionally in gains or losses.

In October 2003 and December 2003, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FIN 46-6 and FIN 46-Revised
(FIN 46-R), respectively, which clarified and replaced FIN 46 and also provided for the deferral of
the effective date of FIN 46 for certain variable interest entities. We have evaluated all of our
equity and non-equity interests and have adopted all current provisions of FIN 46-R. The adoption
of FIN 46-R did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Medicare Act Accounting

In December 2003, the “

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003”

(Medicare Act) was signed into law. The Medicare Act provides for a non-taxable federal subsidy to
sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least “actuarially
equivalent” to the benefit established by law. We elected at that time to defer the provisions of
the Medicare Act, and its impact on our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net
periodic postretirement benefit cost, pending the issuance of specific authoritative accounting
guidance by the FASB.

In May 2004, FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 106-2 was issued on accounting for the effects of the
Medicare Act. The guidance in this FSP is applicable to sponsors of single-employer defined benefit
postretirement health care plans for which (a) the employer has concluded the prescription drug
benefits available under the plan to some or all participants are “actuarially equivalent” to
Medicare Part D and thus qualify for the subsidy under the Medicare Act and (b) the expected
subsidy will offset or reduce the employer’s share of the cost of the underlying postretirement
prescription drug coverage on which the subsidy is based. We believe we qualify for the subsidy
under the Medicare Act and the expected subsidy will partially offset our share of the cost of
postretirement prescription drug coverage.

In June 2004, we adopted FSP No. 106-2, retroactive to January 1, 2004. As a result of the
adoption, our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related to benefits
attributed to past service was reduced by approximately $95 million and was accounted for as an
actuarial gain. The effects of the subsidy reduced net postretirement costs by $16 million in 2004.

Stock Based Payments

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123-R, “

Stock Based Payments,

” which establishes
the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges equity instruments for goods or
services. Application of SFAS No. 123-R is required for interim or annual periods beginning after
June 15, 2005 with earlier adoption encouraged. We have completed a preliminary review and
estimate that the new standard will reduce reported earnings by approximately $5 million to $10
million per year.

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, we
adopted SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,”

which addresses the financial accounting and reporting
standards for the acquisition of intangible assets outside of a
business combination and for goodwill and other intangible assets
subsequent to their acquisition. This accounting standard requires
that goodwill no longer be amortized, but reviewed at least annually
for impairment. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we discontinued the
amortization of goodwill effective January 1, 2002.

NOTE 3 – DISPOSITIONS

International Transmission Company – Discontinued Operation

In February 2003, we sold International Transmission Company (ITC), our electric transmission
business, for $610 million to affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Trimaran Capital
Partners, LLC. The sale



generated a preliminary net of tax gain of $63 million in 2003. The gain was net of transaction
costs, the portion of the gain that was refundable to customers and the write off of approximately
$44 million of allocated goodwill. The gain was lowered to $58 million in 2004 under the MPSC’s
November 2004 final rate order that resulted in a revision of the applicable transaction costs and
customer refund.

As prescribed by SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

” we
have reported the operations of ITC as a discontinued operation as shown in the following table:

Detroit Edison’s Steam Heating Business

In January 2003, we sold Detroit Edison’s steam heating business to Thermal Ventures II, LP.
Due to the continuing involvement of Detroit Edison in the steam heating business, including the
commitment to purchase steam and/or electricity through 2024, fund certain capital improvements and
guarantee the buyer’s credit facility, we recorded a net of tax loss of approximately $14 million
in 2003. As a result of Detroit Edison’s continuing involvement, this transaction is not
considered a sale for accounting purposes. The steam heating business had assets of $6 million at
December 31, 2002, and had net losses of $12 million in 2002. See Note 13 – Commitments and
Contingencies.

Southern Missouri Gas Company – Discontinued Operation

We own Southern Missouri Gas Company (SMGC), a public utility engaged in the distribution,
transmission and sale of natural gas in southern Missouri. In the first quarter of 2004, management
approved the marketing of SMGC for sale. As of March 31, 2004, SMGC met the SFAS No. 144 criteria
of an asset “held for sale,” and we have reported its operating results as a discontinued
operation. We recognized a net of tax impairment loss of approximately $7 million in 2004,
representing the write-down to fair value of the assets of SMGC, less costs to sell, and the
write-off of allocated goodwill. In November 2004, we entered into a definitive agreement providing
for the sale of SMGC. Following receipt of regulatory approvals and resolution of other
contingencies, it is anticipated that the transaction will close in 2005. SMGC had assets of $9
million and liabilities of $35 million at December 31, 2004.

NOTE 4 – REGULATORY MATTERS

Regulation

Detroit Edison and MichCon are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which
issues orders pertaining to retail rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of
generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting and
operating-related matters. Detroit Edison is also regulated by the FERC with respect to financing
authorization and wholesale electric activities.

As subsequently discussed in the “Electric Industry Restructuring” section, Detroit Edison’s rates
were frozen through 2003 and capped for small business customers through 2004 and for residential
customers through 2005 as a result of Public Act (PA) 141. However, Detroit Edison was allowed to
defer certain costs to be



recovered once rates could be increased, including costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes,
laws and other governmental actions.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

Detroit Edison and MichCon apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71,

“Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation,”

to their regulated operations. SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of
regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue
and expense in non-regulated businesses. Continued applicability of SFAS No. 71 requires that rates
be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and be charged to and
collected from customers. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment
could result in the Company discontinuing the application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of its
utility businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any regulatory asset or
liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management believes that
currently available facts support the continued application of SFAS No. 71 to Detroit Edison and
MichCon.

ASSETS

•

Securitized regulatory assets

— The net book balance of the
Fermi 2 nuclear plant was written off in 1998 and an
equivalent regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the
Fermi 2 regulatory asset and certain other regulatory assets
were securitized pursuant to PA 142 and an MPSC order. A
non-bypassable securitization bond surcharge recovers the
securitized regulatory asset over a fourteen-year period
ending in 2015.



LIABILITIES



Electric Rate Case

Rate Request

- In June 2003, Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC requesting a
change in retail electric rates, resumption of the PSCR mechanism, and recovery of net stranded
costs. The application and subsequent revisions resulted in a request to increase base rates by
$583 million annually.

In addition, Detroit Edison requested recovery of certain regulatory assets. As subsequently
discussed, Detroit Edison received interim and final rate orders relating to its June 2003 rate
application.

Represents estimated amounts to be incurred in 2005, as well as carrying costs on unrecovered
balances, that were authorized for recovery by the MPSC. Actual amounts incurred are subject
to review in future MPSC proceedings, and any overcollections or undercollections will be
reflected in future rates.

MPSC Interim Rate Order

- On February 20, 2004, the MPSC issued an order for interim rate
relief. The order authorized an interim increase in base rates, a transition charge for customers
participating in the electric Customer Choice program and a new PSCR factor.

The interim base rate increase totaled $248 million annually, effective February 21, 2004, and was
applicable to all customers not subject to a rate cap. The increase was allocated to both
full-service customers ($240 million) and electric Customer Choice customers ($8 million). However,
because of the rate caps under PA 141, not all of the increase was realized in 2004. The interim
order also terminated certain transition credits and authorized transition charges to electric
Customer Choice customers designed to result in $30 million in additional revenues. Additionally,
the MPSC authorized a reduced PSCR factor for all customers, designed to lower revenues by $126
million annually. However, the MPSC order allowed Detroit Edison to increase base rates for
customers still subject to the cap in an equal and offsetting amount with the required reduction in
the PSCR factor to maintain the total capped rate levels currently in effect for these customers.

The MPSC deferred addressing other items in the rate request, including a surcharge to recover
regulatory assets, until a final rate order was issued.



MPSC Final Rate Order

- On November 23, 2004, the MPSC issued an order for final rate relief. The
MPSC determined that the base rate increase granted to Detroit Edison should be $336 million
annually effective November 24, 2004 and is applicable to all customers not subject to the rate
cap. The final order provides for the future recovery of losses resulting from electric Customer
Choice. Additionally, beginning in 2005, the final order allows Detroit Edison to recover the
discounts previously provided to special manufacturing contract (SMC) customers of $38 million,
resulting in an overall base rate increase of $374 million annually. As subsequently discussed,
Detroit Edison has been deferring certain costs as regulatory assets that it believes are
recoverable under PA 141 once rate caps expire. The final order addressed numerous issues relating
to regulatory assets, including the amounts recoverable and the recovery mechanism. The final
order authorized the recovery of a lower level of stranded costs than had been recorded through
February 20, 2004, the date of the interim order. Accordingly, Detroit Edison adjusted its net
stranded costs related regulatory asset, which decreased 2004 net income by $21 million.

The MPSC’s final order authorizes the recovery of approximately $385 million of regulatory assets
through three mechanisms:

•

The first mechanism recovers certain
accrued regulatory assets over a
five-year period using a regulatory
asset recovery surcharge (RARS) and is
collectible from all full service
customers as their rate caps expire. The
total amount to be collected is
estimated to be $240 million, plus
carrying costs of 9.74% on unrecovered
balances. The recoverable regulatory
assets include costs associated with
Clean Air Act compliance, deferred
Midwest Independent System Operator
(MISO) transmission fees, and deferred
excess capital expenditures. The MPSC
also authorized the refunding of over
collected 1997 storm costs.

•

The second mechanism includes a
surcharge to recover electric Customer
Choice implementation costs of $101
million and is collectible from both
full service and electric Customer
Choice customers. This charge will not
be implemented until all current rate
caps expire in 2006 and will include
carrying costs of 7% on unrecovered
balances.

•

The third mechanism includes a surcharge
to recover $44 million in historical
stranded costs incurred in 2002, 2003
and January and February 2004 and is
collectible from electric Customer
Choice customers, including carrying
costs of 7% on unrecovered balances.

Other significant items authorized by the MPSC in its final order:



implement a tracking mechanism for retiree health care costs (Other
Postemployment Benefits Costs Tracker).

•

Detroit Edison was ordered to file a rate unbundling
and restructuring case by March 23, 2005. As
subsequently discussed, this rate restructuring
proposal was filed on February 4, 2005.

•

Changes to the existing electric Customer Choice
program regarding customers returning to full utility
service. Customers electing to participate in the
electric Customer Choice program will not be
permitted to return to Detroit Edison’s full service
rates for two years. Electric Customer Choice
customers returning to full service must remain on
bundled rates for at least one year following their
return. Customers who fail to give the appropriate
notice or do not stay on the electric Customer Choice
program for two years are required to pay the higher
of the applicable tariff energy price plus 10%, or
the market price of power plus 10%, for any power
taken from Detroit Edison.

In December 2004, Detroit Edison and other parties filed petitions for rehearing relating to the
MPSC’s November 2004 final rate order. Among other items, Detroit Edison’s petition requests a
correction of the capital structure used in determination of the final order and recovery of
certain disallowed costs. Detroit Edison awaits an MPSC decision on
the petitions for rehearing.

Electric Rate Restructuring Proposal

On February 4, 2005, Detroit Edison filed a rate restructuring proposal with the MPSC to
restructure its electric rates and begin phasing out subsidies that are part of its current pricing
structure. The proposal would adjust rates for each customer class to be reflective of the full
costs incurred to service such customers. Under the proposal, commercial and industrial rates
would be lowered, but residential rates would increase over a five-year period beginning in 2007.
The MPSC anticipates that this proceeding will be completed in time to have new rates in effect no
later than January 1, 2006.

Other Postemployment Benefits Costs Tracker

On February 10, 2005, Detroit Edison filed an application requesting MPSC approval of a
proposed tracking mechanism for retiree health care costs. The application was filed as required
pursuant to the MPSC’s November 2004 order.

Electric Industry Restructuring

Electric Rates, Customer Choice and Stranded Costs

– In 2000, the Michigan Legislature enacted
PA 141 that reduced electric retail rates by 5%, as a result of savings derived from the issuance
of securitization bonds. The legislation also contained provisions freezing rates through 2003 and
preventing rate increases (i.e., rate caps) for small business customers through 2004 and for
residential customers through 2005. The price freeze period expired on February 20, 2004 pursuant
to an MPSC order. In addition, PA 141 codified the MPSC’s existing electric Customer Choice program
and provided Detroit Edison with the right to recover net stranded costs associated with Customer
Choice. Detroit Edison was also allowed to defer certain costs to be recovered once rates could be
increased, including costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes, laws and other governmental
actions.

As required by PA 141, the MPSC conducted a proceeding to develop a methodology for calculating net
stranded costs associated with electric Customer Choice. In a December 2001 order, the MPSC
determined that Detroit Edison could recover net stranded costs associated with the fixed cost
component of its electric generation operations. Specifically, there would be an annual proceeding
or true-up before the MPSC reconciling the receipt of revenues associated with the fixed cost
component of its generation services to the revenue requirement for the fixed cost component of
those services, inclusive of an allowance for the cost of capital. Any resulting shortfall in

recovery, net of mitigation, would be considered a net stranded cost. The MPSC authorized Detroit
Edison to establish a regulatory asset to defer recovery of its incurred stranded costs, subject to
review in a subsequent annual net stranded cost proceeding.



In July 2003, the MPSC issued an order finding that Detroit Edison had no net stranded costs in
2000 and 2001. Detroit Edison filed a petition for rehearing of the July 2003 order, which the
MPSC denied in December 2003. Detroit Edison has appealed. As previously discussed, the MPSC’s
November 2004 final order authorized recovery of $44 million of historical stranded costs incurred
in 2002, 2003 and January and February 2004 collectible from electric Customer Choice customers
through transition charges. Since March 1, 2004, Detroit Edison has recorded $108 million of
additional stranded costs as a regulatory asset as the result of rate caps and higher electric
Customer Choice sales losses than included in the 2004 MPSC interim order.

Securitization

– Detroit Edison formed The Detroit Edison Securitization Funding LLC
(Securitization LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary, for the purpose of securitizing its qualified
costs, primarily related to the unamortized investment in the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant. In March
2001, the Securitization LLC issued $1.75 billion of securitization bonds, and Detroit Edison sold
$1.75 billion of qualified costs to the Securitization LLC. The Securitization LLC is independent
of Detroit Edison, as is its ownership of the qualified costs. Due to principles of consolidation,
the qualified costs and securitization bonds appear on the company’s consolidated statement of
financial position. The Company makes no claim to these assets. Ownership of such assets has
vested in the Securitization LLC and been assigned to the trustee for the securitization bonds.
Neither the qualified costs nor funds from an MPSC approved non-bypassable surcharge collected from
Detroit Edison’s customers for the payment of costs related to the Securitization LLC and
securitization bonds are available to Detroit Edison’s creditors.

Excess Securitization
Savings

– In January 2004, the MPSC issued an order directing Detroit Edison
to file a report by March 15, 2004, of the accounting of the savings due to securitization and the
application of those savings through December 2003. In addition, Detroit Edison was requested to
include in the report an estimate of the foregone carrying cost associated with the excess
securitization savings. A report was filed on February 16, 2004 in compliance with the MPSC order.

DTE2 Accounting Application

In 2003, we began the implementation of DTE2, a Company-wide initiative to improve existing
processes and to implement new core information systems, including finance, human resources, supply
chain and work management. The new information systems are replacing systems that are approaching
the end of their useful lives. We expect the benefits of DTE2 to include lower costs, faster
business cycles, repeatable and optimized processes, enhanced internal controls, improvements in
inventory management and reductions in system support costs.

In July 2004, Detroit Edison filed an accounting application with the MPSC requesting authority to
capitalize and amortize DTE2 costs, consisting of computer equipment, software and development
costs, as well as related training, maintenance and overhead costs. Through December 2004, we have
expensed approximately $20 million of training, maintenance and overhead costs pending MPSC action
on our application. Detroit Edison is proposing a 15-year amortization period for the costs,
exclusive of the computer equipment costs.

Power Supply Cost Recovery Proceedings

2004 Plan Year

– An MPSC December 2003 order resumed the PSCR mechanism that had been
suspended while rates were frozen. The order authorized a new PSCR factor for all customers
effective January 1, 2004. The MPSC’s February 2004 interim order provided for a credit of 1.05
mills per kWh compared to a 2.04 mills per kWh charge previously in effect. Detroit Edison will
file a 2004 PSCR reconciliation case by March 31, 2005.

2005 Plan Year

– In September 2004, Detroit Edison filed its 2005 PSCR plan case seeking approval
of a levelized PSCR factor of 1.82 mills per kWh above the amount included in base rates. In
December 2004, Detroit Edison filed revisions to its 2005 PSCR plan case in accordance with the
November 2004 MPSC rate order. The revised filing seeks approval of a levelized PSCR factor of up
to 0.48 mills per kWh above the new base rates established in the final electric rate order.
Included in the factor are power supply costs, transmission expenses and NOx emission allowance
costs. Detroit Edison self-implemented a factor of a



negative 2.00 mills per kWh on January 1, 2005. The Michigan Attorney General has filed a motion
for summary disposition of this proceeding based on arguments that the PSCR statute requires a
fixed 48-month PSCR factor. We cannot predict the nature or timing of actions the MPSC will take
on this motion.

Transmission Proceedings

On November 18, 2004, a FERC order approved a transmission pricing structure to facilitate
seamless trading of electricity between MISO and the PJM Interconnection. The pricing structure
eliminates layers of transmission charges between the two regional transmission organizations. The
FERC noted that the new pricing structure may result in transmission owners facing abrupt revenue
shifts. To facilitate the transition to the new pricing structure, the FERC authorized a Seams
Elimination Cost Adjustment (SECA), effective from December 2004 through March 2006. Under MISO’s
filing with the FERC, Detroit Edison’s SECA obligation would be $2.2 million per month from
December 2004 through March 2005. Detroit Edison has estimated that the SECA charge for the April
2005 through March 2006 period will be approximately $1 million per month. On December 20, 2004,
Detroit Edison filed a request for rehearing with the FERC which states, among other things, that
SECA is retroactive ratemaking and is unlawful under the Federal Power Act. Under the MPSC’s
November 2004 final rate order, transmission expenses are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism.
Therefore, SECA charges, if ultimately imposed, should not have a financial impact to Detroit
Edison.

Gas Rate Case

Rate Request –

In September 2003, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for an increase
in service and distribution charges (base rates) for its gas sales and transportation customers.
The filing requests an overall increase in base rates of $194 million per year (approximately 7%
increase, inclusive of gas costs), beginning January 1, 2005. MichCon requested that the MPSC
increase base rates by $154 million per year on an interim basis by April 1, 2004.

MPSC Interim Rate Order

– In September 2004, the MPSC issued an order granting interim rate relief
to MichCon in the amount of $35 million. The interim rate order was based on a 50% debt and 50%
equity capital structure, and an 11.5% rate of return on common equity. Amounts collected are
subject to a potential refund pending a final order in this rate case.

MPSC Staff Recommendation on Final Rate Relief –

The Staff has recommended a $76 million increase
in base rates compared to MichCon’s requested base rate relief of $194 million. The Staff also
supports a provision, proposed by MichCon, that would allow MichCon to recover or refund 90% of
uncollectible accounts receivable expense above or below the amount that is reflected in base
rates. In addition, the Staff proposed a 50% debt and 50% equity capital structure utilizing a
reduced rate of return on common equity of 11%. MichCon’s current allowed rate of return on common
equity is 11.5%.

MPSC Proposal for Decision (PFD) –

The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a PFD on MichCon’s
rate request on December 10, 2004. The PFD recommends an increase in base rates of $60 million. The
PFD supports the Staff’s recommendations for capital structure, rate of return on common equity and
for the proposed reconciliation of uncollectible accounts receivable. MichCon expects a final order
in the first quarter of 2005.

Gas Industry Restructuring

In December 2001, the MPSC approved MichCon’s application for a voluntary, expanded permanent
gas Customer Choice program, which replaced the experimental program that expired in March 2002.
The number of customers eligible to participate in the gas Customer Choice program increased over a
three-year period. Effective April 2004, all of MichCon’s 1.2 million customers could elect to
participate in the Customer Choice program, thereby purchasing their gas from suppliers other than
MichCon. The MPSC also approved the use of deferred accounting for the recovery of implementation
costs of the gas Customer Choice program. As of December 2004, approximately 111,000 customers are
participating in the gas Customer Choice program.



Gas Cost Recovery Proceedings

2002 Plan Year

- In December 2001, the MPSC issued an order that permitted MichCon to
implement GCR factors up to $3.62 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) for January 2002 billings and up to
$4.38 per Mcf for the remainder of 2002. The order also allowed MichCon to recognize a regulatory
asset of approximately $14 million representing the difference between the $4.38 factor and the
$3.62 factor for volumes that were unbilled at December 31, 2001. The regulatory asset is subject
to the 2002 GCR reconciliation process. In March 2003, the MPSC issued an order in MichCon’s 2002
GCR plan case. The MPSC ordered MichCon to reduce its gas cost recovery expenses by $26.5 million
for purposes of calculating the 2002 GCR factor due to MichCon’s decision to utilize storage gas
during 2001 that resulted in a gas inventory decrement for the 2001 calendar year.

Although we recorded a $26.5 million reserve in 2003 to reflect the impact of this order, a final
determination of actual 2002 revenue and expenses including any disallowances or adjustment, will
be decided in MichCon’s 2002 GCR reconciliation case that was filed with the MPSC in February 2003.
The Staff and various intervening parties in this proceeding are seeking to have the MPSC disallow
an additional $26 million, representing unbilled revenues at December 2001. One party has also
proposed the disallowance of half of an $8 million payment made to settle Enron bankruptcy issues.
The other parties to the case have recommended that the Enron bankruptcy settlement be addressed in
the 2003 GCR reconciliation case. An MPSC Administrative Law Judge has recommended disallowances of
$26.5 million related to the use of storage gas in 2001 and $26 million related to the December
2001 unbilled issue, and recommended that the $8 million related to the Enron issue be addressed in
the 2003 GCR reconciliation case. We have included this item in our testimony in the 2003 GCR
reconciliation filed in February 2004. The Staff has recommended that MichCon be allowed to recover
the entire $8 million related to the Enron issue. A final order in this proceeding is expected in
2005. In addition, we filed an appeal of the March 2003 MPSC order with the Michigan Court of
Appeals. In November 2004, the Michigan Court of Appeals denied the appeal.

2003 Plan Year –

In July 2003, the MPSC approved an increase in MichCon’s 2003 GCR rate to a
maximum of $5.75 per Mcf for the billing months of August 2003 through December 2003. MichCon’s
2003 GCR reconciliation case was filed with the MPSC in February 2004. In November 2004, the ALJ
issued a PFD in the 2003 reconciliation case. The ALJ recommended that MichCon recover the full $8
million related to the Enron issue since MichCon had reason to believe at that time that
cancellation of the contract was in the best interests of customers and since customers ultimately
realized a benefit from the cancellation. The ALJ agreed with the MPSC Staff that a $2 million
accounting adjustment related to exchange gas be disallowed.

2004 Plan Year –

In September 2003, MichCon filed its 2004 GCR plan case proposing a maximum GCR
factor of $5.36 per Mcf. MichCon agreed to switch from a calendar year to an operational year as a
condition of its settlement in the 2003 GCR plan case. The operational GCR year would run from
April to March of the following year. To accomplish the switch, the 2004 GCR plan case reflects a
15-month transitional period, January 2004 through March 2005. Under the transition proposal,
MichCon would file two reconciliations pertaining to the transition period; one addressing the
January 2004 to March 2004 period, the other addressing the remaining April 2004 to March 2005
period. The plan also proposes a quarterly GCR ceiling price adjustment mechanism. This mechanism
allows MichCon to increase the maximum GCR factor to compensate for increases in market prices,
thereby reducing the possibility of a GCR under-recovery. Due to the sustained increase in market
prices for natural gas, in June 2004 the MPSC approved a temporary increase in the maximum GCR
factor and a contingent factor which resulted in a new temporary maximum factor of $6.62 per Mcf,
effective from July 1, 2004 until the MPSC issues its final order in this case. As of December 31,
2004, MichCon has accrued a $55 million regulatory asset representing the under-recovery of actual
gas costs incurred in 2004, and the 2003 and 2002 GCR under-recovery.

2005-2006 Plan Year –

In December 2004, MichCon filed its 2005-2006 GCR plan case proposing a
maximum GCR factor of $7.99 per Mcf. The plan includes a quarterly GCR ceiling price adjustment
mechanism. This mechanism allows MichCon to increase the maximum GCR factor to compensate for
increases in market prices, thereby reducing the possibility of a GCR under-recovery.



Minimum Pension Liability

In December 2002, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability as required under SFAS
No. 87, with offsetting amounts to an intangible asset and other comprehensive income. During
2003, the MPSC Staff provided an opinion that the MPSC’s traditional rate setting process allowed
for the recovery of pension costs as measured by SFAS No. 87. Based on the MPSC Staff opinion,
management believes that it will be allowed to recover in rates the minimum pension liability
associated with its utility operations. In 2004 and 2003, we reclassified approximately $605
million ($393 million net of tax) and $585 million ($380 million net of tax), respectively, of
other comprehensive loss associated with the minimum pension liability to a regulatory asset (Note
14).

Other

We are unable to predict the outcome of the regulatory matters discussed herein. Resolution
of these matters is dependent upon future MPSC orders, which may materially impact the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.

NOTE 5 – NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

General

Fermi 2, our nuclear generating plant, began commercial operation in 1988. Fermi 2 has a
design electrical rating (net) of 1,150 megawatts. This plant represents approximately 10% of
Detroit Edison’s summer net rated capability. The net book balance of the Fermi 2 plant was
written off at December 31, 1998, and an equivalent regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the
Fermi 2 regulatory asset was securitized. See Note 4 – Regulatory Matters. Detroit Edison also
owns Fermi 1, a nuclear plant that was shut down in 1972 and is currently being decommissioned. The
NRC has jurisdiction over the licensing and operation of Fermi 2 and the decommissioning of Fermi
1.

Property Insurance

Detroit Edison maintains several different types of property insurance policies specifically
for the Fermi 2 plant. These policies cover such items as replacement power and property damage.
The Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) is the primary supplier of these insurance polices.

Detroit Edison maintains a policy for extra expenses, including replacement power costs
necessitated by Fermi 2’s unavailability due to an insured event. These policies have a 12-week
waiting period and provide an aggregate $490 million of coverage over a three-year period.

Detroit Edison has $500 million in primary coverage and $2.25 billion of excess coverage for
stabilization, decontamination, debris removal, repair and/or replacement of property and
decommissioning. The combined coverage limit for total property damage is $2.75 billion.

For multiple terrorism losses caused by acts of terrorism not covered under the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Act (TRIA) of 2002 occurring within one year after the first loss from terrorism, the
NEIL policies would make available to all insured entities up to $3.2 billion, plus any amounts
recovered from reinsurance, government indemnity, or other sources to cover losses.

Under the NEIL policies, Detroit Edison could be liable for maximum assessments of up to
approximately $28 million per event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear plant
in the United States should exceed the accumulated funds available to NEIL.



Public Liability Insurance

As required by federal law, Detroit Edison maintains $300 million of public liability
insurance for a nuclear incident. For liabilities arising from a terrorist act outside the scope
of TRIA, the policy is subject to one industry aggregate limit of $300 million. Further, under the
Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 (Act), deferred premium charges up to $101 million could be
levied against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $10 million per year per facility.
Thus, deferred premium charges could be levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities
in the event of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities. The Act expired on August 1, 2002.
During 2003, the U.S. Congress extended the Act for commercial nuclear facilities through December
31, 2003. However, provisions of the Act remain in effect for existing commercial reactors.
Legislation to extend the Act in conjunction with comprehensive energy legislation is currently
under debate in Congress. We cannot predict whether Congress will pass the legislation.

Decommissioning

The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and requires
decommissioning funding based upon a formula. The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of
decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of external trust funds to finance
the decommissioning of Fermi 2. Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of
decommissioning costs of Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is continuing to fund FERC jurisdictional amounts
for decommissioning even though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates. We believe the
MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning using the
NRC formula.

Detroit Edison has established a restricted external trust to hold funds collected from customers
for decommissioning and the disposal of low-level radioactive waste. Detroit Edison collected $38
million in 2004, $36 million in 2003 and $42 million in 2002 from customers for decommissioning and
low-level radioactive waste disposal. Net unrealized investment gains of $17 million and $62
million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $39 million in losses in 2002, were recorded as
adjustments to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and regulatory assets. At December 31, 2004,
investments in the external trust consisted of approximately 55% in publicly traded equity
securities, 43% in fixed debt instruments and 2% in cash equivalents.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Detroit Edison had external decommissioning trust funds of $546
million and $474 million, respectively, for the future decommissioning of Fermi 2. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, Detroit Edison had an additional $18 million and $22 million in trust funds for the
decommissioning of Fermi 1. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Detroit Edison also had an external
decommissioning trust fund for low-level radioactive waste disposal costs of $26 million and $22
million, respectively. It is estimated that the cost of decommissioning Fermi 2, when its license
expires in 2025, will be $1.0 billion in 2004 dollars and $3.4 billion in 2025 dollars, using a 6%
inflation rate. In 2001, the company began the decommissioning of Fermi 1, with the goal of
removing the radioactive material and terminating the Fermi 1 license. The decommissioning of
Fermi 1 is expected to be complete by 2009.

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 143, Detroit Edison recorded a retirement obligation liability for
the decommissioning of Fermi 1 and 2 and reversed previously recognized decommissioning
liabilities. At December 31, 2004, we have recorded a liability for the removal of the non-nuclear
portion of the plants of $77 million.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Detroit Edison has a contract
with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel
from Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is obligated to pay the DOE a fee of 1 mill per kWh of Fermi 2
electricity generated and sold. The fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense. Delays have
occurred in the DOE’s program for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent
repository. Until the DOE is able to fulfill its obligation under the contract, Detroit Edison is
responsible for the spent nuclear fuel storage. Detroit Edison estimates that existing storage
capacity will be sufficient until 2007. Detroit Edison is a party in the litigation against the



DOE for both past and future costs associated with the DOE’s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel
under the timetable set forth in the Act.



NOTE 6 — JOINTLY OWNED UTILITY PLANT

Internal Revenue Code Section 29 provides a tax credit for qualified fuels produced and sold
by a taxpayer to an unrelated party during the taxable year. Our Section 29 tax credits earned but
not utilized totaled $483 million and are carried forward indefinitely as alternative minimum tax
credits. The majority of our tax credit properties, including all of our synfuel projects, have
received private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that provide assurance as
to the appropriateness of using these credits to offset taxable income, however, these tax credits
are subject to IRS audit and adjustment.

We have a net operating loss carryforward of $203 million that expires in years 2018 through 2020.
We do not believe that a valuation allowance is required, as we expect to utilize the loss
carryforward prior to its expiration.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts in the
financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent
according to the classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities not related to assets or liabilities are classified according to the expected reversal
date of the temporary differences.

The IRS is currently conducting audits of our federal income tax returns for the years 1998
through 2001. In addition, one of our synfuel facilities is under audit by the IRS for 2001.
Audits of four of our synfuel facilities for the years 2001 and 2002 were completed successfully
during 2004. The Company accrues tax and interest related to tax uncertainties that arise due to
actual or potential disagreements with governmental agencies about the tax treatment of specific
items. At December 31, 2004, the Company had accrued approximately $53 million for such
uncertainties. We believe that our accrued tax liabilities are adequate for all years.



NOTE 8 — COMMON STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

Common Stock

In March 2004, we issued 4,344,492 shares of DTE Energy common stock, valued at $170 million.
The common stock was contributed to a defined benefit retirement plan.

Under the DTE Energy Company Long-Term Incentive Plan, we grant non-vested stock awards to key
employees, primarily management. At the time of grant, we record the fair value of the non-vested
awards as unearned compensation, which is reflected as a reduction in common stock. The number of
non-vested stock awards is included in the number of common shares outstanding; however, for
purposes of computing basic earnings per share, non-vested stock awards are excluded.

Shareholders’ Rights Agreement

We have a Shareholders’ Rights Agreement designed to maximize shareholder value should DTE
Energy be acquired. Under certain triggering events, each right entitles the holder to purchase
from DTE Energy one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of
DTE Energy at a price of $90.00, subject to adjustment as provided for in the Shareholders’ Rights
Agreement. The rights expire in October 2007.

Earnings per Share

We report both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes the issuance of potentially
dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and the repurchase of common shares that would
have occurred with proceeds from the assumed issuance. Diluted earnings per share assume the
exercise of stock options, vesting of non-vested stock awards, and the issuance of performance
share awards. A reconciliation of both calculations is presented in the following table:

computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the common shares, thus making these options
anti-dilutive. Common stock to be issued in August 2005 associated
with the equity-linked securities is not included in the computation
of diluted earnings per share as these shares were not dilutive (Note 9).

•

Redeemed $34 million of Detroit Edison 6.875% tax-exempt bonds maturing in 2022.

In the years 2005 – 2009, our long-term debt maturities are $507 million, $680 million, $597
million, $455 million and $ 361 million, respectively.

Remarketable Securities

At December 31, 2004, $175 million of notes of Detroit Edison and MichCon were subject to
periodic remarketings. The $100 million scheduled to remarket in February 2005 was optionally
redeemed by Detroit Edison, and no remarketings will take place in 2005. We direct the
remarketing agents to remarket these securities at the lowest interest rate necessary to produce a
par bid. In the event that a remarketing fails, we would be required to purchase the securities.

Quarterly Income Debt Securities (QUIDS)

Detroit Edison had three series of QUIDS outstanding at December 31, 2004. Detroit Edison
redeemed all of its outstanding QUIDS on March 4, 2005.

Equity-Linked Securities

In June 2002, DTE Energy issued 6.9 million equity security units with gross proceeds from the
issuance of $172.5 million. An equity security unit consists of a stock purchase contract and a
senior note of DTE Energy. Under the stock purchase contracts, we will sell, and equity security
unit holders must buy, shares of DTE Energy common stock in August 2005 for $172.5 million. The
issue price per share and the exact number of common shares to be sold is dependent on the market
value of a share in August 2005. The issue price will be not less than $43.25 or more than $51.90
per common share, with the corresponding number of shares issued of not more than 4.0 million or
less than 3.3 million shares. We are also obligated to pay the security unit holders a quarterly
contract adjustment payment at an annual rate of 4.15% of the stated amount until the purchase
contract settlement date. We recorded the present value of the contract adjustment payments of $26
million in long-term debt with an offsetting reduction in shareholders’ equity. The liability is
reduced as the contract adjustment payments are made.



Each senior note has a stated value of $25, pays an annual interest rate of 4.60% and matures in
August 2007. The senior notes are pledged as collateral to secure the security unit holders’
obligation to purchase DTE Energy common stock under the stock purchase contracts. The security unit holders may satisfy
their obligations under the stock purchase contracts by allowing the senior notes to be remarketed
with proceeds being paid to DTE Energy as consideration for the purchase of stock under the stock
purchase contracts. Alternatively, holders may choose to continue holding the senior notes and use
cash as consideration for the purchase of stock under the stock purchase contracts.

Net proceeds from the equity security unit issuance totaled $167 million. Expenses incurred in
connection with this issuance totaled $5.6 million and were allocated between the senior notes and
the stock purchase contracts. The amount allocated to the senior notes was deferred and will be
recognized as interest expense over the term of the notes. The amount allocated to the stock
purchase contracts was charged to equity.

Trust Preferred-Linked Securities

DTE Energy has interests in various unconsolidated trusts that were formed for the sole
purpose of issuing preferred securities and lending the gross proceeds to us. The sole assets of
the trusts are debt securities of DTE Energy with terms similar to those of the related preferred
securities. Payments we make are used by the trusts to make cash distributions on the preferred
securities it has issued.

We have the right to extend interest payment periods on the debt securities. Should we exercise
this right, we cannot declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or acquire, any of our
capital stock during the deferral period.

DTE Energy has issued certain guarantees with respect to payments on the preferred securities.
These guarantees, when taken together with our obligations under the debt securities and related
indenture, provide full and unconditional guarantees of the trusts’ obligations under the preferred
securities.

Financing costs for these issuances were paid for and deferred by DTE Energy. These costs are
being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the related securities.

Cross Default Provisions

Substantially all of the net utility properties of Detroit Edison and MichCon are subject to
the lien of mortgages. Should Detroit Edison or MichCon fail to timely pay their indebtedness
under these mortgages, such failure will create cross defaults in the indebtedness of DTE Energy
Corporate.

Preferred and Preference
Securities – Authorized and Unissued

At December 31, 2004, DTE Energy had 5 million shares of preferred stock without par value
authorized, with no shares issued. Of such amount, 1.5 million shares are reserved for issuance in
accordance with the Shareholders’ Rights Agreement.

At December 31, 2004, Detroit Edison had approximately 6.75 million shares of preferred stock with
a par value of $100 per share and 30 million shares of preference stock with a par value of $1 per
share authorized, with no shares issued.

At December 31, 2004, MichCon had 7 million shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1 per
share and 4 million shares of preference stock with a par value of $1 per share authorized, with no
shares issued.



NOTE
10 – SHORT-TERM CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS

In May 2004, DTE Energy entered into a $375 million two-year unsecured revolving credit
facility with a group of banks to be utilized for general corporate borrowings. DTE
Energy had approximately $148 million of letters of credit outstanding against this facility at
December 31, 2004. This agreement requires the company to maintain a debt to total capitalization
ratio of no more than .65 to l and an “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization” (EBITDA) to interest ratio of no less than 2 to 1. DTE Energy is currently in
compliance with these financial covenants.

In October 2004, DTE Energy entered into a $525 million, five-year unsecured revolving credit
facility and lowered its existing three-year revolving credit facility from $350 million to $175
million. Detroit Edison and MichCon also entered into similar revolving credit facilities. Detroit
Edison entered into a $206.25 million, five-year facility and lowered its three-year facility from
$137.5 million to $68.75 million. MichCon entered into a $243.75 million, five-year facility and
lowered its three-year facility from $162.5 million to $81.25 million. The five-year facilities
replace the October 2003 364-day facilities, which expired. The three-year revolving credit
facilities expire in October 2006. The five- and three-year credit facilities are with a syndicate
of banks and may be utilized for general corporate borrowings, but primarily are intended to
provide liquidity support for each of the Companies’ commercial paper programs. Borrowings under
the facilities will be available at prevailing short-term interest rates. The agreements require
each of the Companies to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than .65 to l and
an EBITDA to interest ratio of no less than 2 to 1. The Companies are currently in compliance with
these financial covenants. Should either Detroit Edison or MichCon have delinquent debt obligations
of at least $25 million to any creditor, such delinquency will be considered a default under DTE
Energy’s credit agreements.

As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding commercial paper of $402 million and other short-term
borrowings of $1 million.

Detroit Edison also has a $200 million short-term financing agreement secured by customer accounts
receivable. This agreement contains certain covenants related to the delinquency of accounts
receivable. Detroit Edison is currently in compliance with these covenants. We had no balances
outstanding under this financing agreement at December 31, 2004.

The weighted average interest rates for short-term borrowings were 2.4% and 1.9% at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

NOTE
11 – CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES

Lessee

- We lease various assets under capital and operating leases, including coal cars, a
gas storage field, office buildings, a warehouse, computers, vehicles and other equipment. The

NOTE 12 — FINANCIAL AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We comply with SFAS No. 133, “

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,”
as amended by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149. Listed below are important SFAS No. 133 requirements:

•

All derivative instruments must be recognized as assets or
liabilities and measured at fair value, unless they meet the
normal purchases and sales exemption.

•

The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose
of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated as a
hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting.

•

Special accounting is allowed for a derivative instrument
qualifying as a hedge and designated as a hedge for the
variability of cash flow associated with a forecasted transaction.
Gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the hedge is
recorded in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion
is recorded to earnings. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive
income will be reclassified to net



income when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If a cash flow hedge is discontinued
because it is likely the forecasted transaction will not occur, net gains or losses are
immediately recorded to earnings.

•

Special accounting is also allowed for a derivative instrument qualifying as a hedge and
designated as a hedge of the changes in fair value of an existing asset, liability or firm
commitment. Gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded into earnings. An offsetting
loss or gain on the underlying asset, liability or firm commitment is also recorded to
earnings.

Our primary market risk exposure is associated with commodity prices, credit, interest rates and
foreign currency. We have risk management policies to monitor and decrease market risks. We use
derivative instruments to manage some of the exposure. Except for the activities of the Energy
Marketing & Trading segment, we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.
The fair value of all derivatives is shown as “assets or liabilities from risk management and
trading activities” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Commodity Price Risk

Utility Operations

Detroit Edison

- Detroit Edison generates, purchases, distributes and sells electricity. Detroit
Edison uses forward energy, capacity, and futures contracts to manage changes in the price of
electricity and fuel. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges or meet the
normal purchases and sales exemption and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.
There were no commodity price risk cash flow hedges for utility operations at December 31, 2004.

MichCon

- MichCon purchases, stores, transmits and distributes and sells natural gas. MichCon
has fixed-priced contracts for portions of its expected gas supply requirements through 2005.
These contracts are designated and qualify for the normal purchases and sales exemption and are
therefore accounted for under the accrual method.

Commodity price risk associated with our utilities is limited due to the PSCR and GCR mechanisms
(Note 1).

Non-Utility Operations

Energy Marketing & Trading —

Energy Marketing and Trading markets and trades wholesale electricity
and natural gas physical products, trades financial instruments, and provides risk management
services utilizing energy commodity derivative instruments. Forwards, futures, options and swap
agreements are used to manage exposure to the risk of market price and volume fluctuations on its
operations. These derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings,
usually as adjustments to operating revenues or fuel, purchased power and gas expense. This fair
value accounting better aligns financial reporting with the way the business is managed and its
performance measured.

Energy Marketing & Trading experiences earnings volatility as a result of its gas inventory and
other non-derivative assets that do not qualify for fair value accounting under U. S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Although the risks associated with these asset positions are
substantially offset, requirements to fair value the underlying derivatives result in unrealized
gains and losses being recorded to earnings that eventually reverse upon settlement.

Energy Services and Biomass —

Our Energy Services and Biomass businesses generate Section 29 tax
credits. Additionally, through December 2004, Energy Services has sold majority interests in eight
of its nine synthetic fuel production plants. Proceeds from the sales are contingent upon
production levels, the production qualifying for Section 29 tax credits, and the value of such
credits. Section 29 tax credits are subject to phase out if domestic crude oil prices reach
certain levels. See Note 13 for further discussion.

To manage our exposure in 2005 to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce synfuel
sales proceeds, we entered into a series of derivative contracts covering a specified number of
barrels of oil. The



derivatives, coupled with other contracts, economically hedge approximately 65% of our 2005 synfuel
cash flow exposure. The derivative contracts involve purchased and written call options that
provide for net cash settlement at expiration based on the full year 2005 average New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) trading price of oil in relation to the strike price of each option. If
the average NYMEX price of oil in 2005 is less than approximately $56 per barrel, the derivatives
will yield no payment. If the average NYMEX price of oil exceeds approximately $56 per barrel, the
derivatives will yield a payment equal to the excess of the average NYMEX price over $56 per
barrel, multiplied by the number of barrels covered, up to a maximum
price of approximately $68 per
barrel. The agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting and, as a result, changes in the fair
value of the options are recorded currently in earnings. The fair value changes are recorded as
adjustments to the gain from selling interests in synfuel facilities and therefore included in the
“Asset gains and losses, net” line item in the consolidated statement of operations.

Gas Production

- Our Gas Production business is engaged in natural gas exploration, development and
production. We use derivative contracts to manage changes in the price of natural gas. These
derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive
loss will be reclassified to earnings as the related forecasted production affects earnings through
2013. In 2005, we estimate reclassifying $35 million of losses to earnings.

Credit Risk

Our utility and non-utility businesses are exposed to credit risk if customers or
counterparties do not comply with their contractual obligations. We maintain credit policies that
significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential
customers’ and counterparties’ financial condition, credit rating, collateral requirements or other
credit enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees. We use standardized agreements that
allow the netting of positive and negative transactions associated with a single counterparty.

Interest Rate Risk

We use interest rate swaps, treasury locks and other derivatives to hedge the risk associated
with interest rate market volatility. In 2004 and 2000, we entered into a series of interest rate
derivatives to limit our sensitivity to market interest rate risk associated with the issuance of
long-term debt. Such instruments were designated as cash flow hedges. We subsequently issued
long-term debt and terminated these hedges at a cost that is included in other comprehensive loss.
Amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to interest expense as the
related interest affects earnings through 2030. In 2005, we estimate reclassifying $6 million of
losses to earnings.

Foreign Currency Risk

Energy Marketing and Trading has foreign currency forward contracts to hedge fixed Canadian
dollar commitments existing under power purchase and sale contracts and gas transportation
contracts. We entered into these contracts to mitigate any price volatility with respect to
fluctuations of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Certain of these contracts are
designated as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income.
Amounts recorded to other comprehensive income are classified to operating revenues or fuel,
purchased power and gas expense when the related hedged item affects earnings.

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments is determined by using various market data and other
valuation techniques. The table below shows the fair value relative to the carrying value for
long-term debt securities. The carrying value of certain other financial instruments, such as
notes payable, customer deposits and notes receivable approximate fair value and are not shown.

NOTE 13 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Synthetic Fuel Operations

We partially or wholly own nine synthetic fuel production facilities. Synfuel facilities
chemically change coal, including waste and marginal coal, into a synthetic fuel as determined
under applicable IRS rules. Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code provides tax credits for the
production and sale of solid synthetic fuels produced from coal. To qualify for the Section 29 tax
credits, the synthetic fuel must meet three primary conditions: (1) there must be a significant
chemical change in the coal feedstock, (2) the product must be sold to an unaffiliated entity, and
(3) the production facility must have been placed in service before July 1, 1998. In addition to
meeting the qualifying conditions, a taxpayer must have sufficient taxable income to earn the
Section 29 tax credits.

In-Service Date

- During July 2004, several unaffiliated companies announced that they have been
notified that the IRS intends to challenge the placed in service dates for some of their synfuel
facilities. If the IRS ultimately prevails, Section 29 credits claimed by these companies would be
disallowed. The placed in service issue is fact-driven and specific to each facility. The
in-service dates for eight of our nine synfuel plants have been favorably reviewed by the IRS in
conjunction with issuing determination letters and/or recently completed audits. We believe all
nine of our synthetic fuel plants meet the required in-service condition.

Through December 31, 2004, we have generated and recorded approximately $512 million in synfuel tax
credits.

Oil Prices

- To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides Section
29 tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels from alternative sources. This
incentive is not deemed necessary if the price of oil increases and provides a natural market for
these fuels. As such, the tax credit in a given year is reduced if the Reference Price of oil
within that year exceeds a threshold price. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate
of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil, which in recent years has
been $3 — $4 lower than the NYMEX price for light, sweet crude oil. The threshold price at which
the credit begins to be reduced was set in 1980 and is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2004,
we estimate that the threshold price at which the tax credit would have begun to be reduced was
$51.34 and would have been completely phased out if the Reference Price reached $64.45. The
Reference Price of oil is estimated to be $37.61 for 2004. We also estimate that the 2005 average
wellhead price per barrel of oil would have to exceed approximately $52.37 per barrel to begin
phase out and exceed approximately $65.74 per barrel to eliminate the credits. We cannot predict
with any accuracy the future price of a barrel of oil.

Numerous recent events have increased domestic crude oil prices, including terrorism, storm-related
supply disruptions and worldwide demand. If the credit is reduced or eliminated in future years,
our financial statements would be negatively impacted. We continue to evaluate the current
volatility in oil prices and alternatives available to mitigate our exposure to oil prices as part
of our synfuel-related risk management strategy. To manage our exposure to oil prices in 2005, we
entered into oil-related derivative contracts. See Note 12 for further discussion.

Environmental

Air

- The EPA issued ozone transport and acid rain regulations and, in December 2003, proposed
additional emission regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate and mercury air pollution. The
new rules have led to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide,
sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and particulate emissions. To comply with these new controls,
Detroit Edison has spent approximately $580 million through December 2004, and estimates that it
will spend up to $100 million in 2005 and incur from $700 million to $1.3 billion of additional
future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy



both the existing and proposed new control requirements

.

Under the June 2000 Michigan restructuring
legislation, beginning January 1, 2004, annual return of and on this capital expenditure, in excess
of current depreciation levels, could be deferred in ratemaking, until after the expiration of the
rate cap period, presently expected to end on December 31, 2005 upon MPSC authorization. Under PA
141 and the MPSC’s November 2004 final rate order, we believe that prudently incurred capital
expenditures, in excess of current depreciation levels, are recoverable in rates.

Water

- Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts
of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. Based on the results of the
studies to be conducted over the next several years, Detroit Edison may be required to install
additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the intakes. It is estimated that we will
incur up to $50 million over the next five to seven years in additional capital expenditures for
Detroit Edison.

Contaminated Sites

- Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for
heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil.
Enterprises (MichCon and Citizens) owns, or previously owned, 18 such former manufactured gas plant
(MGP) sites. During the mid-1980’s, Enterprises conducted preliminary environmental investigations
at former MGP sites, and some contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing was
discovered at each site. The existence of these sites and the results of the environmental
investigations have been reported to the MDEQ.

Enterprises is remediating eight of the former MGP sites and conducting more extensive
investigations at five other former MGP sites. Enterprises received MDEQ closure of one site, and a
determination that it is not a responsible party for three other sites. Enterprises received
closure from the EPA in 2002 for one site.

In 1984, Enterprises established a $12 million reserve for costs associated with environmental
investigation and remediation activities. During 1993, MichCon received MPSC approval of a cost
deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former MGP
sites in excess of this reserve. Enterprises employed outside consultants to evaluate remediation
alternatives for these sites, to assist in estimating its potential liabilities and to review its
archived insurance policies. As a result of these studies, Enterprises accrued an additional
liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of $35 million during 1995. In early December 2004,
Enterprises retained multiple environmental consultants to estimate the projected cost to remediate
each MGP facility. The results of the evaluation indicated that the MGP reserve should be set at
$24 million.

During 2004, Enterprises spent approximately $2 million investigating and remediating these former
MGP sites. At December 31, 2004, the reserve balance was $24 million of which $4.5 million was
classified as current. Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques,
nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of
remedial action costs for the sites and, therefore, have an effect on the Company’s financial
position and cash flows. However, we anticipate the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism
approved by the MPSC will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on our
results of operations.

Detroit Edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites, including two former MGP
sites, the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank
locations. The findings of these investigations indicated that the cost to remediate these sites is
approximately $8 million, which is expected to be incurred over the next several years. As a
result of the investigation, Detroit Edison accrued an $8 million liability during 2004.

Guarantees

In certain circumstances we enter into contractual guarantees. We may guarantee another
entity’s obligation in the event it fails to perform. We may provide guarantees in certain
indemnification agreements. Finally, we may provide indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of
others. Below are the details of specific material guarantees we currently provide. Our other
guarantees are not individually material and total approximately $40 million at December 31, 2004.



Sale of Interests in Synfuel Facilities

We have provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in
our synfuel facilities. The guarantees cover general commercial, environmental and tax-related
exposure and will survive until 90 days after expiration of all applicable statute of limitations,
or indefinitely, depending on the nature of the guarantee. We estimate that our maximum liability
under these guarantees at December 31, 2004 totals $905 million.

Parent Company Guarantee of Subsidiary Obligations

We have issued guarantees for the benefit of various non-utility subsidiary transactions. In the
event that DTE Energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade, certain of these
guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately $356 million
at December 31, 2004. This estimated amount fluctuates based upon the provisions and maturities of
the underlying agreements.

Personal Property Taxes

Prior to 1999, Detroit Edison, MichCon and other Michigan utilities asserted that Michigan’s
valuation tables result in the substantial overvaluation of utility personal property. Valuation
tables established by the Michigan State Tax Commission (STC) are used to determine the taxable
value of personal property based on the property’s age. In November 1999, the STC approved new
valuation tables that more accurately recognize the value of a utility’s personal property. The
new tables became effective in 2000 and are currently used to calculate property tax expense.
However, several local taxing jurisdictions have taken legal action attempting to prevent the STC
from implementing the new valuation tables and have continued to prepare assessments based on the
superseded tables. The legal actions regarding the appropriateness of the new tables were before
the Michigan Tax Tribunal (MTT) which, in April 2002, issued its decision essentially affirming the
validity of the STC’s new tables. In June 2002, petitioners in the case filed an appeal of the
MTT’s decision with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In January 2004, the Michigan Court of Appeals
upheld the validity of the new tables. With no further appeal by the petitioners available, the MTT
began to schedule utility personal property valuation cases for Prehearing General Calls. Detroit
Edison and MichCon have filed motions and the MTT agreed to place their cases in abeyance pending
the conclusion of settlement negotiations being conducted by State of Michigan Treasury officials.
On February 14, 2005, MTT issued a scheduling order that lifts the prior abeyances in a significant
number of Detroit Edison and MichCon appeals. The scheduling order sets litigation calendars for
these cases extending into mid-2006.

Detroit Edison and MichCon continue to record property tax expense based on the new tables.
Detroit Edison and MichCon will continue through settlement or litigation to seek to apply the new
tables retroactively and to ultimately resolve the pending tax appeals related to 1997 through
1999. This is a solution supported by the STC in the past. To the extent that settlements cannot be
achieved with the jurisdictions, litigation regarding the valuation of utility property will delay
any recoveries by Detroit Edison and MichCon.

Other Commitments

Detroit Edison has an Energy Purchase Agreement to purchase steam and electricity from the
Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Authority (GDRRA). Under the Agreement, Detroit Edison will
purchase steam through 2008 and electricity through June 2024. In 1996, a special charge to income
was recorded that included a reserve for steam purchase commitments in excess of replacement costs
from 1997 through 2008. The reserve for steam purchase commitments is being amortized to fuel,
purchased power and gas expense with non-cash accretion expense being recorded through 2008. We
purchased $42 million of steam and electricity in 2004, $39 million in 2003 and $37 million in
2002. We estimate steam and electric purchase commitments through 2024 will not exceed $472
million. As discussed in Note 3 — Dispositions, in January 2003, we sold the steam heating
business of Detroit Edison to Thermal Ventures II, LP. Due to terms of the sale, Detroit Edison
remains contractually obligated to buy steam from GDRRA until 2008 and recorded an additional



liability of $20 million for future commitments. Also, we have guaranteed bank loans that Thermal
Ventures II, LP may use for capital improvements to the steam heating system.

In 2004, we modified our future purchase commitments under a transportation agreement with an
interstate pipeline company and terminated a related long-term gas exchange (storage) agreement.
Under the gas exchange agreement, we received gas from the customer during the summer injection
period and redelivered the gas during the winter heating season. The agreements were at rates that
were not reflective of current market conditions and had been fair valued under accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. In 2002, the fair value of the transportation agreement
was frozen when it no longer met the definition of a derivative as a result of FERC Order 637. The
fair value amounts were being amortized to income over the life of the related agreements,
representing a net liability of approximately $75 million as of December 31, 2003. As a result of
the contract modification and termination, we recorded an adjustment to the net liability
increasing 2004 earnings by $48 million, net of taxes.

At December 31, 2004, we have entered into numerous long-term purchase commitments relating to a
variety of goods and services required for our business. These agreements primarily consist of
fuel supply commitments and energy trading contracts. We estimate that these commitments will be
approximately $7.3 billion through 2027. We also estimate that 2005 base level capital expenditures
will be $1.1 billion. We have made certain commitments in connection with expected capital
expenditures.

Bankruptcies

We purchase and sell electricity, gas, coal and coke from and to numerous companies operating
in the steel, automotive, energy and retail industries. Several customers have filed for
bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We have negotiated or are
currently involved in negotiations with each of the companies, or their successor companies, that
have filed for bankruptcy protection. We regularly review contingent matters relating to purchase
and sale contracts and record provisions for amounts considered probable of loss. We believe our
previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable losses. The final resolution of these matters
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements in the period they are
resolved.

Other

We are involved in certain legal, regulatory, administrative and environmental proceedings
before various courts, arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning claims arising in
the ordinary course of business. These proceedings include certain contract disputes,
environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and pending
judicial matters. We cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. We regularly
review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss. The
resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or
financial statements in the period they are resolved.

See Note 4 and Note 5 for a discussion of contingencies related to Regulatory Matters and Nuclear
Operations.

NOTE 14 — RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND TRUSTEED ASSETS

Measurement Date

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we changed the date for actuarial measurement of our
obligations for benefit programs from December 31 to November 30. We believe the one-month change
of the measurement date is a preferable change as it allows time for management to plan and execute
its review of the completeness and accuracy of its benefit programs results and to fully reflect
the impact on its financial results. The change did not have a material effect on retained earnings
as of January 1, 2004, and income from continuing operations, net income and related per share
amounts for any interim period in 2004. Accordingly, all amounts reported in the following tables
for balances as of December 31, 2004 are based on a measurement date of November



30, 2004. Amounts reported in tables for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for balances as of
December 31, 2003 are based on a measurement date of December 31, 2003. Amounts reported in tables
for the year ended December 31, 2003 are based on a measurement date of December 31, 2002.

Qualified and Nonqualified Pension Plan Benefits

We have defined benefit retirement plans for eligible represented and nonrepresented
employees. The plans are noncontributory, cover substantially all employees and provide retirement
benefits based on the employees’ years of benefit service, average final compensation and age at
retirement. Certain represented and nonrepresented employees are covered under cash balance
benefits based on annual employer contributions and interest credits. Our policy is to fund pension
costs by contributing the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(ERISA) and additional amounts when we deem appropriate. We do
not anticipate making a contribution to our qualified pension plans in 2005.

We also maintain supplemental nonqualified, noncontributory, retirement benefit plans for selected
management employees. These plans provide for benefits that supplement those provided by DTE
Energy’s other retirement plans.

We employ a consistent formal process in determining the long-term rate of return for various
asset classes. We evaluate input from our consultants, including their review of historic financial
market risks and returns and long-term historic relationships between the asset classes of
equities, fixed income and other assets, consistent with the widely accepted capital market
principle that asset classes with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-term.
Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates, asset class risks and asset class returns
are evaluated and considered before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The
long-term portfolio return is also established employing a consistent formal process, with due
consideration of diversification, active investment management and rebalancing. Peer data is
reviewed to check for reasonableness .

We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities, fixed income and other
investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets consistent with prudent levels
of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses over the long-term. Risk
tolerance is established through consideration of future plan cash flows, plan funded status, and
corporate financial considerations. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of
equity, fixed income and other investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across
U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, growth and value investment styles, and large and small market
capitalizations. Other assets such as private equity and absolute return funds are used judiciously
to enhance long term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Derivatives may be used to
gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to
leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments. Investment risk is
measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic
asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

In December 2002, we recognized an additional minimum pension liability as required under SFAS
No. 87, “

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

.” An additional pension liability may be required when
the



accumulated benefit obligation of the plan exceeds the fair value of plan assets. Under SFAS No.
87, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability, an intangible asset and other
comprehensive loss. In 2003, we reclassified $572 million of other comprehensive loss related to
Detroit Edison’s minimum pension liability to a regulatory asset after the MPSC Staff provided an
opinion that the MPSC’s traditional rate setting process allowed for the recovery of pension costs
as measured by SFAS No. 87. The additional minimum pension liability, regulatory asset, intangible
asset and other comprehensive loss are adjusted in December of each year based on the plans’ funded
status.

We also sponsor defined contribution retirement savings plans. Participation in one of these plans
is available to substantially all represented and nonrepresented employees. We match employee
contributions up to certain predefined limits based upon eligible compensation, the employee’s
contribution rate and, in some cases, years of credited service. The cost of these plans was $28
million in 2004, $26 million in 2003 and $25 million in 2002.

Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for employees who
are eligible for these benefits. Our policy is to fund certain trusts to meet our postretirement
benefit obligations. Separate qualified Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts
exist for represented and nonrepresented employees.

Benefit costs were calculated assuming health care cost trend rates beginning at 9.0% for 2005
and decreasing to 5.0% in 2010 and thereafter for persons under age 65 and decreasing from 8.0% to
5.0% for persons age 65 and over. A one-percentage-point increase in health care cost trend rates
would have increased the total service cost and interest cost components of benefit costs by $20
million and increased the accumulated benefit obligation by $177 million at December 31, 2004. A
one-percentage-point decrease in the health care cost trend rates would have decreased the total
service and interest cost components of benefit costs by $17 million and would have decreased the
accumulated benefit obligation by $157 million at December 31, 2004.

Effective 2005, we amended our postretirement health care plan to provide for some enhancements.
The changes increased our expected 2005 postretirement cost by $6 million.

In December 2003, the Medicare Act was signed into law which provides for a non-taxable
federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at
least “actuarially equivalent” to the benefit established by law. As discussed in Note 2, we
adopted FSP No. 106-2 in 2004, which provides guidance on the accounting for the Medicare Act. As
a result of the adoption, our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related
to benefits attributed to past service was reduced by approximately $95 million at January 1, 2004
and was accounted for as an actuarial gain. The effects of the subsidy reduced net periodic
postretirement benefit costs by $16 million in 2004. The impact of the Medicare Act on the

Grantor Trust

MichCon maintains a Grantor Trust that invests in life insurance contracts and income

Trust, and MichCon can revoke the trust subject to providing the MPSC with prior notification. We
account for our investment at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded to earnings.

NOTE
15 – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The DTE Energy Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant of incentive stock options,
non-qualifying stock options, stock awards, performance shares and performance units. A maximum of
18 million shares of common stock may be issued under the plan. Participants in the plan include
our employees and members of our Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2004, no performance units
have been granted under the plan.

Options

Options are exercisable according to the terms of the individual stock option award agreements

Stock Awards

Stock awards granted under the plan are restricted for varying periods, which are generally
for three years. Participants have all rights of a shareholder with respect to a stock award,
including the right to receive dividends and vote the shares. Prior to vesting in stock awards,
the participant: (i) may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange or otherwise dispose of shares; (ii)
shall not retain custody of the share certificates; and (iii) will deliver to us a stock power with
respect to each stock award.

The stock awards are recorded at cost that approximates fair value on the date of grant. We
account for stock awards as unearned compensation, which is recorded as a reduction to common
stock. The cost is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. Stock award
activity for the years ended December 31 was:

Performance Share Awards

Performance shares awarded under the plan are for a specified number of shares of common stock
that entitles the holder to receive a cash payment, shares of common stock or a combination
thereof. The final value of the award is determined by the achievement of certain performance
objectives. The awards vest at the end of a specified period, usually three years. We account for
performance share awards by accruing compensation expense over the vesting period based on: (i) the
number of shares expected to be paid which is based on the



probable achievement of performance objectives; and (ii) the fair value of the shares. For 2004,
2003 and 2002, we recorded compensation expense totaling $6.1 million, $5.5 million and $3.6
million, respectively.

During the vesting period, the recipient of a performance share award has no shareholder rights.
However, recipients will be paid an amount equal to the dividend equivalent on such shares.
Performance share awards are nontransferable and are subject to risk of forfeiture. As of December
31, 2004, there were 619,044 performance share awards outstanding.

NOTE
16 – SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

We operate our businesses through three strategic business units (Energy Resources, Energy
Distribution and Energy Gas). Each business unit has utility and non-utility operations. The
balance of our business consists of Corporate & Other. Based on this structure, we set strategic
goals, allocate resources and evaluate performance. This results in the following reportable
segments.

Energy Resources

•

Utility — Power Generation

operations include the power
generation services of Detroit Edison, the company’s electric
utility. Electricity is generated from Detroit Edison’s numerous
fossil plants or its nuclear plant and sold throughout
Southeastern Michigan to residential, commercial, industrial and
wholesale customers.

•

Non-utility

•

Energy Services

is comprised of various businesses that develop, acquire and manage
energy-related assets and services. Such projects include coke production, synfuels
production, on-site energy projects and merchant generation facilities.

•

Energy Marketing & Trading

consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading
operations of DTE Energy Trading Company and the natural gas marketing and trading
operations of DTE Enterprises. Energy Marketing & Trading enters into forwards, futures,
swaps and option contracts as part of its trading strategy.

•

Other Non-utility

operations consist primarily of businesses involved in coal services
and landfill gas recovery. Also includes administrative and general expenses not allocated
to other non-utility businesses.

Energy Distribution

•

Utility — Power Distribution

operations include the electric
distribution services of Detroit Edison. Energy Distribution
distributes electricity generated by Energy Resources and
alternative energy suppliers to Detroit Edison’s 2.1 million
residential, commercial and industrial customers.

•

Non-utility

operations include businesses that assemble,
market, distribute and service a broad portfolio of distributed
generation products, provides application engineering, and
monitors and manages system operations.

Energy Gas

•

Utility

operations include gas distribution services provided

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and

Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and
Procedure

See Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for management’s evaluation of
disclosure controls and procedures, its report on internal control
over financial reporting, and its conclusion on changes in internal
control over financial reporting.



Item 9B. Other Information

On March 11, 2005, the Company entered into Change-in-Control Severance Agreements with each
of the following executive officers: Anthony F. Earley, Jr., Gerard M. Anderson, Robert J. Buckler,
Stephen E. Ewing and David E. Meador. The form of Change-in-Control Severance Agreement is filed
as Exhibit 10-56 to this Form 10-K (the “Agreement”). Each of the Agreements is effective as of
March 11, 2005 and replaces previous change in control agreements between the Company and the above
named officers, including the agreement with Mr. Meador effective as of December 28, 2004. The
Agreement is substantially similar to the form of change in control agreements signed by other
officers of the Company, except with respect to the payment multiple. The description set forth
below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of the Agreement filed herewith.
Capitalized terms are defined in the Agreement.

Under each of the Agreements, in the event that the named officer’s employment is terminated
following a Change in Control, either by the Company or, under certain circumstances, the officer’s
volition, and in accordance with all the terms and conditions of the Agreements, the named officer
will be paid a lump sum payment in an amount equal to three times the sum of (A) Base Pay, plus (B)
the greater of (1) the Annual Bonus for the year in which the Change in Control occurs or (2) the
Annual Bonus for the year in which the Termination Date occurs, in either case based on the
assumption that target performance goals for such year would be met and such payments would be made
assuming the named officer was employed for the entire year or until such later date as may be
required to receive such payment.

Additionally, the named officer would also be paid a lump sum payment in an amount equal to (A) the
greater of (1) the Annual Bonus for the year in which the Change in Control occurs or (2) the
Annual Bonus for the year in which the Termination Date occurs, in either case based on the
assumption that target performance goals for such year would be met and such payments would be made
assuming the named officer was employed for the entire year or until such later date as may be
required to receive such payment, (B) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days prior to the named officer’s Termination Date during the calendar year in which the
Termination Date occurs, and the denominator of which is 365.

Additionally, for a period of twenty-four months following the Termination Date, the Company will
continue to provide the named officer with Welfare Benefits substantially similar to those he was
receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Termination Date, or under certain
circumstances, a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the cost of such benefits. The
Agreements also provide for Gross-Up Payments relating to Excise Taxes incurred by the named
officer as a result of severance payments, and include certain noncompetition obligations.
