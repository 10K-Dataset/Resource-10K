Part I

Items 1.
    and 2. Business and Properties

General

In 1995, DTE Energy incorporated in the State of Michigan. Our
    utility operations consist primarily of Detroit Edison and
    MichCon. We also have four non-utility segments that are engaged
    in a variety of energy-related businesses.

Detroit Edison is a Michigan corporation organized in 1903 and
    is a public utility subject to regulation by the MPSC and the
    FERC. Detroit Edison is engaged in the generation, purchase,
    distribution and sale of electricity to approximately
    2.2 million customers in southeastern Michigan.

MichCon is a Michigan corporation organized in 1898 and is a
    public utility subject to regulation by the MPSC. MichCon is
    engaged in the purchase, storage, transmission, distribution and
    sale of natural gas to approximately 1.2 million customers
    throughout Michigan.

Our four non-utility segments are involved in 1) gas
    pipelines and storage; 2) unconventional gas exploration,
    development, and production; 3) power and industrial
    projects and coal transportation and marketing; and
    4) energy marketing and trading operations.

ELECTRIC
    UTILITY

Description

Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison. Our
    generating plants are regulated by numerous federal and state
    governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC,
    the FERC, the NRC, the EPA and the MDEQ. Electricity is
    generated from our several fossil plants, a hydroelectric pumped
    storage plant and a nuclear plant, and is purchased from
    electricity generators, suppliers and wholesalers. The
    electricity we produce and purchase is sold to four major
    classes of customers: residential, commercial, industrial, and
    wholesale, principally throughout southeastern Michigan.

Represents power that is not distributed by Detroit Edison.

Weather, economic factors, competition and electricity prices
    affect sales levels to customers. Our peak load and highest
    total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of
    the year, driven by air conditioning and other cooling-related
    demands. We occasionally experience various types of storms that
    damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in
    power outages. Restoration and other costs associated with
    storm-related power outages can negatively impact earnings. In
    the December 23, 2008 MPSC rate order for Detroit Edison, a
    tracking mechanism was approved that provides for an annual
    reconciliation for restoration costs (storm and non-storm) using
    a base expense level of $110 million per year. Our
    operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers,
    and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a
    material adverse effect on Detroit Edison.

Fuel
    Supply and Purchased Power

Our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is
    supplemented with purchased power. We expect to have an adequate
    supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to
    serve customers. Our generating capability is heavily dependent
    upon the availability of coal. Coal is purchased from various
    sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary
    in both pricing and terms. We expect to obtain the majority of
    our coal requirements through long-term contracts, with the
    balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot
    purchases. We have eight long-term and two short-term contracts
    for a total purchase of approximately 26 million tons of
    low-sulfur western coal to be delivered in 2009 and 2010. We
    also have eight contracts for the purchase of approximately
    6 million tons of Appalachian coal to be delivered from
    2009 through 2011. All of these contracts have fixed prices. We
    have approximately 84% of our 2009 expected coal requirements
    under contract. Given the geographic diversity of supply, we
    believe we can meet our expected generation requirements. We
    lease a fleet of rail cars and have long-term transportation
    contracts with companies to provide rail and vessel services for
    delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities.

Detroit Edison participates in the energy market through MISO.
    We offer our generation in the market on a day-ahead and
    real-time basis and bid for power in the market to serve our
    load. We are a net purchaser of power that supplements our
    generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles.

Properties

Detroit Edison owns generating plants and facilities that are
    located in the State of Michigan. Substantially all of our
    property is subject to the lien of a mortgage.

There are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange
    of electricity between Detroit Edison and electricity providers
    external to our service area. These interconnections are
    generally owned and operated by ITC Transmission and connect to
    neighboring energy companies.

Regulation

Detroit Edison’s business is subject to the regulatory
    jurisdiction of various agencies, including, but not limited to,
    the MPSC, the FERC and the NRC. The MPSC issues orders
    pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the
    costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions
    of service, accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit
    Edison’s MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have
    historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs,
    plus an authorized rate of return on our investments. The FERC
    regulates Detroit Edison with respect to financing authorization
    and wholesale electric activities. The NRC has regulatory
    jurisdiction over all phases of the operation, construction,
    licensing and decommissioning of Detroit Edison’s nuclear
    plant operations. We are subject to the requirements of other
    regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment and
    health.

See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Energy
    Assistance Programs

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and
    the State of Michigan, remain critical to Detroit Edison’s
    ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and
    collections expenses. Detroit Edison’s uncollectible
    accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of
    government-funded assistance its qualifying customers receive.
    We work continuously with the State of Michigan and others to
    determine whether the share of funding allocated to our
    customers is representative of the number of low-income
    individuals in our service territory.

Strategy
    and Competition

We strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation
    in southeast Michigan. We can accomplish this goal by working
    with our customers, communities and regulatory agencies to be a
    reliable, low-cost supplier of electricity. To ensure generation
    reliability, we continue to invest in our generating plants,
    which will improve both plant availability and operating
    efficiencies. We also are making capital investments in areas
    that have a positive impact on reliability and environmental
    compliance with the goal of high customer satisfaction.

Our distribution operations focus on improving reliability,
    restoration time and the quality of customer service. We seek to
    lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies.
    Revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions,
    economic factors, regulatory events and other risk factors as
    discussed in the “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of
    this Report.

The electric Customer Choice program in Michigan allows all of
    our electric customers to purchase their electricity from
    alternative electric suppliers of generation services. Customers
    choosing to purchase power from alternative electric suppliers
    represented approximately 3% of retail sales in 2008, 4% in 2007
    and 6% of



such sales in 2006. Customers participating in the electric
    Customer Choice program consist primarily of industrial and
    commercial customers whose MPSC-authorized full service rates
    exceed their cost of service. MPSC rate orders and recent energy
    legislation enacted by the State of Michigan are phasing out the
    pricing disparity over five years and have placed a
    10 percent cap on the total potential Customer Choice
    related migration, mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of
    electric Customer Choice on our financial performance. Recent
    higher wholesale electric prices have also resulted in many
    former electric Customer Choice customers migrating back to
    Detroit Edison for electric generation service. When market
    conditions are favorable, we sell power into the wholesale
    market, in order to lower costs to full-service customers.

Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is
    primarily from the

on-site

generation of industrial customers and from distributed
    generation applications by industrial and commercial customers.
    We do not expect significant competition for distribution to any
    group of customers in the near term. In 2008, the Michigan
    legislature passed a comprehensive reform package that requires
    Michigan utilities to serve ten percent of their retail sales
    from renewable energy sources by 2015. In December 2008, Detroit
    Edison issued a request for proposal to purchase Michigan-based
    renewable energy credits.

GAS
    UTILITY

Description

Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens.

Revenue is generated by providing the following major classes of
    service: gas sales, end user transportation, intermediate
    transportation, and gas storage.

Gas sales —

Includes the sale and delivery of
    natural gas primarily to residential and small-volume commercial
    and industrial customers.

•

End user transportation —

Gas delivery service
    provided primarily to large-volume commercial and industrial
    customers. Additionally, the service is provided to residential
    customers, and small-volume commercial and industrial customers
    who have elected to participate in our Customer Choice program.
    End user transportation customers purchase natural gas directly
    from producers or brokers and utilize our pipeline network to
    transport the gas to their facilities or homes.

•

Intermediate transportation —

Gas delivery
    service provided to producers, brokers and other gas companies
    that own the natural gas, but are not the ultimate consumers.
    Intermediate transportation customers utilize our gathering and
    high-pressure transmission system to transport the gas to
    storage fields, processing plants, pipeline interconnections or
    other locations.

•

Storage and other —

Includes revenues from gas
    storage, appliance maintenance, facility development and other
    energy-related services.

Our gas sales, end user transportation and intermediate
    transportation volumes, revenues and net income are impacted by
    weather. Given the seasonal nature of our business, revenues and
    net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of
    the calendar year. By the end of the first quarter, the heating
    season is



largely over, and we typically realize substantially reduced
    revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the
    third quarter.

Our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of
    customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not
    have a material adverse effect on our Gas Utility segment.

Natural
    Gas Supply

Our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily send-out
    capacity of 2.8 Bcf, with approximately 68% of the volume
    coming from underground storage for 2008. Peak-use requirements
    are met through utilization of our storage facilities, pipeline
    transportation capacity, and purchased gas supplies. Because of
    our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline
    transportation and storage capacity, we are able to reliably
    meet our supply requirements. We believe natural gas supply and
    pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market
    demands in the foreseeable future.

We purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by
    contracting with producers and marketers, and we maintain a
    diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts. Supplier,
    producing region, quantity, and available transportation
    diversify our natural gas supply base. We obtain our natural gas
    supply from various sources in different geographic areas (Gulf
    Coast, Mid-Continent, Canada and Michigan) under agreements that
    vary in both pricing and terms. Gas supply pricing is generally
    tied to NYMEX and published price indices to approximate current
    market prices.

Properties

We own distribution, transmission and storage properties that
    are located in the State of Michigan. Our distribution system
    includes approximately 19,000 miles of distribution mains,
    approximately 1,181,000 service lines and approximately
    1,324,000 active meters. We own approximately 2,000 miles
    of transmission lines that deliver natural gas to the
    distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with
    the sources of supply and the market areas. We also own four
    carbon dioxide processing facilities.

We own properties relating to four underground natural gas
    storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of
    approximately 132 Bcf. These facilities are important in
    providing reliable and cost-effective service to our customers.
    In addition, we sell storage services to third parties. Most of
    our distribution and transmission property is located on
    property owned by others and used by us through easements,
    permits or licenses. Substantially all of our property is
    subject to the lien of a mortgage.

We are directly connected to interstate pipelines, providing
    access to most of the major natural gas producing regions in the
    Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and Canadian regions.

    construction and will add an additional 10 miles of
    pipeline when completed in early 2009. We lease a portion of our
    pipeline system to the Vector Pipeline Partnership (an
    affiliate) through a capital-lease arrangement. See Note 14
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
    of this Report.



Regulation

We are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which
    issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs,
    including the costs of regulatory assets, conditions of service,
    accounting and operating-related matters. MichCon’s
    MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have historically been
    designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized
    rate of return on our investments. We are subject to the
    requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to
    safety, the environment and health.

See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Energy
    Assistance Program

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and
    the State of Michigan, remain critical to MichCon’s ability
    to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections
    expenses. MichCon’s uncollectible accounts receivable
    expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded
    assistance its qualifying customers receive. We work
    continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine
    whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is
    representative of the number of low-income individuals in our
    service territory.

Strategy
    and Competition

Our strategy is to be the preferred provider of natural gas in
    Michigan. As a result of more efficient furnaces and appliances,
    and customer conservation due to high natural gas prices and
    economic conditions, we expect future sales volumes to decline.
    We continue to provide energy-related services that capitalize
    on our expertise, capabilities and efficient systems. We
    continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving
    operating efficiencies.

Competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural
    gas providers, as well as providers of alternative fuels and
    energy sources. The primary focus of competition for end user
    transportation is cost and reliability. Some large commercial
    and industrial customers have the ability to switch to
    alternative fuel sources such as coal, electricity, oil and
    steam. If these customers were to choose an alternative fuel
    source, they would not have a need for our end-user
    transportation service. In addition, some of these customers
    could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered
    directly from an interstate pipeline. We compete against
    alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and
    reliable service, supported by our storage capacity.

Our extensive transmission pipeline system has enabled us to
    market 400 to 500 Bcf annually for intermediate
    transportation services and storage services for Michigan gas
    producers, marketers, distribution companies and other pipeline
    companies. We operate in a central geographic location with
    connections to major Mid-western interstate pipelines that
    extend throughout the Midwest, eastern United States and eastern
    Canada.

MichCon’s storage capacity is used to store natural gas for
    delivery to MichCon’s customers as well as sold to third
    parties, under a variety of arrangements for periods up to three
    years. Prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are
    generally higher, but more volatile than for longer periods.
    Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and natural
    gas pricing.

NON-UTILITY
    OPERATIONS

Gas
    Midstream

Description

Gas Midstream owns partnership interests in two interstate
    transmission pipelines and two natural gas storage fields. The
    pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by
    long-term, fixed-price revenue contracts. We have a partnership
    interest in Vector Pipeline (Vector), an interstate transmission
    pipeline, which connects Michigan to Chicago and Ontario. We
    also hold partnership interests in Millennium Pipeline Company
    which indirectly connects southern New York State to Upper
    Midwest/Canadian supply, while



providing transportation service into the New York City markets.
    We have storage assets in Michigan capable of storing up to
    87 Bcf in natural gas storage fields located in Southeast
    Michigan. The Washington 10 and 28 storage facilities are high
    deliverability storage fields having bi-directional
    interconnections with Vector Pipeline and MichCon providing our
    customers access to the Chicago, Michigan, other Midwest and
    Ontario market centers.

Our customers include various utilities, pipelines, and
    producers and marketers.

    MichCon provides physical operations, maintenance, and technical
    support for the Washington 28 and Washington 10 storage
    facilities.

Strategy
    and Competition

Our Gas Midstream business expects to continue its steady growth
    plan. The Gas Midstream business focuses on asset development
    opportunities in the Midwest-to-Northeast region to supply
    natural gas to meet growing demand. We expect much of the growth
    in the demand for natural gas in the U.S. to occur within
    the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions. We forecast these
    regions will require incremental pipeline and gas storage
    infrastructure necessary to deliver gas volumes to meet growing
    demand. Vector is an interstate pipeline that is filling a large
    portion of that need, and is complemented by our Michigan
    storage facilities. We will complete the Shelby 2 storage field
    at our Washington 10 storage complex by 2010 with an additional
    3 Bcf of capacity additions. Once completed the combined
    capacity for Washington 10 and Washington 28 will be
    approximately 90 Bcf. Vector Pipeline received FERC
    approval in June 2008 to build an additional compressor station
    in Michigan and to expand the Vector Pipeline by approximately

100 MMcf/d

to 1.3 Bcf/d, with a proposed in-service date of
    November 1, 2009. Gas Midstream has a 26 percent
    ownership interest in Millennium Pipeline which is capable of
    transporting 525,000 dth/d of natural gas across the southern
    tier of New York towards New York City. Millennium was placed
    in-service December 2008. We plan to expand existing assets and
    develop new assets that are typically supported with long-term
    customer commitments.

Unconventional
    Gas Production

Description

Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural
    gas exploration, development and production within the Barnett
    shale in north Texas. In June 2007, we sold our Antrim shale gas
    exploration and production business in the northern lower
    peninsula of Michigan for gross proceeds of $1.262 billion.
    In January 2008, we sold a portion of our Barnett shale
    properties for gross proceeds of approximately
    $260 million. The properties in the 2008 sale include
    75 Bcfe of proved reserves on approximately 11,000 net
    acres in the core area of the Barnett shale.



In 2008, we added proved reserves of 23 Bcfe in the Barnett
    shale resulting in year-end total proved reserves of
    167 Bcfe. The Barnett shale wells yielded 5 Bcfe of
    production in 2008. Barnett shale leasehold acres increased to
    62,395 gross acres (60,435 net of interest of others)
    excluding impairments. We drilled a total of 37 wells in
    the Barnett shale acreage.

Our Barnett Shale gas production requires processing to extract
    natural gas liquids. Therefore, our wells are dedicated to
    various gathering and processing companies in the
    Fort Worth Basin. The revenues received for all products
    are sold at prevailing market based prices.

Strategy
    and Competition

We manage and operate our Barnett shale gas properties to
    maximize returns on investment and increase earnings with the
    overriding goal of optimizing the cost of producing reserves and
    adding additional proved reserves. We will consider potential
    periodic monetizations where market conditions are appropriate.



From time to time, we use financial derivative contracts to
    manage a portion of our exposure to changes in the price of
    natural gas on our forecasted natural gas sales. The following
    is a summary of the financial contracts in place at
    December 31, 2008 related to Barnett shale production:

We continue to invest in our holdings in the Western portion of
    the Barnett shale and anticipate significant opportunities to
    develop our current position while accumulating additional
    acreage in and around our existing assets. Current economic
    conditions and depressed commodity prices have created
    challenges and opportunities in the Barnett shale. While
    operating margins are expected to be lower than 2008,
    opportunities exist to reduce operating, drilling and completion
    costs primarily due to the increased availability of drilling
    rigs and oil field service companies.

In 2009, we expect to drill approximately 15 to 25 wells in
    the Barnett shale. Investment for the area is expected to be
    approximately $25 million during 2009.

Power
    and Industrial Projects

Description

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects
    that deliver energy and utility-type services to steel,
    automotive and other industrial, commercial and institutional
    customers; provide coal transportation and marketing; and
    develop biomass energy projects. This business segment provides
    utility-type services using project assets usually located on or
    near the customers’ premises in the steel, automotive, pulp
    and paper, airport and other industries.

These services include pulverized coal, petroleum coke and
    metallurgical coke supply, power generation, steam production,
    chilled water production, wastewater treatment and compressed
    air supply. We own and operate one gas-fired peaking electric
    generating plant, two biomass-fired electric generating plants
    and operate one coal-fired power plant under contract. A third
    biomass-fired electric generating plant is currently under
    development pending certain regulatory and management approvals
    with an expected in-service date of January 2010. Production tax
    credits related to two of the coke battery facilities were
    reinstated for the years 2006 through 2009. The coke battery
    facilities produce coke that is used in blast furnaces within
    the steel industry. Detroit Edison provides operations and
    maintenance services for the pulverized coal facility located at
    Detroit Edison’s River Rouge power plant.

We also provide coal transportation services including fuel,
    transportation, storage, blending and rail equipment management
    services. Our external customers include electric utilities,
    merchant power producers, integrated steel mills and large
    industrial companies with significant energy requirements.
    Additionally, we participate in coal marketing and the purchase
    and sale of emissions credits. We own and operate a coal
    transloading terminal in South Chicago, Illinois.

We develop, own and operate landfill gas recovery systems
    throughout the United States. Landfill gas, a byproduct of solid
    waste decomposition, is composed of approximately equal portions
    of methane and carbon dioxide. We develop landfill gas recovery
    systems that capture the gas and provide local utilities,
    industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive,
    renewable source of energy, in addition to providing
    environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
    This business segment performs coal mine methane extraction, in
    which we recover methane gas from mine voids for processing and
    delivery to natural gas pipelines, industrial users or for small
    power generation projects. We own a coal mine methane gathering
    system and gas processing facility.

Discontinuance of Planned Monetization of a Portion of our
    Power and Industrial Projects Business

— During
    the third quarter of 2007, we announced our plans to sell a 50%
    interest in a portfolio of select Power and Industrial Projects.
    During 2008, the United States asset sale market weakened and
    challenges in



the debt market persisted. As a result of these developments,
    our work on this planned monetization was discontinued.

Strategy
    and Competition

Power and Industrial Projects will continue leveraging its
    energy-related operating experience and project management
    capability to develop and grow our steel; renewable power;

on-site

energy; coal transportation, marketing, storage and blending;
    and landfill gas recovery businesses. We also will continue to
    pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations
    services to third parties.

We anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets
    where we operate. In determining the markets in which to
    compete, we examine closely the regulatory and competitive
    environment, the number of competitors and our ability to
    achieve sustainable margins. We plan to maximize the
    effectiveness of our inter-related businesses as we expand from
    our current regional focus. As we pursue growth opportunities,
    our first priority will be to achieve value-added returns.

We intend to focus on the following areas for growth:

•

Providing operating services to owners of industrial and power
    plants; and

•

Acquiring and developing solid fuel-fired power plants, landfill
    gas recovery facilities, renewable energy projects, and other
    energy projects qualifying for tax credits.

Due to a weakened U.S. economy including constricted
    capital and credit markets, we expect significantly lower demand
    for steel in 2009 impacting the financial performance of our
    coke battery and pulverized coal operations. In addition, the
    automotive sector has been severely impacted by the current
    economic situation and has resulted in curtailment of production
    and plant closings. We will continue to monitor the steel and
    automotive industries closely during 2009.

Our Coal Transportation and Marketing business is one of the
    leading North American coal marketers. Trends such as railroad
    and mining consolidation and the lack of certainty in developing
    new mines by many mining firms could have an impact on how we
    compete in the future. In 2011, our existing long-term rail
    transportation contract which gives us a competitive advantage
    will expire. We will continue to work with suppliers and the
    railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to
    meet the energy requirements of our customers. We will seek to
    build our capacity to transport, store and blend greater amounts
    of coal and expect to continue to grow our business in a manner
    consistent with, and complementary to, the growth of our other
    business segments.



Energy
    Trading

Description

Energy Trading focuses on physical power and gas marketing and
    trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from
    DTE Energy’s asset portfolio, optimization of contracted
    natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and power
    transmission and generating capacity positions. Our customer
    base is predominantly utilities, local distribution companies,
    pipelines, and other marketing and trading companies. We enter
    into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing
    and hedging activities. Most of the derivative financial
    instruments are accounted for under the mark-to-market method,
    which results in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses
    from changes in the fair value of the derivatives. We utilize
    forwards, futures, swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk
    associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as
    for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines. Energy
    Trading also provides commodity risk management services to the
    other businesses within DTE Energy.

Significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and
    trading portfolio are economically hedged. The portfolio
    includes financial instruments and gas inventory, as well as
    contracted natural gas pipelines and storage and power
    generation capacity positions. Most financial instruments are
    deemed derivatives, however gas inventory, power transmission,
    pipelines and certain storage assets are not derivatives. As a
    result, this segment may experience earnings volatility as
    derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the
    underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. This results in
    gains and losses that are recognized in different accounting
    periods. We may incur mark-to-market gains or losses in one
    period that could reverse in subsequent periods.

Strategy
    and Competition

Our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver
    value-added services to our customers. We seek to manage this
    business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the
    growth of our other business segments. We focus on physical
    marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy
    assets. We compete with electric and gas marketers, traders,
    utilities and other energy providers. The trading business is
    dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment
    grade credit rating. A material credit restriction would
    negatively impact our financial performance. Competitors with
    greater access to capital or at a lower cost may have a
    competitive advantage. We have risk management and credit
    processes to monitor and mitigate risk.

CORPORATE &
    OTHER

Description

Corporate & Other includes various holding company
    activities and holds certain non-utility debt and energy-related
    investments.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

Synthetic
    Fuel

Description

The Synthetic Fuel business was presented as a non-utility
    segment through the third quarter of 2007. Due to the expiration
    of synfuel production tax credits at the end of 2007, the
    Synthetic Fuel business ceased operations and was classified as
    a discontinued operation as of December 31, 2007. Synfuel
    plants chemically changed coal and waste coal into a synthetic
    fuel as determined under the Internal Revenue Code. Production
    tax credits were provided for the production and sale of solid
    synthetic fuel produced from coal and were available through
    December 31, 2007. To optimize income and cash flow from
    the synfuel operations, we sold interests in all nine of the
    facilities, representing 91% of the total production capacity.
    The synthetic fuel plants generated operating losses that were
    offset by production tax credits.



The value of a production tax credit was adjusted annually by an
    inflation factor and published annually by the Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS). The value of production tax credits for synthetic
    fuel was reduced when the Reference Price of a barrel of oil
    exceeded certain thresholds.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

We are subject to extensive environmental regulation. Additional
    costs may result as the effects of various substances on the
    environment are studied and governmental regulations are
    developed and implemented. Actual costs to comply could vary
    substantially. We expect to continue recovering environmental
    costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our
    customers. The following table summarizes our estimated
    significant future environmental expenditures based upon current

Air —

Detroit Edison is subject to the EPA
    ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant
    emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Since 2005, EPA
    and the State of Michigan have issued additional emission
    reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate,
    regional haze and mercury air pollution. The new rules will lead
    to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
    nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions.

Water —

In response to an EPA regulation,
    Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing
    the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures
    at several of its facilities. Based on the results of studies to
    be conducted over the next several years, Detroit Edison may be
    required to perform some mitigation activities, including the
    possible installation of additional control technologies to
    reduce the environmental impact of the intake structures.
    However, a January 2007 circuit court decision remanded back to
    the EPA several provisions of the federal regulation, resulting
    in a delay in complying with the regulation. In 2008, the
    U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the remanded
    cost-benefit analysis provision of the rule. A decision is
    expected in the first quarter of 2009. Concurrently, the EPA
    continues to develop a revised rule, which is expected to be
    published in early 2009.

Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) and Other Sites —

Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas
    pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured
    locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. The
    facilities, which produced gas for heating and other uses, have
    been designated as MGP sites. Gas Utility owns, or previously
    owned, fifteen such former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP
    sites, we are also in the process of cleaning up other
    contaminated sites. Detroit Edison conducted remedial
    investigations at contaminated sites, including three MGP sites,
    the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and
    aboveground storage tank locations. As a result of these
    determinations, we have recorded liabilities related to these
    sites. Cleanup activities associated with these sites will be
    conducted over the next several years.



Non-utility —

Our non-utility affiliates are
    subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations
    dealing with the protection of the environment from various
    pollutants. We are in the process of installing new
    environmental equipment at our coke battery facility in
    Michigan. We expect the project to be completed in the first
    half of 2009. Our non-utility affiliates are substantially in
    compliance with all environmental requirements.

Global Climate Change —

Proposals for voluntary
    initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed in the
    United States to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide,
    a by-product of burning fossil fuels. There may be legislative
    and or regulatory action to address the issue of changes in
    climate that may result from the build up of greenhouse gases,
    including carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. We cannot predict
    the impact any legislative or regulatory action may have on our
    operations and financial position.

See Notes 5 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

EMPLOYEES

We had 10,471 employees as of December 31, 2008, of
    which 5,331 were represented by unions. The majority of our
    union employees are under contracts that expire in June and
    October 2010 and August 2012.

Under our Bylaws, the officers of DTE Energy are elected
    annually by the Board of Directors at a meeting held for such
    purpose, each to serve until the next annual meeting of
    directors or until their respective successors are chosen and
    qualified.

Pursuant to Article VI of our Articles of Incorporation,
    directors of DTE Energy will not be personally liable to us or
    our shareholders in the performance of their duties to the full
    extent permitted by law.



Article VII of our Articles of Incorporation provides that
    each current or former director or officer of DTE Energy, or
    each current and former employee or agent of the Company or a
    director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
    partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including
    the heirs, executors, administrators or estate of such person),
    shall be indemnified by us to the full extent permitted by the
    Michigan Business Corporation Act or any other applicable laws
    as presently or hereafter in effect. In addition, we have
    entered into indemnification agreements with all of our officers
    and directors; these agreements set forth procedures for claims
    for indemnification as well as contractually obligating us to
    provide indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by law.

We and our directors and officers in their capacities as such
    are insured against liability for alleged wrongful acts (to the
    extent defined) under eight insurance policies providing
    aggregate coverage in the amount of $185 million.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE
    Energy’s utility and non-utility businesses. To provide a
    framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy,
    we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant
    risks associated with our businesses. Although we have tried to
    identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in
    the future. Each of the following risks could affect our
    performance.

Regional and national economic conditions can have an
    unfavorable impact on us.

Our utility and
    non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the
    customers we serve. Our utilities and certain non-utility
    businesses provide services to the domestic automotive industry
    which is under considerable financial distress, exacerbating the
    decline in regional economic conditions. Should national or
    regional economic conditions further decline, reduced volumes of
    electricity and gas, and demand for energy services we supply,
    collections of accounts receivable and potentially higher levels
    of lost or stolen gas will result in decreased earnings and cash
    flow.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect
    us.

Regional and national economic
    condition

s

, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and
    regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic
    performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our
    credit rating. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the
    credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily
    reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating
    could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital
    markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs,
    a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future
    earnings and cash flows. In addition, a reduction in credit
    rating may require us to post collateral related to various
    physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of
    energy-related commodities, products and services, which would
    impact our liquidity.

Our ability to access capital markets at attractive interest
    rates is important.

Our ability to access capital
    markets is important to operate our businesses. In recent
    months, the global financial markets have experienced
    unprecedented instability. This systemic marketplace distress is
    impacting our access to capital and cost of capital. This recent
    turmoil in credit markets has constrained, and may again in the
    future constrain, our ability as well as the ability of our
    subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and
    refinance existing debt. We cannot predict the length of time
    the current worldwide credit situation will continue or the
    impact on our future operations and our ability to issue debt at
    reasonable interest rates. In addition, the level of borrowing
    by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit
    our access to capital markets. We have substantial amounts of
    short-term credit facilities that expire in 2009. We intend to
    seek to renew the facilities on or before the expiration dates.
    However, we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts, which
    could result in a decrease in amounts available and/ or an
    increase in our borrowing costs and negatively impact our
    financial performance.

Poor investment performance of pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting
    benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and
    results of operations.

Our costs of providing
    non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other
    postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of
    factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level
    of interest rates used to measure



the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future
    government regulation, and our required or voluntary
    contributions made to the plans. The performance of the capital
    markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to
    satisfy future obligations under our plans. We have significant
    benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to
    satisfy these obligations. These assets are subject to market
    fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall
    below our projected return rates. A decline in the market value
    of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, as was
    experienced in 2008, will increase the funding requirements
    under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual
    asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable
    future. Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit
    plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As
    interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially
    increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Also, if
    future increases in pension and postretirement benefit costs as
    a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from Detroit
    Edison or MichCon customers, the results of operations and
    financial position of our company could be negatively affected.
    Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to
    increase the value of our plan assets, we could be required to
    fund our plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash
    funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash
    flows, financial position, or results of operations.

If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to
    record a charge to earnings.

We annually review
    the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made
    by the Company for impairment. Factors that may be considered
    for purposes of this analysis include any change in
    circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill
    may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and
    market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth
    rates in our industry. We cannot predict the timing, strength or
    duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery,
    worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate,
    however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the
    Company may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could
    potentially materially impact our results of operations and
    financial position.

Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to
    risk.

Events in the energy trading industry have
    increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business
    and the energy industry as a whole. In certain situations we may
    be required to post collateral to support trading operations,
    which could be substantial. If access to liquidity to support
    trading activities is curtailed, we could experience decreased
    earnings potential and cash flows.

We are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom we
    do business.

Adverse economic conditions
    affecting, or financial difficulties of, counterparties with
    whom we do business could impair the ability of these
    counterparties to pay for our services or fulfill their
    contractual obligations, or cause them to delay such payments or
    obligations. We depend on these counterparties to remit payments
    on a timely basis. Any delay or default in payment could
    adversely affect our cash flows, financial position, or results
    of operations.

We may not be fully covered by insurance.

We
    have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide
    coverage for various types of risks, catastrophic damage as a
    result of acts of God, terrorism, war or a combination of other
    significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations.
    Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our
    insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations.

We are subject to rate regulation.

Electric
    and gas rates for our utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC
    and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. We may
    be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by
    the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. Our ability to
    recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the
    incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in
    customers’ rates. New legislation, regulations or
    interpretations could change how our business operates, impact
    our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require
    us to incur additional expenses.

Michigan’s electric Customer Choice program could
    negatively impact our financial performance.

The
    electric Customer Choice program, as originally contemplated in
    Michigan, anticipated an eventual transition to a totally
    deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be
    charged market-based rates for their electricity. The State of
    Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC
    continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while
    alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates. In
    addition, such regulated electric rates for certain groups of
    our customers exceed the cost of service to those



customers. Due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the
    initial implementation period of electric Customer Choice, many
    commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers. MPSC
    rate orders and recent energy legislation enacted by the State
    of Michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five
    years and have placed a cap on the total potential Customer
    Choice related migration. Recent higher wholesale electric
    prices have also resulted in some former electric Customer
    Choice customers migrating back to Detroit Edison for electric
    generation service. However, even with the electric Customer
    Choice-related relief received in recent Detroit Edison rate
    orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on participation
    in the electric Customer Choice program, there continues to be
    financial risk associated with the electric Customer Choice
    program. Electric Customer Choice migration is sensitive to
    market price and bundled electric service price increases.

Weather significantly affects
    operations.

Deviations from normal hot and cold
    weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow. Mild
    temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets,
    lowering income and cash flow. Ice storms, tornadoes, or high
    winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure
    and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material
    unplanned expenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts
    may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.

Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to
    risk.

Ownership of an operating nuclear
    generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks.
    These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental
    regulation and remediation, and operational factors that can
    significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a
    nuclear facility. While we maintain insurance for various
    nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such
    insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of
    an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating
    plant, which may affect our financial performance.

The supply and price of fuel and other commodities and
    related transportation costs may impact our financial
    results.

We are dependent on coal for much of our
    electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuations, fuel supply
    disruptions and increases in transportation costs could have a
    negative impact on our ability to profitably generate
    electricity. Our access to natural gas supplies is critical to
    ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers. We
    have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in
    place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply
    prices, but there can be no assurances that our financial
    performance will not be negatively impacted by price
    fluctuations. The price of natural gas also impacts the market
    for our non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and
    alternative electric suppliers. Increased transportation costs
    could also impact our non-utility businesses.

Unplanned power plant outages may be
    costly.

Unforeseen maintenance may be required to
    safely produce electricity or comply with environmental
    regulations. As a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be
    required to make spot market purchases of electricity that
    exceed our costs of generation. Our financial performance may be
    negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased
    costs.

Our estimates of gas reserves are subject to
    change.

While we cannot provide absolute
    assurance that our estimates of our Barnett gas reserves are
    accurate, great care is exercised in utilizing historical
    information and assumptions to develop reasonable estimates of
    future production and cash flow. We estimate proved gas reserves
    and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves.
    There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
    quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable to
    such reserves, including factors beyond our control. Reserve
    engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground
    accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner.
    The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of
    cash flows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the
    available data, assumptions regarding expenditures for future
    development and exploration activities, and of engineering and
    geological interpretation and judgment. Additionally, reserves
    and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or
    upward revisions, based upon production history, development and
    exploration activities and prices of gas. Actual future
    production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating
    expenses, quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of
    cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the
    assumptions and underlying information we used.

Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be
    limited.

To reduce U.S. dependence on
    imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax
    credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and
    electricity from alternative sources. We have generated
    production tax credits from the synfuel, coke



production, landfill gas recovery, biomass fired electric
    generation and gas production operations. We have received
    favorable private letter rulings on all of the synfuel
    facilities. All production tax credits taken after 2003 are
    subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If our
    production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a
    result of an IRS audit, there could be additional tax
    liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that
    could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows. We have
    also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction
    with the sales of interests in the synfuel facilities.

We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.

DTE
    Energy is a holding company. Cash flows from our utility and
    non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses
    and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities. Should a major
    subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows
    to DTE Energy, our ability to pay interest and dividends would
    be restricted.

Environmental laws and liability may be
    costly.

We are subject to numerous environmental
    regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water
    quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and
    hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can
    significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and
    plant down times. These laws and regulations require us to seek
    a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and
    other regulatory approvals. Additionally, we may become a
    responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified
    by a regulatory body. We cannot predict with certainty the
    amount and timing of future expenditures related to
    environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating
    clean up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying
    liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and
    several liability on potentially responsible parties.

We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future
    requirements to address climate change issues. Proposals for
    voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed
    both in the United States and worldwide to reduce greenhouse
    gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil
    fuels. If increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are
    implemented, the operations of our fossil-fuel generation assets
    may be significantly impacted.

Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be
    recovered through the regulatory process, our financial
    performance may be negatively impacted as a result of
    environmental matters.

Terrorism could affect our business.

Damage to
    downstream infrastructure or our own assets by terrorism would
    impact our operations. We have increased security as a result of
    past events and further security increases are possible.

Benefits of continuous improvement initiatives could be less
    than we expect.

We have a continuous improvement
    program that is expected to result in significant cost savings.
    Actual results achieved through this program could be less than
    our expectations.

A work interruption may adversely affect
    us.

Unions represent approximately 5,000 of our
    employees. A union choosing to strike would have an impact on
    our business. We are unable to predict the effect a work
    stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial
    performance.

Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and
    other skilled professional and technical employees could have an
    adverse effect on our operations.

Our business is
    dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate
    employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is
    high and the inability to retain and attract these employees
    could adversely affect our business and future operating results.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are involved in certain legal, regulatory, administrative and
    environmental proceedings before various courts, arbitration
    panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in
    the ordinary course of business. These proceedings include
    certain contract disputes, environmental reviews and
    investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and
    pending judicial matters. We cannot predict the final
    disposition of such



proceedings. We regularly review legal matters and record
    provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss. The
    resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a
    material effect on our operations or financial statements in the
    period they are resolved.

We are aware of attempts by an environmental organization known
    as the Waterkeeper Alliance to initiate a criminal action in
    Canada against the Company for alleged violations of the
    Canadian Fisheries Act. Fines under the relevant Canadian
    statute could potentially be significant. To date, the Company
    has not been properly served process in this matter.
    Nevertheless, as a result of a decision by a Canadian court, a
    trial schedule has been initiated. The Company believes the
    claims of the Waterkeeper Alliance in this matter are without
    legal merit and has appealed the court’s decision. We are
    not able to predict or assess the outcome of this action at this
    time.

In February 2008, DTE Energy was named as one of approximately
    24 defendant oil, power and coal companies in a lawsuit filed in
    a United States District Court. DTE Energy was served with
    process in March 2008. The plaintiffs, the Native Village of
    Kivalina and City of Kivalina, which are home to approximately
    400 people in Alaska, claim that the defendants’
    business activities have contributed to global warming and, as a
    result, higher temperatures are damaging the local economy and
    leaving the island more vulnerable to storm activity in the fall
    and winter. As a result, the plaintiffs are seeking damages of
    up to $400 million for relocation costs associated with
    moving the village to a safer location, as well as unspecified
    attorney’s fees and expenses. The defendants filed motions
    to dismiss. The motions are pending before the court. DTE Energy
    believes this claim is without merit, but is not able to predict
    or assess the outcome of this lawsuit at this time.

The City of Detroit Water and Sewer Department (DWSD) has a suit
    pending in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
    Michigan against EES Coke Battery, LLC (EES Coke), which is an
    indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, alleging that
    certain constituents of waste water discharged by EES Coke into
    DWSD’s sewer system exceeded the permitted amounts. DWSD
    has requested that EES Coke be required to obtain a new permit
    and to pay fines for past excess amounts. DWSD and EES Coke have
    negotiated a consent order to settle this matter that is
    expected to require EES Coke to pay fines in excess of $100,000.
    The consent order is subject to final approval of the court. EES
    Coke is making capital improvements that are intended to prevent
    exceedances of the permitted amounts in the future.

At December 31, 2008, there were 163,019,596 shares of
    our common stock outstanding. These shares were held by a total
    of 82,706 shareholders of record.

Our Bylaws nullify Chapter 7B of the Michigan Business
    Corporation Act (Act). This Act regulates shareholder rights
    when an individual’s stock ownership reaches 20% of a
    Michigan corporation’s outstanding shares. A shareholder
    seeking control of the Company cannot require our Board of
    Directors to call a meeting to vote on issues related to
    corporate control within 10 days, as stipulated by the Act.

We paid cash dividends on our common stock of $344 million
    in 2008, $364 million in 2007, and $365 million in
    2006. The amount of future dividends will depend on our
    earnings, cash flows, financial condition and other factors that
    are periodically reviewed by our Board of Directors. Although
    there can be no assurances, we anticipate paying dividends for
    the foreseeable future.

See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report for information on
    dividend restrictions.

All of our equity compensation plans that provide for the annual
    awarding of stock-based compensation have been approved by
    shareholders. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated

In January 2005, the DTE Energy Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of up to $700 million of common stock
    through 2008. In May 2007, the DTE Energy Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
    $850 million of common stock through 2009. Through
    December 31, 2008, repurchases of approximately
    $725 million of common stock were made under these
    authorizations. These authorizations provide management with
    flexibility to pursue share repurchases from time to time and
    will depend on actual and future asset monetizations, cash flows
    and investment opportunities.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

DTE Energy is a diversified energy company with 2008 operating
    revenues in excess of $9 billion and over $24 billion
    in assets. We are the parent company of Detroit Edison and
    MichCon, regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily
    in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales,
    distribution and storage services throughout southeastern
    Michigan. We operate four energy-related non-utility segments
    with operations throughout the United States.

The following table summarizes our financial results:

The decrease in 2008 from 2007 was primarily due to
    approximately $370 million in net income resulting from the
    2007 gain on the sale of the Antrim shale gas exploration and
    production business of $900 million ($580 million
    after-tax), partially offset by losses recognized on related
    hedges of $323 million ($210 million



after-tax), including recognition of amounts previously recorded
    in accumulated other comprehensive income during 2007. Net
    income in 2008 was also impacted by a gain of $128 million
    ($81 million after-tax) on the sale of a portion of the
    Barnett shale properties.

UTILITY
    OPERATIONS

Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison, which
    is engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution and sale of
    electricity to approximately 2.2 million customers in
    southeastern Michigan.

Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens.
    MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage, transmission,
    distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately
    1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial
    customers throughout Michigan. MichCon also has subsidiaries
    involved in the gathering, processing and transmission of
    natural gas in northern Michigan. Citizens distributes natural
    gas in Adrian, Michigan to approximately 17,000 customers.

Impact of national and regional economic conditions on our
    utility operations

— Revenues from our utility
    operations follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve.
    Our utilities provide services to the domestic automotive
    industry which is under considerable financial distress,
    exacerbating the decline in regional conditions. In 2008,
    Detroit Edison experienced a decline in sales in its service
    territory as compared to 2007. We expect this decline to
    continue in 2009. As discussed further below, deteriorating
    economic conditions impact our ability to collect amounts due
    from our customers of our electric and gas utilities and drive
    higher levels of lost and stolen natural gas at MichCon. In the
    face of the economic conditions, we are actively managing our
    cash, capital expenditures, cost structure and liquidity to
    maintain our financial strength.

Effects of Weather on Utility Operations

—
    Earnings from our utility operations are seasonal and very
    sensitive to weather. Electric utility earnings are primarily
    dependent on hot summer weather, while the gas utility’s
    results are primarily dependent on cold winter weather. During
    the year ended December 31, 2008 we experienced colder
    weather than the year ended December 31, 2007.

Additionally, we frequently experience various types of storms
    that damage our electric distribution infrastructure, resulting
    in power outages. Restoration and other costs associated with
    storm-related power outages lowered pre-tax earnings by
    $61 million in 2008, $68 million in 2007 and
    $46 million in 2006.

Collectibility of Accounts Receivable on Utility
    Operations

— Both utilities continue to experience
    high levels of past due receivables, which is primarily
    attributable to economic conditions including high levels of



unemployment and home foreclosures. High energy prices and a
    lack of adequate levels of assistance for low-income customers
    have also impacted our accounts receivable.

We have taken actions to manage the level of past due
    receivables, including customer disconnections, contracting with
    collection agencies and working with Michigan officials and
    others to increase the share of low-income funding allocated to
    our customers.

Our uncollectible accounts expense for the two utilities
    increased to $213 million in 2008 from $135 million in
    2007 and from $123 million in 2006.

The April 2005 MPSC gas rate order provided for an uncollectible

true-up

mechanism for MichCon. The uncollectible

true-up

mechanism enables MichCon to recover ninety percent of the
    difference between the actual uncollectible expense for each
    year and $37 million after an annual reconciliation
    proceeding before the MPSC. The MPSC approved the 2005 annual
    reconciliation in December 2006, allowing MichCon to surcharge
    $11 million beginning in January 2007. The MPSC approved
    the 2006 annual reconciliation in December 2007, allowing
    MichCon to surcharge $33 million beginning in January 2008.
    In December 2008, MichCon received authorization to surcharge
    $34 million, including a $1 million uncollected
    balance from the 2005 surcharge, beginning in January 2009. We
    accrue interest income on the outstanding balances.

Impact of Regulatory Decisions on Utility
    Operations

— On December 23, 2008, the MPSC
    issued an order in Detroit Edison’s February 20, 2008
    updated rate case filing. The MPSC approved an annual revenue
    increase of $84 million effective January 14, 2009 or
    a 2.0% average increase in Detroit Edison’s annual revenue
    requirement for 2009. Included in the approved $84 million
    increase in revenues was a return on equity of 11% on an
    expected 49% equity and 51% debt capital structure.

Other key aspects of the MPSC order include the following:

•

In order to more accurately reflect the actual cost of providing
    service to business customers, the MPSC adopted an immediate 39%
    phase out of the residential rate subsidy, with the remaining
    amount to be eliminated in equal installments over the next five
    years, every October 1.

•

Accepted Detroit Edison’s proposal to reinstate and modify
    the tracking mechanism on Electric Choice sales (CIM) with
    a base level of 1,561 GWh. The modified mechanism will not have
    a cap on the amount recoverable.

•

Terminated the Pension Equalization Mechanism.

•

Approved an annual reconciliation mechanism to track expenses
    associated with restoration costs (storm and non-storm related
    expenses) and line clearance expenses. Annual reconciliations
    will be required using a base expense level of $110 million
    and $51 million, respectively.

•

Approved Detroit Edison’s proposal to recover a return on
    $15 million in working capital associated with the
    preparation of an application for a new nuclear generation
    facility at its current Fermi 2 site.

The MPSC issued an order on August 31, 2006 approving a
    settlement agreement providing for an annualized rate reduction
    of $53 million for 2006 for Detroit Edison, effective
    September 5, 2006. Beginning January 1, 2007, and
    continuing until April 13, 2008, rates were reduced by an
    additional $26 million, for a total reduction of
    $79 million annually. Detroit Edison experienced a rate
    reduction of approximately $76 million in 2007 and
    approximately $25 million during the period the rate
    reduction was in effect for 2008, as a result of this order. The
    revenue reduction was net of the recovery of costs associated
    with the Performance Excellence Process. The settlement
    agreement provided for some level of realignment of the existing
    rate structure by allocating a larger percentage of the rate
    reduction to the commercial and industrial customer classes than
    to the residential customer classes.

In August 2006, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC
    requesting permission to sell base gas that would become
    accessible with storage facilities upgrades. In December 2006,
    MichCon filed its

2007-2008

GCR plan case proposing a maximum GCR factor of $8.49 per Mcf.
    In August 2007, a settlement agreement in this proceeding was
    approved by the MPSC that provides for a sharing with customers
    of the proceeds from the sale of base gas. In addition, the
    agreement provides for a rate case filing moratorium until
    January 1, 2009,



unless certain unanticipated changes occur that impact income by
    more than $5 million. MichCon’s gas storage
    enhancement projects, the main subject of the aforementioned
    settlement, have enabled 17 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of gas
    to become available for cycling. Under the settlement terms,
    MichCon delivered 13.4 Bcf of this gas to its customers
    through 2007 at a savings to market-priced supplies of
    approximately $41 million. This settlement also provided
    for MichCon to retain the proceeds from the sale of 3.6 Bcf
    of base gas, of which MichCon sold 0.75 Bcf of base gas in
    2007 at a pre-tax gain of $5 million and 2.84 Bcf in
    December 2008 at a pre-tax gain of $22 million. In July
    2008, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC requesting
    permission to sell an additional 4 Bcf of base gas that
    will become available for sale as a result of better than
    expected operations at its storage fields. MichCon proposed to
    sell 1.3 Bcf of the base gas to GCR customers during the

2009-2010

GCR period at cost and to sell the remaining 2.7 Bcf to
    non-system supply customers in 2009 at market prices. MichCon
    requested that the MPSC treat the proceeds from the sale of the
    2.7 Bcf of base gas to non-system supply customers as a
    one-time increase in MichCon’s net income and not include
    the proceeds in the calculation of MichCon’s revenue
    requirements in future rate cases.

Impact of Legislation on Utility Operations

—
    On September 18, 2008, the Michigan House of
    Representatives and Michigan Senate passed a package of bills to
    establish a comprehensive, sustainable, long-term energy plan
    for Michigan. The Governor of Michigan signed the bills on
    October 6, 2008.

The package of bills includes:

•

2008 Public Act (PA) 286 that reforms Michigan’s utility
    regulatory framework, including the electric Customer Choice
    program,

•

2008 PA 295 that establishes a renewable
    portfolio / energy optimization standard and provides
    a funding mechanism, and

•

2008 PA 287 that provides for an income tax credit for the
    purchase of energy efficient appliances and a credit to offset a
    portion of the renewable charge.

2008 PA 286 makes the following changes in the regulatory
    framework for Michigan utilities.

•

Electric Customer Choice reform

— The bill
    establishes a 10 percent limit on participation in the
    electric Customer Choice program. In general, customers
    representing 10 percent of a utility’s load may
    receive electric generation from an electric supplier that is
    not a utility. After that threshold is met, the remaining
    customers will remain on full, bundled utility service. As of
    December 31, 2008, approximately 3 percent of Detroit
    Edison’s load was on the electric Customer Choice program.
    The bill also allows continuation of prior MPSC policies for
    customers to return to full utility service.

•

Cost-of-service based electric rates (deskewing)

— The bill requires the MPSC to set rates based on
    cost-of-service for all customer classes, eliminating over a
    five-year period the current subsidy by businesses of
    residential customer rates. This provision does not change total
    revenue for Detroit Edison. It lowers rates for most commercial
    and industrial customers and increases rates for residential and
    certain other industrial customers to match the actual cost of
    service for each customer class. Rate changes will be phased in
    over five years, with a 2.5% annual cap on residential rate
    increases due to deskewing beginning January 1, 2009. Rates
    for schools and other qualified educational institutions will be
    set at their cost of service sooner.

•

File and use ratemaking

— The bill establishes
    a 12 month deadline for the MPSC to complete a rate case
    and allows a utility to self-implement rate changes six months
    after a rate filing, subject to certain limitations. If the
    final case order leads to lower rates than the utility had
    self-implemented, the utility will refund with interest, the
    difference. In addition, utility rate cases may be based on a
    forward test year. The bill also has provisions designed to help
    the MPSC obtain increased funding for additional staff.

•

Certificate of Need process for major capital investments

— The bill establishes a certificate of need
    process for capital projects costing more than
    $500 million. The process requires the MPSC to review for
    prudence, prior to construction, proposed investments in new
    generating assets, acquisitions of existing power plants, major
    upgrades of power plants, and long-term power purchase
    agreements. The



bill increases the certainty for utilities to recover the cost
    of projects approved by the MPSC and provides for the utilities
    to recover interest expenses during construction.

•

Merger & Acquisition approval

— The
    bill grants the MPSC the authority to review and approve
    proposed utility mergers and acquisitions in Michigan and sets
    out evaluation criteria.

2008 PA 295 establishes renewable energy and energy
    optimization (energy efficiency, energy conservation or load
    management) programs in Michigan and provides for a separate
    funding surcharge to pay the cost of those programs. In
    accordance with the new law, the MPSC issued a temporary order
    on December 4, 2008 implementing this act. Within
    90 days following the issuance of the temporary order,
    Detroit Edison is required to file a Renewable Portfolio
    Standard (RPS) plan with the MPSC. In addition, Detroit Edison
    and MichCon are required to file Energy Optimization plans with
    the MPSC.

Renewable
    Energy Standard

•

The bill requires electric providers to source 10% of
    electricity sold to retail customers from renewable energy
    resources by 2015.

•

Qualifying renewable energy resources include wind, biomass,
    solar, hydro, and geothermal, among others.

•

Detroit Edison will be required to have a renewable energy
    capacity portfolio of 300MW by December 31, 2013 and 600MW
    by December 31, 2015.

•

The MPSC will establish a per meter surcharge to fund the
    renewable energy requirements. The recovery mechanism starts
    prior to actual construction in order to smooth the rate impact
    for customers.

•

The bill allows for the lowering of compliance if RPS costs
    exceed the surcharge/cost cap or if other specified factors
    adversely affect the availability of renewable energy.

•

The bill specifies that a utility can build or have others build
    and later sell to the utility up to 50 percent of the
    generation required to meet the RPS. The other 50 percent
    would be contracted through power purchase agreements.

•

The bill also provides for a net metering program to be
    established by MPSC order for

on-site

customer-owned renewable generation up to 1% of an electric
    utility’s load.

Energy
    Optimization Standard

•

Requires utilities to create electric and natural gas energy
    optimization plans for each customer class and includes funding
    surcharges as well as the potential for incentives for exceeding
    performance goals.

•

For electric sales, the program targets 0.3 percent annual
    savings in 2009, ramping up to 1 percent annual savings by
    2012. Savings percentages are based on prior year retail sales.

•

For natural gas sales, the targeted annual savings start at
    0.1 percent in 2009 and ramp up to 0.75 percent by
    2012.

•

The MPSC will allow utilities to capitalize certain costs of
    their energy optimization program. The costs which can be
    capitalized include equipment, materials, installation costs and
    customer incentives.

•

Incentives are potentially available for exceeding annual
    program targets. The financial incentive could be the lesser of
    25% of the net cost reduction to our customers or 15% of total
    program spend, subject to MPSC approval.

•

The bill would also allow a natural gas utility that spends at
    least 0.5 percent of its revenues on energy efficiency
    programs to implement a symmetrical decoupling

true-up

mechanism that adjusts for sales volumes that are above or below
    the level reflected in its gas distribution rates.

•

By March 2016, the MPSC may suspend the program if it determines
    the program is no longer cost-effective.



Impact of Increased Market Demand on Coal
    Supply

— Our generating fleet produces
    approximately 79% of its electricity from coal. Increasing coal
    demand from domestic and international markets has resulted in
    volatility and higher prices which are passed to our customers
    through the PSCR mechanism. The demand and price volatility have
    been dampened by the recent economic downturn, but are expected
    to increase as the economy improves. In addition, difficulty in
    recruiting workers, obtaining environmental permits and finding
    economically recoverable amounts of new coal have resulted in
    decreasing coal output from the central Appalachian region.
    Furthermore, as a result of environmental regulation and
    declining eastern coal stocks, demand for cleaner burning
    western coal has increased.

Challenges Associated with Nuclear Fuel

— We
    operate one nuclear facility (Fermi 2) that undergoes a
    periodic refueling outage approximately every eighteen months.
    Uranium prices have been rising due to supply concerns. In the
    future, there may be additional nuclear facilities constructed
    in the industry that may place additional pressure on uranium
    supplies and prices. We have a contract with the
    U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the future storage and
    disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2. We are obligated to
    pay the DOE a fee of 1 mill per kWh of Fermi 2 electricity
    generated and sold; this fee is a component of nuclear fuel
    expense. Delays have occurred in the DOE’s program for the
    acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent
    repository. We are a party in litigation against the DOE for
    both past and future costs associated with the DOE’s
    failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the timetable set
    forth in the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Until the
    DOE is able to fulfill its obligation under the contract, we are
    responsible for the spent nuclear fuel storage and have begun
    work on an

on-site

dry
    cask storage facility.

NON-UTILITY
    OPERATIONS

We have made significant investments in non-utility
    asset-intensive businesses. We employ disciplined investment
    criteria when assessing opportunities that leverage our assets,
    skills and expertise. Specifically, we invest in targeted energy
    markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful
    scale is in alignment with our risk profile. As part of a
    strategic review of our non-utility operations, we have taken
    various actions including the sale of certain non-utility
    businesses.

Gas
    Midstream

Gas Midstream owns partnership interests in two interstate
    transmission pipelines and two natural gas storage fields. The
    pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by
    long-term, fixed-price revenue contracts. We have a partnership
    interest in Vector Pipeline (Vector), an interstate transmission
    pipeline, which connects Michigan to Chicago and Ontario. We
    also hold partnership interests in Millennium Pipeline Company
    which indirectly connects southern New York State to Upper
    Midwest/Canadian supply, while providing transportation service
    into the New York City markets. We have storage assets in
    Michigan capable of storing up to 87 Bcf in natural gas
    storage fields located in Southeast Michigan. The Washington 10
    and 28 storage facilities are high deliverability storage fields
    having bi-directional interconnections with Vector Pipeline and
    MichCon providing our customers access to the Chicago, Michigan,
    other Midwest and Ontario market centers. The pipeline business
    is expanding and building new pipeline capacity to serve markets
    in Northeast United States.

Unconventional
    Gas Production

Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural
    gas exploration, development and production within the Barnett
    shale in north Texas. We continue to develop our position here,
    with total leasehold acreage of 62,395 (60,435 acres, net
    of interest of others). We continue to acquire select positions
    in active development areas in the Barnett shale to optimize our
    existing portfolio.

Monetization of Portions of our Unconventional Gas Production
    Business

— In 2008, we sold a portion of our
    Barnett shale properties for gross proceeds of approximately
    $260 million. The properties sold included 75 Bcfe of
    proved reserves on approximately 11,000 net acres in the
    core area of the Barnett shale. The Company recognized a
    cumulative pre-tax gain of $128 million ($81 million
    after-tax) on the sale during 2008.



We plan to continue to develop our holdings in the western
    portion of the Barnett shale and to seek opportunities for
    additional monetization of select properties within our Barnett
    shale holdings, when conditions are appropriate. We invested
    approximately $96 million in the Barnett shale in 2008 and
    expect to invest approximately $25 million in 2009. During
    2009, we expect to drill 15 to 25 new wells and achieve Barnett
    shale production of approximately 5-6 Bcfe of natural gas,
    compared with approximately 5 Bcfe in 2008.

As a component of our risk management strategy for our Barnett
    shale reserves, we hedged a portion of anticipated production
    from our reserves to secure an attractive investment return. As
    of December 31, 2008, we have a series of cash flow hedges
    for approximately 3.2 Bcf of anticipated Barnett gas
    production through 2010 at an average price of $7.33 per Mcf.

Due to the impairment of acreage and wells in the southern
    expansion area of the Barnett shale during 2007, the proved
    reserves and acreage numbers above do not include the southern
    area. Total net acreage related to impaired leases in the
    southern expansion area was 23,659 acres and
    32,083 acres for the years



Power
    and Industrial Projects

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects
    that deliver energy and utility-type products and services to
    industrial, commercial and institutional customers; provide coal
    transportation and marketing; and sell electricity from
    biomass-fired energy projects. This business segment provides
    utility-type services using project assets usually located on or
    near the customers’ premises in the steel, automotive, pulp
    and paper, airport and other industries.

Services provided include pulverized coal, petroleum coke and
    metallurgical coke supply, power generation, steam production,
    chilled water production, wastewater treatment and compressed
    air supply. We own and operate one gas-fired peaking electric
    generating plant, two biomass-fired electric generating plants
    and operate one coal-fired power plant. A third biomass-fired
    electric generating plant is currently under development pending
    certain regulatory and management approvals with an expected
    in-service date of January 2010. This business segment also
    develops, owns and operates landfill gas recovery systems
    throughout the United States and produces metallurgical coke
    from three coke batteries. The production of coke from two of
    the coke batteries generates production tax credits. The
    business provides coal transportation — related
    services including fuel, transportation, storage, blending and
    rail equipment management services. We specialize in minimizing
    fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for
    energy-intensive customers. Additionally, we participate in coal
    marketing and the purchase and sale of emissions credits. This
    business segment performs coal mine methane extraction, in which
    we recover methane gas from mine voids for processing and
    delivery to natural gas pipelines, industrial users or for small
    power generation projects.

Discontinuance of Planned Monetization of our Power and
    Industrial Projects Business —

During the third
    quarter of 2007, we announced our plans to sell a 50% interest
    in a portfolio of select Power and Industrial Projects. As a
    result, the assets and liabilities of the Projects were
    classified as held for sale at that time. During 2008, the
    United States asset sale market weakened and challenges in the
    debt market persisted. As a result of these developments, our
    work on this planned monetization was discontinued. As of
    June 30, 2008, the assets and liabilities of the Projects
    are no longer classified as held for sale.

Energy
    Trading

Energy Trading focuses on physical power and gas marketing and
    trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from
    DTE Energy’s asset portfolio and the optimization of
    contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and
    power transmission and generating capacity positions. Our
    customer base is predominantly utilities, local distribution
    companies, pipelines, and other marketing and trading companies.
    We enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our
    marketing and hedging activities. Most of the derivative
    financial instruments are accounted for under the mark-to-market
    method, which results in the recognition of unrealized gains and
    losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives. We
    utilize forwards, futures, swaps and option contracts to
    mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity
    as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk
    guidelines. Energy Trading also provides commodity risk
    management services to the other businesses within DTE Energy.



Significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and
    trading portfolio are economically hedged. The portfolio
    includes financial instruments and gas inventory, as well as
    contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage and
    power generation capacity positions. Most financial instruments
    are deemed derivatives, whereas proprietary gas inventory, power
    transmission, pipelines and certain storage assets are not
    derivatives. As a result, this segment may experience earnings
    volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing
    the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. This results
    in gains and losses that are recognized in different accounting
    periods. We may incur mark-to-market accounting gains or losses
    in one period that could reverse in subsequent periods.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

Synthetic
    Fuel

The Synthetic Fuel business was presented as a non-utility
    segment through the third quarter of 2007. Due to the expiration
    of synfuel production tax credits at the end of 2007, the
    Synthetic Fuel business ceased operations and

was classified as a discontinued operation as of
    December 31, 2007. Synfuel plants chemically changed coal
    and waste coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the
    Internal Revenue Code. Production tax credits were provided for
    the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from
    coal and were available through December 31, 2007. To
    optimize income and cash flow from synfuel operations, we sold
    interests in all nine of the facilities, representing 91% of the
    total production capacity. The synthetic fuel plants generated
    operating losses that were offset by production tax credits.

The value of a production tax credit was adjusted annually by an
    inflation factor and published annually by the IRS. The value of
    production tax credits for synthetic fuel was reduced when the
    Reference Price of a barrel of oil exceeded certain thresholds.
    The actual tax credit phase-out for 2007 was approximately 67%.

CAPITAL
    INVESTMENT

We anticipate significant capital investment across all of our
    business segments. Most of our capital expenditures will be
    concentrated within our utility segments. Our electric utility
    segment currently expects to invest approximately
    $6 billion (excluding investments in new generation
    capacity, if any), including increased environmental
    requirements and reliability enhancement projects during the
    period of 2009 through 2013. Our gas utility segment currently
    expects to invest approximately $750 million to
    $800 million on system expansion, pipeline safety and
    reliability enhancement projects through the same period. We
    plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital
    expenditures within our regulatory rate base consistent with
    prior treatment. Due to the economy and credit market
    conditions, we are continually reviewing our capital expenditure
    commitments for potential reductions and deferrals and plan to
    adjust spending as appropriate.

OUTLOOK

The next few years will be a period of rapid change for DTE
    Energy and for the energy industry. Our strong utility base,
    combined with our integrated non-utility operations, position us
    well for long-term growth.

Looking forward, we will focus on several areas that we expect
    will improve future performance:

•

continuing to pursue regulatory stability and investment
    recovery for our utilities;

•

managing the growth of our utility asset base;

•

enhancing our cost structure across all business segments;

•

managing cash, capital and liquidity to maintain or improve our
    financial strength;

•

improving Electric and Gas Utility customer satisfaction; and

•

investing in businesses that integrate our assets and leverage
    our skills and expertise.



We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses
    in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet
    our strategic, financial and risk criteria.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Segments realigned —

Beginning in the second
    quarter of 2008, we have realigned our Coal Transportation and
    Marketing business from the Coal and Gas Midstream segment (now
    the Gas Midstream segment) to the Power and Industrial Projects
    segment due to changes in how financial information is evaluated
    and resources allocated to segments by senior management. The
    Company’s segment information reflects this change for all
    periods presented. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further
    information on this realignment. The following sections provide
    a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future
    outlook of our segments.

ELECTRIC
    UTILITY

Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison.

Factors impacting income:

Net income increased
    $14 million in 2008 and decreased $8 million in 2007.
    The 2008 increase was primarily due to lower expenses for
    operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and
    taxes other than income, partly offset by lower gross margins
    and higher income tax expense. The 2007 decrease reflects higher
    operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher
    gross margins and lower depreciation and amortization expenses.

Gross margin

decreased $118 million during 2008 and
    increased $43 million in 2007. The 2008 decrease was due to
    the unfavorable impacts of weather and service territory
    performance and the absence of the favorable impact of a May
    2007 MPSC order related to the 2005 PSCR reconciliation. These
    decreases were partially offset by higher rates attributable to
    the April 2008 expiration of a rate reduction related to the
    MPSC show cause proceeding and higher margins due to customers
    returning from the electric Customer Choice program. The
    increase in 2007 was attributed to higher margins due to
    returning sales from electric Customer Choice, the favorable
    impact of a May 2007 MPSC order related to the 2005 PSCR
    reconciliation and weather related impacts, partially offset by
    lower rates resulting primarily from the August 2006 settlement
    in the MPSC show cause proceeding and the unfavorable impact of
    a September 2006 MPSC order related to the 2004 PSCR
    reconciliation. Revenues include a component for the cost of
    power sold that is recoverable through the PSCR mechanism.

Operation and maintenance

expense decreased
    $100 million in 2008 and increased $86 million in
    2007. The decrease in 2008 was due primarily to lower
    information systems implementation costs of $60 million,
    lower benefit expense of $45 million and lower corporate
    support expenses of $29 million, partially offset by higher
    uncollectible expenses of $22 million. The increase in 2007
    is primarily due to higher information systems implementation
    costs of $30 million, higher storm expenses of
    $22 million, increased uncollectible expense of
    $22 million and higher corporate support expenses of
    $20 million.



Depreciation and amortization

expense decreased
    $21 million in 2008 and $45 million in 2007. The 2008
    decrease was due primarily to decreased amortization of
    regulatory assets. The 2007 decrease was due primarily to a
    2006 net stranded cost write-off of $112 million
    related to the September 2006 MPSC order regarding stranded
    costs and a $13 million decrease in our asset retirement
    obligation at our Fermi 1 nuclear facility, partially offset by
    $58 million of increased amortization of regulatory assets
    and $13 million of higher depreciation expense due to
    increased levels of depreciable plant assets.

Taxes other than income

decreased $45 million in
    2008 due to the Michigan Single Business Tax (SBT) expense in
    2007, which was replaced with the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) in
    2008. The MBT is accounted for in the Income Tax provision.

Asset (gains) losses and reserves, net

decreased
    $9 million in 2008 and increased $14 million in 2007
    due to a 2007 $13 million reserve for a loan guaranty
    related to Detroit Edison’s former ownership of a steam
    heating business now owned by Thermal Ventures II, LP (Thermal).

Other (income) and deductions

expense increased
    $6 million in 2008 and decreased $17 million in 2007.
    The 2008 increase is attributable to $15 million of
    investment losses in a trust utilized for retirement benefits
    and $3 million of miscellaneous expenses offset by higher
    capitalized interest of $12 million. The 2007 decrease is
    attributable to a $10 million contribution to the DTE
    Energy Foundation in 2006 that did not recur in 2007,
    $3 million of higher interest income and $17 million
    of increased miscellaneous utility related services, partially
    offset by $16 million of higher interest expense.

Outlook

— We will move forward in our efforts
    to continue to improve the operating performance and cash flow
    of Detroit Edison. We continue to resolve outstanding regulatory
    issues by pursuing regulatory

and/or

legislative solutions. Many of these issues and problems have
    been addressed by the legislation signed by the Governor of
    Michigan in October 2008, discussed more fully in the Overview
    section. Looking forward, additional issues, such as volatility
    in prices for coal and other commodities, investment returns and
    changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans, health
    care costs and higher levels of capital spending, will result in
    us taking meaningful action to address our costs while
    continuing to provide quality customer service. We will continue
    to seek opportunities to improve productivity, remove waste and
    decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction.

Unfavorable national and regional economic trends have resulted
    in reduced demand for electricity in our service territory and
    increases in our uncollectible accounts receivable. The
    magnitude of these trends will be driven by the impacts of the
    challenges in the domestic automotive industry and the timing
    and level of recovery in the national and regional economies.

Due to the economy and credit market conditions, in the near
    term, we are reviewing our capital expenditure commitments for
    potential reductions and deferrals and plan to adjust the timing
    of projects as appropriate. Long term, we will be required to
    invest an estimated $2.8 billion on emission controls
    through 2018. We intend to seek recovery of these investments in
    future rate cases.

Additionally, our service territory may require additional
    generation capacity. A new base-load generating plant has not
    been built within the State of Michigan in over 20 years.
    Should our economic and regulatory environment be conducive to
    such a significant capital expenditure, we may build, upgrade or
    co-invest in a base-load coal facility or a new nuclear plant.

On September 18, 2008, Detroit Edison submitted a Combined
    Operating License Application with the NRC for construction and
    operation of a possible 1,500 MW nuclear power plant at the
    site of the company’s existing Fermi 2 nuclear plant. We
    have not decided on construction of a new base-load nuclear
    plant; however, by completing the license application before the
    end of 2008, we may qualify for financial incentives under the
    Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005. In addition, Detroit Edison
    is also moving ahead with plans for renewable energy resources
    and an aggressive energy efficiency program.

The following variables, either individually or in combination,
    could impact our future results:

•

Access to capital markets and capital market conditions and the
    results of other financing efforts which can be affected by
    credit agency ratings;



•

Instability in capital markets which could impact availability
    of short and long-term financing or the potential for loss on
    cash equivalents and investments;

•

Economic conditions within Michigan and corresponding impacts on
    demand for electricity;

•

Collectibility of accounts receivable;

•

Increases in future expense and contributions to pension and
    other postretirement plans due to declines in value resulting
    from market conditions;

•

The amount and timing of cost recovery allowed as a result of
    regulatory proceedings, related appeals or new legislation;

•

Our ability to reduce costs and maximize plant and distribution
    system performance;

•

Variations in market prices of power, coal and gas;

•

Weather, including the severity and frequency of storms;

•

The level of customer participation in the electric Customer
    Choice program; and

•

Any potential new federal and state environmental, renewable
    energy and energy efficiency requirements.

GAS
    UTILITY

Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens.

Factors impacting income:

Gas Utility’s
    net income increased $15 million in 2008 and
    $20 million in 2007. The 2008 and 2007 increases were due
    primarily to higher gross margins.

increased $63 million and
    $19 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in
    2008 reflects $49 million from the uncollectible tracking
    mechanism, $15 million related to the impacts of colder
    weather, $10 million favorable result of lower lost gas
    recognized and higher valued gas received as compensation for
    transportation of third party customer gas, $7 million of
    2007 GCR disallowances, and $6 million of appliance repair
    revenue. The 2008 improvement was partially offset by
    $19 million of lower storage services revenue and
    $12 million from customer conservation and lower volumes.
    The increase in 2007 is primarily due to $21 million from
    the favorable effects of weather in 2007 and $28 million
    related to an increase in midstream services including storage
    and transportation, partially offset by a $26 million
    unfavorable impact in lost gas recognized and $7 million in
    GCR disallowances. Revenues include a component for the cost of
    gas sold that is recoverable through the GCR mechanism.

expense increased
    $35 million in 2008 and decreased $2 million in 2007.
    The 2008 increase is primarily attributable to $56 million
    of higher uncollectible expenses, partially offset by
    $14 million of lower corporate support expenses and
    $14 million of reduced pension and retiree health benefit
    costs. The increase in uncollectible expense is partially offset
    by increased revenues from the uncollectible tracking mechanism
    included in the gross margin discussion. The 2007 decrease was
    attributed to $4 million of lower uncollectible expense and
    $4 million of reduced corporate support expenses, partially
    offset by $5 million in increased information systems
    implementation costs.

Other Asset (gains) losses, net

increased
    $23 million in 2008 and $3 million in 2007. Both
    increases are primarily attributable to the sale of base gas.

Outlook —

Higher gas prices and deteriorating
    economic conditions have resulted in continued pressure on
    receivables and working capital requirements that are partially
    mitigated by the MPSC’s GCR and uncollectible

true-up

mechanisms. We will continue to seek opportunities to improve
    productivity, minimize lost gas, remove waste and decrease our
    costs while improving customer satisfaction.

Unfavorable national and regional economic trends have resulted
    in negative customer growth in our service territory and
    increases in our uncollectible accounts receivable. The
    magnitude of these trends will be driven by the impacts of the
    challenges in the domestic automotive industry and the timing
    and level of recovery in the national and regional economies.

The following variables, either individually or in combination,
    could impact our future results:

•

Access to capital markets and capital market conditions and the
    results of other financing efforts which can be affected by
    credit agency ratings;

•

Instability in capital markets which could impact availability
    of short and long-term financing or the potential for loss on
    cash equivalents and investments;

•

Economic conditions within Michigan and corresponding impacts on
    demand for gas and levels of lost or stolen gas;

•

Collectibility of accounts receivable;

•

Increases in future expense and contributions to pension and
    other postretirement plans due to declines in value resulting
    from market conditions;

•

The amount and timing of cost recovery allowed as a result of
    regulatory proceedings, related appeals or new legislation;



•

Our ability to reduce costs and maximize distribution system
    performance;

•

Variations in market prices of gas;

•

Weather;

•

Customer conservation;

•

Volatility in the short-term storage markets which impact
    third-party storage revenues;

•

Extent and timing of any base gas sales;

•

Any potential new federal and state environmental, renewable
    energy and energy efficiency requirements.

NON-UTILITY
    OPERATIONS

Gas
    Midstream

Our Gas Midstream segment consists of our non-utility gas
    pipelines and storage businesses.

Factors impacting income:

Net income increased
    $4 million and $6 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The 2008 increase is due to higher storage
    revenues related to expansion of capacity and higher other
    income primarily driven by higher equity earnings from our
    investments in the Vector and Millennium Pipelines, partially
    offset by a higher tax provision due to the MBT in 2008. Net
    income was higher in 2007 due to higher storage revenues and
    lower expenses due to the Washington 10 restructuring during
    2006.

Outlook

— Our Gas Midstream business expects to
    continue its steady growth plan. In April 2008, an additional
    7 Bcf of storage capacity was placed in service. Future
    additions to storage capacity of approximately 3 Bcf will
    occur over the next few months. Vector Pipeline placed into
    service its Phase 1 expansion for approximately

200 MMcf/d

in November 2007. In addition, Vector Pipeline received FERC
    approval in June 2008 to build one additional compressor
    station, which will expand the Vector Pipeline by approximately

100 MMcf/d,

with a proposed in-service date of November 2009. Adding another
    compressor station will bring the system from its current
    capacity of about 1.2 Bcf/d up to 1.3 Bcf/d in 2009.
    Both the 2007 and 2009 expansion projects are supported by
    customers under long-term contracts. Millennium Pipeline was
    placed in service in December 2008 and currently has nearly 85%
    of its capacity sold to customers under long-term contracts.

Unconventional
    Gas Production

Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural
    gas exploration, development and production within the Barnett
    shale in northern Texas. In June 2007, we sold our Antrim shale
    gas exploration and production business in northern Michigan for
    gross proceeds of $1.262 billion.



In January 2008, we sold a portion of our Barnett shale
    properties for gross proceeds of approximately
    $260 million. The properties sold included 75 Bcf of
    proved reserves on approximately 11,000 net acres in the
    core area of the Barnett shale. We recognized a gain of
    $128 million ($81 million after-tax) on the sale in
    2008.

Factors impacting income:

The 2008 results
    include the gain recognized on the sale of our Barnett shale
    property described above. In addition, lower gas sales volumes
    were offset by higher commodity prices and higher gas and oil
    production from retained wells in 2008 compared to 2007. The
    2007 results reflect the recording of $323 million of
    losses on financial contracts related to expected Antrim gas
    production and sales through 2013.

Operating revenues

increased $276 million in 2008
    and decreased $327 million in 2007. The 2007 decrease
    reflects the recording of $323 million of losses during
    2007 on financial contracts that hedged our price risk exposure
    related to expected Antrim gas production and sales through
    2013. These financial contracts were accounted for as cash flow
    hedges, with changes in estimated fair value of the contracts
    reflected in other comprehensive income. Upon the sale of
    Antrim, the financial contracts no longer qualified as cash flow
    hedges. In conjunction with the Antrim sale, Antrim reclassified
    amounts held in accumulated other comprehensive income, reducing
    operating revenues in the 2007 period by $323 million.
    Excluding the impact of the losses on the Antrim hedges,
    operating revenues decreased $47 million in 2008 as
    compared to 2007. The decreases were principally due to lower
    natural gas sales volumes as a result of our monetization
    initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity prices and
    higher gas and oil production on retained wells.

Other assets (gains) losses, net

increased
    $147 million in 2008 due to the gain on sale of Barnett
    shale core properties offset by $8 million of impairment
    losses primarily related to leases on unproved acreage that
    expire in 2009 that we do not anticipate developing due to
    current economic conditions. The $30 million decrease in
    2007 was primarily due to the recording of impairment losses of
    $27 million in 2007 related to the write-off of unproved
    properties and the expiration of leases in the southern
    expansion area of the Barnett shale.

Outlook —

We plan to continue to develop our
    holdings in the western portion of the Barnett shale and to seek
    opportunities for additional monetization of select properties
    within our Barnett shale holdings, when conditions are
    appropriate. We invested approximately $96 million in the
    Barnett shale in 2008. During 2009, we expect to invest
    approximately $25 million to drill 15 to 25 new wells and
    achieve Barnett shale production of approximately 5 to
    6 Bcfe of natural gas from our remaining properties,
    compared with approximately 5 Bcfe in 2008.

Power
    and Industrial Projects

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects
    that deliver energy and utility-type products and services to
    industrial, commercial and institutional customers; provide coal
    transportation services and marketing; and sell electricity from
    biomass-fired energy projects.



During the third quarter of 2007, we announced plans to sell a
    50% interest in a portfolio of select Power and Industrial
    Projects. As a result, the assets and liabilities of the
    Projects were classified as held for sale at that time and the
    Company ceased recording depreciation and amortization expense
    related to these assets. During the second quarter of 2008, the
    United States asset sale market weakened and challenges in the
    debt market persisted. As a result of these developments, our
    work on this planned monetization was discontinued. As of
    June 30, 2008, the assets and liabilities of the Projects
    were no longer classified as held for sale. Depreciation and
    amortization resumed in June 2008 when the assets were
    reclassified as held and used.

Factors impacting income:

Net income decreased
    $9 million in 2008 and increased $107 million in 2007.

Operating revenues

decreased $257 million in
    2008.  This was primarily attributable to
    $177 million of reductions in coal transportation and
    trading volumes and $28 million for the impact of a
    customer electing to purchase coal directly from the supplier.
    Revenues in 2007 increased $191 million reflecting a new
    long-term utility services contract with a large automotive
    company, higher coke prices and sales volumes in addition to
    higher volumes at several other projects. Additionally, revenue
    was earned for a one-time fee from the sale of an asset we
    operated for a third party. In 2007, revenues were impacted by
    higher synfuel related volumes and increases in trading volumes
    related to both coal and emissions.

Operation and maintenance

expense decreased
    $244 million in 2008 and increased $171 million in
    2007. The 2008 decrease mostly reflects $174 million of
    lower coal transportation costs driven by reduced sales combined
    with a reduction in coal trading results. The 2007 increase was
    due to higher synfuel related production and higher trading
    volumes related to coal and emissions.

Depreciation and amortization

expense decreased
    $7 million in 2008 and $8 million in 2007 due
    primarily to the suspension of $6 million of depreciation
    expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to the assets held
    for sale, the sale of a generation facility during the year and
    reduced depreciation expense as a result of asset impairments at
    several biomass landfill sites in 2006.

Other assets (gains) losses, reserves and impairments, net

expense decreased $6 million in 2008 and decreased
    $76 million in 2007. The 2008 decrease is primarily
    attributable to a loss of approximately $19 million related
    to the valuation adjustment for the cumulative depreciation and
    amortization upon reclassification of certain project assets as
    held and used. Partially offsetting the 2008 loss were gains
    attributable to the sale of one of our coke battery projects
    where the proceeds were dependent on future production. The 2007
    decrease is due to impairments recognized in 2006 at natural
    gas- fired generating plants, long-lived assets at several
    landfill gas recovery sites and fixed assets and patents at our
    waste coal recovery business



Other (income) and deductions

were higher by
    $9 million in 2008 due primarily to higher inter-company
    interest. The 2007 decrease was due primarily to a realized gain
    of $8 million on the sale of a 50 percent equity
    interest in a natural gas-fired generating plant and a
    $4 million gain recognized in 2007 on an installment sale
    of a coke battery facility.

Outlook

— The deterioration in the
    U.S. economy is expected to continue to negatively impact
    our customers in the steel industry and we expect a
    corresponding reduction in demand for metallurgical coke and
    pulverized coal supplied to these customers in 2009. We supply
    onsite energy services to the domestic automotive manufacturers
    who have also been negatively affected by the economic downturn
    and constriction in the capital and credit markets. Our onsite
    energy services are delivered in accordance with the terms of
    long-term contracts which include termination payments in the
    event of plant closures or other events of default and have not
    been significantly impacted by the financial distress
    experienced by the automotive manufacturers. Further plant
    closures, bankruptcies or a federal government mandated
    restructuring program could have a significant impact on the
    results of our onsite energy projects. We continue to monitor
    developments in this sector. In 2009, we expect our coal
    transportation and marketing business to positively contribute
    to the results of this segment as our coal transportation,
    storage and blending services continue to grow. In 2011, our
    existing long-term rail transportation contract which gives us a
    competitive advantage will expire. We will continue to work with
    suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive
    access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers.

Power and Industrial Projects will continue to leverage its
    extensive energy-related operating experience and project
    management capability to develop additional

on-site

energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers
    that are experiencing capital constraints due to the economic
    downturn. We will also continue to look for opportunities to
    acquire

on-site

energy projects and biomass fired generating projects for
    advantageous prices.

Energy
    Trading

Our Energy Trading segment focuses on physical power and gas
    marketing, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from
    DTE Energy’s asset portfolio, optimization of contracted
    natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and power
    transmission and generating capacity positions.

Gross margin

increased $35 million in 2008 and
    decreased $103 million in 2007. The 2008 increase is due to
    higher unrealized margin of $66 million offset by a
    decrease in realized margin of $31 million. The increase in
    unrealized margins includes $18 million in improved gains
    in the gas trading strategy, $26 million gains on economic
    hedges of storage positions due to falling gas prices, and the
    absence of $30 million in mark-to-market losses in June
    2007 reflecting revisions of valuation estimates for natural gas
    contracts, offset by $10 million in losses on economic
    hedges in our gas transportation strategy. The decrease in
    realized



margin is due to unfavorability of $28 million primarily
    from our power marketing and transmission optimization
    strategies, $34 million of unfavorability in our gas
    storage and full requirements strategies due to falling prices
    in 2008, offset by $31 million of improvement in our gas
    trading strategy. The 2007 decrease is attributable to
    approximately $30 million of unrealized losses for gas
    contracts related to revisions of valuation estimates for the
    long-dated portion of our energy contracts and $32 million
    due to absence of unrealized gains on economic storage hedges
    and positions in our full requirements strategy. Timing
    differences from 2005 that largely reversed and favorably
    impacted 2006 margin resulted in $11 million of realized
    unfavorability in 2007. Additionally, margins were unfavorably
    impacted by $13 million of lower realized gains from
    reduced merchant storage capacity in 2007 and $12 million
    of unfavorability in realized power positions.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased
    $10 million in 2008 and decreased $7 million in 2007.
    The 2008 increase is due to higher payroll and incentive costs
    and allocated corporate costs. The 2007 decrease was due
    primarily to lower incentive expenses.

Outlook

— Significant portions of the Energy
    Trading portfolio are economically hedged. The portfolio
    includes financial instruments and gas inventory, as well as
    contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and
    power generation capacity positions. Most financial instruments
    are deemed derivatives, whereas proprietary gas inventory, power
    transmission, pipeline transportation and certain storage assets
    are not derivatives. As a result, we will experience earnings
    volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing
    the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. A source of
    such earnings volatility is associated with the natural gas
    storage cycle, which does not coincide with the calendar year,
    but runs annually from April of one year to March of the next
    year. Our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of
    storage with futures, forwards and swaps. This results in gains
    and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual
    accounting periods.

See Capital Resources and Liquidity and Fair Value sections that
    follow for additional discussion of our trading activities.

CORPORATE &
    OTHER

Corporate & Other includes various holding company
    activities and holds certain non-utility debt and energy-related
    investments.

Factors impacting
    income:

Corporate & Other results
    decreased by $597 million in 2008 and increased by
    $563 million in 2007. This is mostly attributable to the
    2007 gain on the sale of the Antrim shale gas exploration and
    production business for approximately $900 million
    ($580 million after-tax) and variations in inter-company
    interest.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

Synthetic
    Fuel

The Company discontinued the operations of our synthetic fuel
    production facilities as of December 31, 2007. Synfuel
    plants chemically changed coal and waste coal into a synthetic
    fuel as determined under the Internal Revenue Code. Production
    tax credits were provided for the production and sale of solid
    synthetic fuel produced from coal and were available through
    December 31, 2007. The synthetic fuel business generated
    operating losses that were offset by production tax credits.

Factors impacting income:

Synthetic Fuel net
    income decreased $185 million in 2008 and increased
    $157 million in 2007. The decrease in 2008 was due to the
    cessation of operations of our synfuel facilities at
    December 31, 2007 and the final determination of the 2007
    IRS reference price and inflation factor in 2008. The increase
    in 2007 was due to synfuel production occurring throughout the
    year in comparison to 2006 when production was idled at all nine
    of our synfuel facilities from May to October 2006 and higher
    income from oil price hedges, partially offset by a higher
    phase-out of production tax credits due to high oil prices.

Includes intercompany pre-tax gain of $32 million
    ($21 million after-tax) for 2007.

Operating revenues

decreased $1,062 million in 2008
    and increased $206 million in 2007. The 2008 drop is due to
    the cessation of operations of our synfuel facilities at
    December 31, 2007. The 2008 activity reflects the increased
    value of 2007 synfuel production as a result of final
    determination of the IRS Reference Price and inflation factor.
    Synfuel production was higher in 2007 in comparison to 2006 when
    production was idled at all nine of our synfuel facilities from
    May to October 2006.

Operation and maintenance

expense decreased
    $1,256 million in 2008 and increased $246 million in
    2007. The 2008 reduction is due to the cessation of operations
    of our synfuel facilities at December 31, 2007. Activity
    for 2008 reflects adjustments to 2007 contractually defined cost
    sharing mechanisms with suppliers, as determined by applying the
    actual phase-out percentage. The 2007 increase reflects synfuel
    production occurring throughout 2007 in comparison to 2006 when
    production was idled at all nine of our synfuel facilities from
    May to October 2006.

Depreciation and amortization

expense was lower by
    $30 million in 2007 as a result of reductions in asset
    retirement obligations in 2007 and the impairment of fixed
    assets at all nine synfuel projects in 2006.

Asset (gains) and losses, reserves and impairments, net

decreased $249 million in 2008 and increased
    $320 million in 2007. The 2008 decrease was due to the
    cessation of operations of our synfuel facilities at
    December 31, 2007 and reflects the impact of reserve
    adjustments for the final phase-out percentage and

true-ups

of
    final payments and distributions to partners.

The increase in gains in 2007 reflects the annual partner
    payment adjustment, recognition of certain fixed gains that were
    reserved during the comparable 2006 period, higher hedge gains
    and the impact of one-time impairment charges and fixed note
    reserves recorded in 2006. In 2007 and 2006, we deferred gains
    from the sale of the synfuel facilities, including a portion of
    gains related to fixed payments. Due to the increase in oil
    prices, we recorded accruals for contractual partners’
    obligations of $130 million in 2007 and $79 million in
    2006 reflecting the probable refund of amounts equal to our
    partners’ capital contributions or for operating losses
    that would normally be paid by our partners. In 2007, we
    reversed $3 million of other synfuel-related reserves and
    impairments and in 2006 recorded $78 million of other
    synfuel-related reserves and impairments. To economically hedge
    our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices and the
    resulting reduction in synfuel sales proceeds, we entered into
    derivative and other contracts. The derivative contracts are
    marked-to-market with changes in their fair value recorded as an
    adjustment to synfuel gains. We recorded net 2007 synfuel
    hedge mark-to-market gains of $196 million compared with
    net 2006 synfuel hedge mark-to-market gains of
    $60 million.



The following table displays the various pre-tax components that
    comprise the determination of synfuel gains and losses in 2008,
    2007 and 2006.

decreased by $190 million and
    $63 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008
    reduction is due to the cessation of operations of our synfuel
    facilities at December 31, 2007. The 2007 decrease reflects
    the lower net operating losses in 2007 due to the asset
    impairment charge we incurred in 2006, partially offset by an
    increased discount on higher sales levels for 2007.

CUMULATIVE
    EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted
    SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. The
    cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 represented a $4 million increase to
    the January 1, 2008 balance of retained earnings. As
    permitted by FASB Staff Position

FAS 157-2,

we have deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 as
    it pertains to non-financial assets and liabilities to
    January 1, 2009. See also the “Fair Value”
    section.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. (FIN) 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

. The cumulative effect of the adoption of
    FIN 48 represented a $5 million reduction to the
    January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment,

using the
    modified prospective transition method. The cumulative effect of
    the adoption of SFAS 123(R) was an increase in net income
    of $1 million as a result of estimating forfeitures for
    previously granted stock awards and performance shares.

CAPITAL
    RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Cash
    Requirements

We use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas
    utilities and to grow our non-utility businesses, retire and pay
    interest on long-term debt and pay dividends. During 2008, our
    cash requirements were met primarily through operations and from
    our non-utility monetization program.

Our strategic direction anticipates base level capital
    investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2009 of
    up to $1.1 billion. The capital needs of our utilities will
    increase due primarily to environmental related expenditures. We
    incurred environmental expenditures of approximately
    $270 million in 2008 and we expect over $2.9 billion
    of future capital expenditures through 2018 to satisfy both
    existing and proposed new requirements. We plan to seek
    regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within
    our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment.



We expect non-utility capital spending will approximate
    $175 million to $300 million annually for the next
    several years. Capital spending for growth of existing or new
    businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that
    meet our strict risk-return and value creation criteria.

Due to the economy and credit market conditions, we are
    continually reviewing our capital expenditure commitments for
    potential reductions and deferrals and plan to adjust spending
    as appropriate.

Long-term debt maturing or remarketing in 2009 totals
    approximately $350 million.

Cash
    from Operating Activities

A majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our
    electric and gas utilities, which are significantly influenced
    by factors such as weather, electric Customer Choice, regulatory
    deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions and
    operating costs.

Cash from operations totaling $1.6 billion in 2008,
    increased $434 million from the comparable 2007 period. The
    operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects higher net
    income, after adjusting for non-cash and non-operating items
    (depreciation, depletion and amortization, deferred taxes and
    gains on sales of assets), and cash payments received related to
    our synfuel program hedges.



Cash from operations totaling $1.1 billion in 2007
    decreased $331 million from the comparable 2006 period. The
    operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects a decrease in
    net income after adjusting for non-cash items (depreciation,
    depletion and amortization and deferred taxes) and gains on
    sales of businesses. The decrease was mostly driven by taxes
    attributable to our non-utility monetization program.

Cash
    from Investing Activities

Cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily
    generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are
    primarily generated from plant and equipment expenditures. In
    any given year, we will look to realize cash from
    under-performing or non-strategic assets or matured fully valued
    assets. Capital spending within the utility business is
    primarily to maintain our generation and distribution
    infrastructure, comply with environmental regulations and gas
    pipeline replacements. Capital spending within our non-utility
    businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion. The balance
    of non-utility spending is for growth, which we manage very
    carefully. We look to make investments that meet strict criteria
    in terms of strategy, management skills, risks and returns. All
    new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash
    payback on a risk adjusted basis. We have been disciplined in
    how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they
    meet our criteria. For new business lines, we initially invest
    based on research and analysis. We start with a limited
    investment, we evaluate results and either expand or exit the
    business based on those results. In any given year, the amount
    of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash
    flows of the Company with a clear understanding of any potential
    impact on our credit ratings.

Net cash used for investing activities was approximately
    $1.5 billion in 2008, compared with cash from investing
    activities of $330 million in 2007. The change was
    primarily driven by our non-utility monetization program and
    final refund payments to our synfuel partners in 2008.

Net cash from investing activities increased $1.5 billion
    in 2007, due primarily to the sale of our Antrim shale gas
    exploration and production business and lower capital
    expenditures.

Cash
    from Financing Activities

We rely on both short-term borrowing and long-term financing as
    a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied
    by our operations.

Our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed
    and variable interest rates and maturity. We continually
    evaluate our leverage target, which is currently 50% to 52%, to
    ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong
    investment grade debt rating. We have completed a number of
    refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity
    of our long-term debt and strengthening our balance sheet.

Net cash used for financing activities was $84 million in
    2008, compared to net cash used of approximately
    $1.5 billion for the same period in 2007. The change was
    primarily attributable to increased proceeds from the issuance
    of long-term debt, net of debt redemptions and repurchases, and
    lower repurchases of common stock.

Net cash used for financing activities increased
    $1.3 billion in 2007 primarily related to the repurchase of
    common stock, a decrease in short-term borrowings and a lower
    level of long-term debt issuances, partially offset by lower
    debt redemptions.

Outlook

We expect cash flow from operations to increase over the
    long-term primarily due to improvements from higher earnings at
    our utilities. We may be impacted by the delayed collection of
    underrecoveries of our PSCR and GCR costs and electric and gas
    accounts receivable as a result of MPSC orders. Energy prices
    are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working
    capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We are
    continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash
    flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining
    flexibility in the timing and extent of our long-term capital
    projects.



Recent distress in the financial markets has had an adverse
    impact on financial market activities, including extreme
    volatility in security prices and severely diminished liquidity
    and credit availability. Pursuant to the failures of large
    financial institutions, the credit situation rapidly evolved
    into a global crisis resulting in a number of international bank
    failures and declines in various stock indexes, and large
    reductions in the market value of equities and commodities
    worldwide. The crisis has led to increased volatility in the
    markets for both financial and physical assets, as the failures
    of large financial institutions resulted in sharply reduced
    trading volumes and activity. The effects of the credit
    situation will continue to be monitored.

We have experienced difficulties in accessing the commercial
    paper markets for short-term financing needs and an extended
    period of distress in the capital markets could have a negative
    impact on our liquidity in the future. Short-term borrowings,
    principally in the form of commercial paper, provide us with the
    liquidity needed on a daily basis. Our commercial paper program
    is supported by our unsecured credit facilities. Beginning late
    in the third quarter of 2008, access to the commercial paper
    markets was sharply reduced and, as a result, we drew against
    our unsecured credit lines to supplement other sources of funds
    to meet our short-term liquidity needs. We continue to access
    the long-term bond markets as evidenced by certain financings
    completed in the fourth quarter of 2008. Since December 31,
    2008, we have benefited from substantially improved liquidity
    and pricing in the commercial paper market. As a result, we
    anticipate repayment of our credit facility draws during the
    first quarter of 2009.

Approximately $1.2 billion of our total short-term credit
    arrangements of $2.1 billion expire between June and
    December 2009, with the remainder expiring in October 2010. In
    anticipation of a significantly more challenging credit market,
    we expect to pursue the renewal of $975 million of our
    syndicated revolving credit facilities before their expiration
    in October. Given current conditions in the credit markets, we
    anticipate that the new facilities will vary significantly from
    our current facilities with respect to such items as bank
    participation, allocation levels, pricing and covenants. We are
    currently in discussions with our existing bank group and
    actively pursuing potential new candidates for inclusion, as we
    anticipate that a number of banks in our current bank group will
    elect not to participate in the renewal or will alter their
    commitment level. Initial indications are that pricing is likely
    to be significantly higher due to market-wide re-pricing of
    risk. Multi-year agreements are still possible, however, the
    recent trend in the marketplace is toward 364 day
    facilities. Several bi-lateral credit facilities totaling
    approximately $200 million will also expire in 2009 and we
    are evaluating the need for replacement.

Our benefit plans have not experienced any direct significant
    impact on liquidity or counterparty risk due to the turmoil in
    the financial markets. As a result of losses experienced in the
    financial markets, our benefit plan assets experienced negative
    returns for 2008, which will result in increased benefit costs
    and higher contributions in 2009 and future years than in the
    recent past or than originally planned.

We have assessed the implications of these factors on our
    current business and determined that there has not been a
    significant impact to our financial position and results of
    operations in 2008. While the impact of continued market
    volatility and turmoil in the credit markets cannot be
    predicted, we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility,
    cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts
    of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital
    expenditure needs. However, virtually all of our businesses are
    capital intensive, or require access to capital, and the
    inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact
    earnings and cash flows.

    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Credit
    Ratings

Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market
    participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality
    of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities. Management believes that our current credit ratings
    provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However,
    disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically
    related to us may affect our ability to access these funding
    sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors.

As part of the normal course of business, Detroit Edison,
    MichCon and various non-utility subsidiaries of the Company
    routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts
    for the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal,
    capacity, storage and other energy-related products and
    services. Certain of these contracts contain provisions which
    allow the counterparties to request that the Company post cash
    or letters of credit in the event that the credit rating of DTE
    Energy is downgraded below investment grade. Certain of these
    contracts for Detroit Edison and MichCon contain similar
    provisions in the event that the credit rating of the particular
    utility is downgraded below investment grade. The amount of such
    collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon
    commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the
    underlying transactions and could be substantial. Also, upon a
    downgrade below investment grade, we could have restricted
    access to the commercial paper market and if the parent is
    downgraded below investment grade our non-utility businesses,
    especially the Energy Trading and Power and Industrial Projects
    segments, could be required to restrict operations due to a lack
    of available liquidity. While we currently do not anticipate
    such a



downgrade, we cannot predict the outcome of current or future
    credit rating agency reviews. The following table shows our
    credit rating as determined by three nationally recognized
    credit rating agencies. All ratings are considered investment
    grade and affect the value of the related securities.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles require that management
    apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions
    that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and
    liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management
    believes that the areas described below require significant
    judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making
    estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently
    uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional
    discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this Report.

Regulation

A significant portion of our business is subject to regulation.
    Detroit Edison and MichCon currently meet the criteria of
    SFAS No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain
    Types of Regulation

. Application of this standard results in
    differences in the application of generally accepted accounting
    principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses.
    SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of regulatory
    assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have
    been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses.
    Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive
    environment could result in discontinuing the application of
    SFAS No. 71 for some or all of our businesses.
    Management believes that currently available facts support the
    continued application of SFAS No. 71 and that all
    regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable
    in the current rate environment. See Note 5 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

Risk management and trading activities are accounted for in
    accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

as amended
    and interpreted. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting
    and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
    certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and
    for hedging activities. All derivatives are recorded at fair
    value and shown as Derivative Assets or Liabilities in the
    Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Derivatives are
    measured at fair value, and changes in the fair value of the
    derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period
    of change, unless the derivative meets certain defined
    conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge.
    SFAS No. 133 also provides a scope exception for
    contracts that meet the normal purchases and normal sales
    criteria specified in the standard. The normal purchases and
    normal sales exception requires, among other things, physical
    delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a
    reasonable period in the normal course of business. Contracts
    that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not
    recorded at fair value. Essentially all of the commodity
    contracts entered into by Detroit Edison and MichCon meet the
    criteria specified for this exception.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date. The fair
    value of derivative contracts is



determined from a combination of active quotes, published
    indexes and mathematical valuation models. We generally derive
    the pricing for our contracts from active quotes or external
    resources. Actively quoted indexes include exchange-traded
    positions such as the New York Mercantile Exchange and the
    Intercontinental Exchange, and over-the-counter positions for
    which broker quotes are available. For periods in which external
    market data is not readily observable, we estimate value using
    mathematical valuation models. Valuation models require various
    inputs and assumptions, including forward prices, volatility,
    interest rates, and exercise periods. For those inputs which are
    not observable, we use model-based extrapolation, proxy
    techniques or historical analysis to derive the required
    valuation inputs. We periodically update our policy and
    valuation methodologies for changes in market liquidity and
    other assumptions which may impact the estimated fair value of
    our derivative contracts. Liquidity and transparency in energy
    markets where fair value is evidenced by market quotes, current
    market transactions or other observable market information may
    require us to record gains or losses at inception of new
    derivative contracts.

The fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change
    significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new
    information. Actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may
    be different from the results we estimate using models. As fair
    value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity
    prices, we perform sensitivity analysis on the fair values of
    our forward contracts. See sensitivity analysis in the Fair
    Value section. See Notes 15 and 16 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon
    factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers,
    historical trends, economic conditions, age of receivables and
    other information. Higher customer bills due to increased
    electricity and gas prices, the lack of adequate levels of
    assistance for low-income customers and economic conditions have
    also contributed to the increase in past due receivables. As a
    result of these factors, our allowance for doubtful accounts
    increased in 2008 and 2007. We believe the allowance for
    doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates. As part of
    the 2005 gas rate order for MichCon, the MPSC provided for the
    establishment of an uncollectible accounts tracking mechanism
    that partially mitigates the impact associated with MichCon
    uncollectible expenses. Detroit Edison has requested a similar
    tracking mechanism in its rate request filed January 26,
    2009. However, failure to make continued progress in collecting
    our past due receivables in light of volatile energy prices and
    deteriorating economic conditions would unfavorably affect
    operating results and cash flow.

Asset
    Impairments

Goodwill

Certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from
    purchase business combinations. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to
    perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or
    circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be
    impaired. In performing these impairment tests, we estimate the
    reporting unit’s fair value using standard valuation
    techniques, including techniques which use estimates of
    projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the
    reporting unit. Such techniques generally include a terminal
    value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach, which
    incorporates the current market values of comparable entities.
    These cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that
    require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management
    regarding future performance. To the extent projected results or
    cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be
    required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill, which
    would adversely impact our earnings.

As of December 31, 2008, our goodwill totaled
    $2 billion with 97 percent of this amount allocated to
    our utility reporting units. The value of the utility reporting
    units may be significantly impacted by rate orders and the
    regulatory environment.

We performed our annual impairment test on October 1, 2008
    and determined that the estimated fair value of our reporting
    units exceeded their carrying value and no impairment existed.
    During the fourth quarter of 2008, the closing price of DTE
    Energy’s stock declined by approximately 11% and at
    December 31, 2008



was approximately 3 percent below its book value per share.
    The market price of an individual equity security (and therefore
    the market capitalization of an entity with publicly traded
    equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value
    of the entity as a whole. Substantial value may arise from the
    ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that
    flow from control over an entity. An acquirer is often willing
    to pay more for equity securities that give it a controlling
    interest (i.e. a control premium) than an investor would pay for
    a number of equity securities representing less than a
    controlling interest. That control premium may cause the fair
    value of the entity to exceed its market capitalization. In
    assessing whether the recent modest decline in the trading price
    of DTE Energy’s common stock below its book value was an
    indication of impairment, we considered the following factors:
    (1) the relatively short duration and modest decline in the
    trading price of DTE Energy’s common stock; (2) the
    impact of the national and regional recession on DTE
    Energy’s future operating results and anticipated cash
    flows; (3) the favorable results of the recently performed
    annual impairment test and (4) a comparison of book value
    to the traded market price, including the impact of a control
    premium. The implied control premium of approximately
    3 percent needed to equate DTE Energy’s market price
    to its book value was below the low end of the range of control
    premiums observed in recent transactions. As a result of this
    assessment, we determined that the decline in market price did
    not represent a trigger event at December 31, 2008 and an
    updated impairment test was not performed.

We will continue to monitor our estimates and assumptions
    regarding future cash flows. While we believe our assumptions
    are reasonable, actual results may differ from our projections.

Long-Lived
    Assets

We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets,
    excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable.
    Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows
    and fair value of the long-lived assets are deteriorating
    business climate, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of
    the asset before the end of its useful life. The review of
    long-lived assets for impairment requires significant
    assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future
    cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected
    market conditions. An impairment evaluation is based on an
    undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which
    independent cash flows of long-lived assets can be identified
    from other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment may
    occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future
    undiscounted cash flows. When the undiscounted cash flow
    analysis indicates a long-lived asset is not recoverable, the
    amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the
    excess of the long-lived asset over its fair value. An
    impairment would require us to reduce both the long-lived asset
    and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment,
    which would adversely impact our earnings. See Note 4 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this Report.

Our Power and Industrial Projects segment has long-term
    contracts with General Motors Corporation (GM) and Ford Motor
    Company (Ford) to provide onsite energy services at certain of
    their facilities. At December 31, 2008, the book value of
    long-lived assets used in the servicing of these facilities was
    approximately $85 million. In addition, we have an equity
    investment of approximately $40 million in an entity which
    provides similar services to Chrysler LLC (Chrysler). These
    companies are in financial distress, with GM and Chrysler
    recently receiving loans from the U.S. Government to
    provide them with the working capital necessary to continue to
    operate in the short term. We consider the recent announcements
    by these companies as an indication of possible impairment due
    to a significant adverse change in the business climate that
    could affect the value of our long-lived assets as described in
    SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
    of Long-Lived Assets” and have performed an impairment test
    on these assets. Based on our current undiscounted cash flow
    projections we have determined that we do not have an impairment
    as of December 31, 2008. We have also determined that we do
    not have an other than temporary decline in our Chrysler-related
    equity investment as described in APB 18, “The Equity
    Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” As
    the circumstances surrounding the long-term viability of these
    entities are dynamic and uncertain, we continue to monitor
    developments as they occur and will update our impairment
    analyses accordingly.



Pension
    and Postretirement Costs

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement
    benefit plans for substantially all of the employees of the
    Company. The measurement of the plan obligations and cost of
    providing benefits under these plans involve various factors,
    including numerous assumptions and accounting elections. When
    determining the various assumptions that are required, we
    consider historical information as well as future expectations.
    The benefit costs are affected by, among other things, the
    actual rate of return on plan assets, the long-term expected
    return on plan assets, the discount rate applied to benefit
    obligations, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining
    service period of plan participants, level of compensation and
    rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service,
    the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs and the
    level of benefits provided to employees and retirees. Pension
    and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are
    included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects
    within the segments, some of which are capitalized.

We had pension costs for pension plans of $24 million in
    2008, $76 million in 2007, and $134 million in 2006.
    Postretirement benefits costs for all plans were
    $142 million in 2008, $188 million in 2007 and
    $197 million in 2006. Pension and postretirement benefits
    costs for 2008 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial
    assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on
    our plan assets of 8.75%. In developing our expected long-term
    rate of return assumption, we evaluated asset class risk and
    return expectations, as well as inflation assumptions. Projected
    returns are based on broad equity, bond and other markets. Our
    2009 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based
    on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment
    management of 55% in equity markets, 20% in fixed income
    markets, and 25% invested in other assets. Because of market
    volatility, we periodically review our asset allocation and
    rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate. Given
    market conditions, we believe that 8.75% is a reasonable
    long-term rate of return on our plan assets for 2009. We will
    continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our
    expected rate of return, at least annually.

We calculate the expected return on pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected
    return on plan assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan
    assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration
    anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be
    made during the year. SFAS No. 87,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”
    (SFAS 87) and SFAS No. 106,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
    Other Than Pensions” allow the MRV of plan assets to be
    either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes
    in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more
    than five years. For our pension plans, we use a calculated
    value when determining the MRV of the pension plan assets and
    recognize changes in fair value over a three-year period.
    Accordingly, the future value of assets will be impacted as
    previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Volatile
    financial markets contributed to our investment performance
    resulting in unrecognized net losses. As of December 31,
    2008, we had $1.1 billion of cumulative losses that remain
    to be recognized in the calculation of the MRV of pension
    assets. For our postretirement benefit plans, we use fair value
    when determining the MRV of postretirement benefit plan assets,
    therefore all investment losses and gains have been recognized
    in the calculation of MRV for these plans.

The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension
    and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve
    approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two
    highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. The yield
    curve approach matches projected plan pension and postretirement
    benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual
    liability duration unique to our plans. The discount rate
    determined on this basis increased from 6.5% at
    December 31, 2007 to 6.9% at December 31, 2008. Due to
    the combination of recent company contributions, losses on plan
    assets due to negative financial market performance and higher
    discount rates, we estimate that our 2009 total pension costs
    will approximate $57 million compared to $24 million
    in 2008 and our 2009 postretirement benefit costs will
    approximate $208 million compared to $142 million in
    2008. Future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs
    will depend on future investment performance, changes in future
    discount rates and various other factors related to plan design.
    The pension cost tracking mechanism, implemented in November
    2004, that provided for recovery or refunding of pension costs
    above or below amounts reflected in Detroit Edison’s base
    rates, at the request of Detroit Edison was not reauthorized by
    the MPSC in its rate order effective January 1, 2009. In
    April 2005,



the MPSC approved the deferral of the non-capitalized portion of
    MichCon’s negative pension expense. MichCon will record a
    regulatory liability for any negative pension costs, as
    determined under generally accepted accounting principles.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on our plan
    assets by one-percentage-point would have increased our 2008
    pension costs by approximately $39 million. Lowering the
    discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by
    one-percentage-point would have increased our 2008 pension costs
    by approximately $37 million. Lowering the health care cost
    trend assumptions by one-percentage-point would have decreased
    our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2008
    by approximately $26 million.

At December 31, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 158 and
    recognized the underfunded status of our pension and other
    postretirement plans. The impact of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 158 was an increase in pension and
    postretirement benefit liabilities of approximately
    $1.3 billion in 2006. We requested and received agreement
    from the MPSC to record the additional liability amounts for the
    Detroit Edison and MichCon benefit plans on the Statement of
    Financial Position as a regulatory asset. As a result,
    regulatory assets were increased by approximately
    $1.2 billion. The remainder of the increase in pension and
    postretirement benefit liabilities is included in accumulated
    other comprehensive loss, net of tax. In 2008, as required by
    SFAS 158, we changed the measurement date of our pension
    and postretirement benefit plans from November 30 to
    December 31. As a result we recognized adjustments of
    $17 million ($9 million after-tax) and $4 million
    to retained earnings and regulatory liabilities, respectively,
    which represents approximately one month of pension and other
    postretirement benefit cost for the period from December 1,
    2007 to December 31, 2008.

The market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan
    assets has been affected in a negative manner by the financial
    markets. The value of our plan assets was $3.8 billion at
    November 30, 2007 and $2.8 billion at
    December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 our pension
    plans were underfunded by $877 million and our other
    postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by
    $1.4 billion, reflected in noncurrent assets, current
    liabilities, and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The
    decline relative to 2007 funding levels results from negative
    investment performance returns in 2008.

Pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding
    requirements may increase in future years without substantial
    returns in the financial markets. We made contributions to our
    pension plans of $100 million and $150 million in 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Also, we contributed $50 million to
    our pension plans in January 2009. At the discretion of
    management, consistent with the Pension Protection Act of 2006,
    and depending upon financial market conditions, we anticipate
    making up to a $250 million contribution to our pension
    plans in 2009 and up to $1.1 billion over the next five
    years. We made postretirement benefit plan contributions of
    $116 million and $76 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. In January 2009, we contributed $40 million
    to our postretirement benefit plans. We are required by orders
    issued by the MPSC to make postretirement benefit contributions
    at least equal to the amounts included in Detroit Edison’s
    and MichCon’s base rates. As a result, we expect to make up
    to a $130 million contribution to our postretirement plans
    in 2009 and, subject to MPSC funding requirements, up to
    $750 million over the next five years.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
    and Modernization Act was signed into law. This Act provides for
    a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit
    plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially
    equivalent to the benefit established by law. The effects of the
    subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement
    benefit costs reduced costs by $14 million in 2008,
    $16 million in 2007, and $17 million in 2006.

See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Legal
    Reserves

We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and
    litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We
    regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection
    with asserted or potential matters, and establish reserves when
    appropriate. Legal reserves are based upon management’s
    assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and
    claims against us.



Insured
    and Uninsured Risks

Our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for
    various types of risks. Our insurance policies cover risk of
    loss including property damage, general liability, workers’
    compensation, auto liability, and directors’ and
    officers’ liability. Under our risk management policy, we
    self-insure portions of certain risks up to specified limits,
    depending on the type of exposure. The maximum self-insured
    retention for various risks is as follows: property damage -
    $10 million, general liability — $7 million,
    workers’ compensation — $9 million, and auto
    liability — $7 million. We have an actuarially
    determined estimate of our incurred but not reported (IBNR)
    liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for
    self-insured risks as appropriate. As of December 31, 2008,
    this IBNR liability was approximately $39 million.

Accounting
    for Tax Obligations

We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax
    effects of various financial transactions and results of
    operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing
    authorities. We account for uncertain income tax positions using
    a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a
    more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement
    attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of
    tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement in accordance with FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109

. If the benefit does not meet
    the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its
    technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax
    positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included
    on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition
    threshold. We also have non-income tax obligations related to
    property, sales and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing
    appeals related to these tax matters that are outside the scope
    of FIN 48 and accounted for under SFAS No. 5 and
    FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6.

Accounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including
    assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be
    sustained, and estimating reserves for potential adverse
    outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. We also
    assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in
    the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already
    been reflected in the financial statements. We do not record
    valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital
    losses that we believe will be realized in future periods. While
    we believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 are
    appropriately accounted for in accordance with FIN 48,
    SFAS No. 5, SFAS No. 109 and FASB Statement
    of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6, as applicable, the
    ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or
    unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements
    and such adjustments could be material. See Note 8 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this Report.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Environmental investigation and remediation liabilities are
    based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for
    which DTE or its subsidiaries, including Detroit Edison and
    MichCon are responsible, the scope and cost of work to be
    performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared
    with other parties, the time of the remediation work, changes in
    technology, regulations and the requirements of local
    governmental authorities. These matters, if resolved in a manner
    different from the estimates, could have a material effect on
    our results of operation and financial position, to the extent
    the costs are not recovered through the base rates set for our
    utilities. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

FAIR
    VALUE

SFAS No. 157 —
    Fair Value Measurements

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted
    SFAS No. 157.

The cumulative effect
    adjustment upon adoption of SFAS No. 157 represented a
    $4 million increase to the January 1, 2008 balance of
    retained earnings. As permitted by FASB Staff Position

FAS 157-2,

we have deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 as
    it pertains to non-financial assets and liabilities to
    January 1, 2009. See Note 15 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Derivative
    Accounting

The accounting standards for determining whether a contract
    meets the criteria for derivative accounting are numerous and
    complex. Moreover, significant judgment is required to determine
    whether a contract requires derivative accounting, and similar
    contracts can sometimes be accounted for differently. If a
    contract is accounted for as a derivative instrument, it is
    recorded in the financial statements as Derivative assets or
    liabilities, at the fair value of the contract. The recorded
    fair value of the contract is then adjusted at each reporting
    date, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, to reflect
    any change in the fair value of the contract, a practice known
    as mark-to-market (MTM) accounting. Changes in the fair value of
    a designated derivative that is highly effective as a cash flow
    hedge are recorded as a component of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income, net of taxes, until the hedged item
    affects income. These amounts are subsequently reclassified into
    earnings as a component of the value of the forecasted
    transaction, in the same period as the forecasted transaction
    affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the fair value
    changes is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations immediately.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date. The fair
    value of derivative contracts are determined from a combination
    of quoted market prices, published indexes and mathematical
    valuation models. Where possible, we derive the pricing for our
    contracts from active quotes or external resources. Actively
    quoted indexes include exchange-traded positions such as the New
    York Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange, and
    over-the-counter positions for which broker quotes are
    available. For periods or locations in which external market
    data is not readily observable, we estimate value using
    mathematical valuation models. Valuation models require various
    inputs, including forward prices, volatility, interest rates and
    exercise periods. For those inputs which are not observable, we
    use model-based extrapolation, proxy techniques or historical
    analysis to derive the required valuation inputs. We
    periodically update our policy and valuation methodologies for
    changes in market liquidity and other assumptions which may
    impact the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts.
    Liquidity and transparency in energy markets where fair value is
    evidenced by market quotes, current market transactions or other
    observable market information may require us to record gains or
    losses at inception of new derivative contracts. Our credit risk
    and the credit risk of our counterparties is incorporated in the
    valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit
    reserves, the impact of which is immaterial for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments
    include power, gas, certain coal and oil forwards, futures,
    options and swaps, and foreign currency contracts. Items we do
    not generally account for as derivatives include proprietary gas
    inventory, certain gas storage and transportation arrangements,
    and gas and oil reserves.

We manage our MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon the
    delivery period of our contracts and the individual components
    of the risks within each contract. Accordingly, we record and
    manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under our
    contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g.
    electricity or gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery
    during peak or off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by
    region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the
    delivery period (e.g. by month and year).



The subsequent tables contain the following four categories
    represented by their operating characteristics and key risks:

•

Economic Hedges — Represents derivative activity
    associated with assets owned and contracted by DTE Energy,
    including forward sales of gas production and trades associated
    with owned transportation and storage capacity. Changes in the
    value of derivatives in this category economically offset
    changes in the value of underlying non-derivative positions,
    which do not qualify for fair value accounting. The difference
    in accounting treatment of derivatives in this category and the
    underlying non-derivative positions can result in significant
    earnings volatility.

•

Structured Contracts — Represents derivative activity
    transacted by originating substantially hedged positions with
    wholesale energy marketers, producers, end users, utilities,
    retail aggregators and alternative energy suppliers.

•

Proprietary Trading — Represents derivative activity
    transacted with the intent of taking a view, capturing market
    price changes, or putting capital at risk. This activity is
    speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an existing exposure.

•

Other — Primarily represents derivative activity
    associated with our Unconventional Gas reserves. A portion of
    the price risk associated with anticipated production from the
    Barnett natural gas reserves has been mitigated through 2010.
    Changes in the value of the hedges are recorded as Derivative
    assets or liabilities, with an offset in Other comprehensive
    income to the extent that the hedges are deemed effective. The
    amounts shown in the following tables exclude the value of the
    underlying gas reserves including changes therein.

As a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting
    principles, the tables below do not include the expected
    earnings impacts of certain non-derivative gas storage,
    transportation and power contracts. Consequently, gains and
    losses from these positions may not match with the related
    physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting
    periods, resulting in volatility in DTE Energy’s reported

period-by-period

earnings; however, the financial impact of this timing
    difference will reverse at the time of physical delivery

and/or

settlement.

A substantial portion of the Company’s price risk related
    to its Antrim shale gas exploration and production business was
    mitigated by financial contracts that hedged our price risk
    exposure through 2013. The contracts were retained when the
    Antrim business was sold and offsetting financial contracts were
    put into place to effectively settle these positions. The
    contracts will require payments through 2013. These contracts
    represent a significant portion of the above net mark-to-market
    liability.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Price Risk

DTE Energy has commodity price risk in both utility and
    non-utility businesses arising from market price fluctuations.

The Electric and Gas utility businesses have risks in
    conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal, natural gas,
    uranium, electricity, and base metals to meet their service
    obligations. Further, changes in the price of electricity can
    impact the level of exposure of Customer Choice programs and
    uncollectible expenses at the Electric Utility. In addition,
    changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of
    lost gas, storage sales revenue and uncollectible expenses at
    the Gas Utility. However, the Company does not bear significant
    exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in
    regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms. Regulatory rate-recovery
    occurs in the form of PSCR and GCR mechanisms (see Note 1
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
    of this Report) and tracking mechanisms to mitigate some losses
    from customer migration due to electric Customer Choice programs
    and uncollectible accounts receivable at MichCon. The Company is
    exposed to short-term cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of
    the time differential between actual cash settlements and
    regulatory rate recovery.

Our Power and Industrial Projects business segment is subject to
    crude oil, electricity, natural gas, coal and coal-based product
    price risk and other risks associated with the weakened
    U.S. economy including constricted capital and credit
    markets. To the extent that commodity price risk has not been
    mitigated through the use of long-term contracts, we manage this
    exposure using forward energy, capacity and futures contracts.



Our Unconventional Gas Production business segment has exposure
    to natural gas and, to a lesser extent, crude oil price
    fluctuations. These commodity price fluctuations can impact both
    current year earnings and reserve valuations. To manage this
    exposure we may use forward energy and futures contracts.

Our Energy Trading business segment has exposure to electricity,
    natural gas, crude oil, heating oil, and foreign currency price
    fluctuations. These risks are managed by our energy marketing
    and trading operations through the use of forward energy,
    capacity, storage, options and futures contracts, within
    pre-determined risk parameters.

Our Gas Midstream business segment has limited exposure to
    natural gas price fluctuations. The Gas Midstream business unit
    manages its exposure through the sale of long-term storage and
    transportation contracts.

Credit
    Risk

Bankruptcies

We purchase and sell electricity, gas, coal, coke and other
    energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the
    steel, automotive, energy, retail and other industries. Certain
    of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under
    Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We regularly
    review contingent matters relating to these customers and our
    purchase and sale contracts and we record provisions for amounts
    considered at risk of probable loss. We believe our previously
    accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss. The final
    resolution of these matters may have a material effect on our
    financial statements.

Our utilities and certain non-utility businesses provide
    services to the domestic automotive industry, including GM, Ford
    and Chrysler and many of their vendors and suppliers. GM and
    Chrysler have recently received loans from the
    U.S. Government to provide them with the working capital
    necessary to continue to operate in the short term. In February
    2009, GM and Chrysler submitted viability plans to the
    U.S. Government indicating that additional loans were
    necessary to continue operations in the short term. Further
    plant closures, bankruptcies or a federal government mandated
    restructuring program could have a significant impact on our
    results, particularly in our Electric Utility and Power and
    Industrial Projects segments. As the circumstances surrounding
    the viability of these entities are dynamic and uncertain, we
    continue to monitor developments as they occur.

Other

We engage in business with customers that are non-investment
    grade. We closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers
    and, when deemed necessary, we request collateral or guarantees
    from such customers to secure their obligations.

Trading
    Activities

We are exposed to credit risk through trading activities. Credit
    risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading
    counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations. We
    utilize both external and internally



generated credit assessments when determining the credit quality
    of our trading counterparties. The following table displays the
    credit quality of our trading counterparties as of
    December 31, 2008:

Interest
    Rate Risk

DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with
    the issuance of debt and preferred securities. In order to
    manage interest costs, we may use treasury locks and interest
    rate swap agreements. Our exposure to interest rate risk arises
    primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial
    paper rates and London Inter-Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). As of
    December 31, 2008, we had a floating rate debt-to-total
    debt ratio of approximately 12% (excluding securitized debt).

Foreign
    Currency Risk

We have foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price
    fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts. These
    contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily
    for the purchase and sale of power as well as for long-term
    transportation capacity. To limit our exposure to foreign
    currency fluctuations, we have entered into a series of currency
    forward contracts through January 2013. Additionally, we may
    enter into fair value currency hedges to mitigate changes in the
    value of contracts or loans.

Summary
    of Sensitivity Analysis

We performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our
    commodity contracts, long-term debt instruments and foreign
    currency forward contracts. The sensitivity analysis involved
    increasing and decreasing



forward rates at December 31, 2008 by a hypothetical 10%
    and calculating the resulting change in the fair values.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of disclosure controls and procedures

Management of the Company carried out an evaluation, under the
    supervision and with the participation of DTE Energy’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e))

as of December 31, 2008, which is the end of the period
    covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures are
    effective in providing reasonable assurance that information
    required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files
    or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
    include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
    provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
    disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
    under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the inherent
    limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and
    procedures, management cannot provide absolute assurance that
    the objectives of its disclosure controls and procedures will be
    attained.

(b)

Management’s
    report on internal control over financial
    reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    The Company’s internal control system was designed to
    provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management
    and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
    presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
    respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
    Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risks that a control may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, it used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our
    assessment, management believes that, as of December 31,
    2008, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
    that audited the financial statements included in this annual
    report has issued an attestation report on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

Changes
    in internal control over financial reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company:

We have audited the consolidated statements of financial
    position of DTE Energy Company and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows,
    and changes in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive
    income for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These
    financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DTE
    Energy Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
    opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements of the
    Company taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in connection with the required adoption of a new
    accounting standard, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on January 1,
    2007. As discussed in Notes 18 and 19 to the consolidated
    financial statements, in connection with the required adoption
    of new accounting standards, in 2006 the Company changed its
    method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans and share based payments, respectively.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    DTE Energy Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
    of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of
    the Company and our report dated February 27, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedules.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate
    Structure

DTE Energy owns the following businesses:

•

Detroit Edison, an electric utility engaged in the generation,
    purchase, distribution and sale of electric energy to
    approximately 2.2 million customers in southeast Michigan;

•

MichCon, a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase, storage,
    transmission, distribution and sale of natural gas to
    approximately 1.2 million customers throughout
    Michigan; and

•

Our four non-utility segments are involved in 1) gas
    pipelines and storage; 2) unconventional gas exploration,
    development and production; 3) power and industrial
    projects and coal transportation and marketing; and
    4) energy marketing and trading operations.

Detroit Edison and MichCon are regulated by the MPSC. The FERC
    regulates certain activities of Detroit Edison’s business
    as well as various other aspects of businesses under DTE Energy.
    In addition, the Company is regulated by other federal and state
    regulatory agencies including the NRC, the EPA and MDEQ.

References in this report to “Company” or
    “DTE” are to DTE Energy and its subsidiaries,
    collectively.

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared
    using accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. These accounting principles require
    management to use estimates and assumptions that impact reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
    may differ from the Company’s estimates.

Certain prior year balances were reclassified to match the
    current year’s financial statement presentation.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The Company consolidates all majority owned subsidiaries and
    investments in entities in which it has controlling influence.
    Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the
    equity method when the Company is able to influence the
    operating policies of the investee. Non-majority owned
    investments include investments in limited liability companies,
    partnerships or joint ventures. When the Company does not
    influence the operating policies of an investee, the cost method
    is used. These consolidated financial statements also reflect
    the Company’s proportionate interests in certain jointly
    owned utility plant. The Company eliminates all intercompany
    balances and transactions.

For entities that are considered variable interest entities, the
    Company applies the provisions of FIN 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
    Interpretation of ARB No. 51.

We consolidate variable
    interest entities(VIEs) for which we are the primary beneficiary
    in accordance with FIN 46(R). In general, we determine
    whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE through a
    qualitative analysis of risk which indentifies which variable
    interest holder absorbs the majority of the financial risk or
    rewards and variability of the VIE. In performing this analysis,
    we consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including: the
    design and activities of the VIE, the terms of the contracts the
    VIE has entered into, the identification of variable interest
    holders including equity owners, customers, suppliers and debt
    holders and which parties participated significantly in the
    design of the entity. If the qualitative analysis is
    inconclusive, a specific quantitative analysis is performed in
    accordance with FIN 46(R).

Legal entities within the Company’s Power and Industrial
    Projects segments enter into long-term contractual arrangements
    with customers to supply energy-related products or services.
    The entities are designed to pass-through the commodity risk
    associated with these contracts to the customers, with the



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Company retaining operational and customer default risk and
    generally are VIEs. These arrangements are assessed on a
    qualitative and, if necessary, quantitative basis, in accordance
    with the requirements of FIN 46(R) to determine who is the
    primary beneficiary. If the Company is the primary beneficiary,
    the VIE is consolidated. If the Company is not the primary
    beneficiary, the VIE is accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting. The VIEs are reviewed for reconsideration events
    each quarter, and the assessment of the primary beneficiary
    updated, if necessary.

DTE Energy has interests in various unconsolidated trusts that
    were formed for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities
    and lending the gross proceeds to the Company. The sole assets
    of the trusts are debt securities of DTE Energy with terms
    similar to those of the related preferred securities. Payments
    the Company makes are used by the trusts to make cash
    distributions on the preferred securities it has issued. We have
    reviewed these interests in accordance with FIN 46(R) and
    have determined they are VIEs, but the Company is not the
    primary beneficiary.

The maximum risk exposure for consolidated VIEs is reflected on
    our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. For
    non-consolidated VIEs, the maximum risk exposure is generally
    the extent of our investment.

The following table summarizes the amounts for the
    Company’s variable interest entities as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007:

Revenues

Revenues from the sale and delivery of electricity, and the
    sale, delivery and storage of natural gas are recognized as
    services are provided. Detroit Edison and MichCon record
    revenues for electric and gas provided but unbilled at the end
    of each month.

Detroit Edison’s accrued revenues include a component for
    the cost of power sold that is recoverable through the PSCR
    mechanism. MichCon’s accrued revenues include a component
    for the cost of gas sold that is recoverable through the GCR
    mechanism. Annual PSCR and GCR proceedings before the MPSC
    permit Detroit Edison and MichCon to recover prudent and
    reasonable supply costs. Any overcollection or undercollection
    of costs, including interest, will be reflected in future rates.
    See Note 5.

Non-utility businesses recognize revenues as services are
    provided and products are delivered. Trading activities are
    accounted for under the provisions of EITF Issue

No. 02-3,

“Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and
    Risk Management Activites”, which requires revenues and
    energy costs related to energy trading contracts to be presented

Cash
    Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks
    and temporary investments purchased with remaining maturities of
    three months or less. Restricted cash consists of funds held to
    satisfy requirements of certain debt and partnership operating
    agreements. Restricted cash designated for interest and
    principal payments within one year is classified as a current
    asset.

Receivables

Accounts receivable are primarily composed of trade receivables
    and unbilled revenue. Our accounts receivable are stated at net
    realizable value. Customer accounts are written off based upon
    approved regulatory and legislative requirements.

The allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is
    calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates
    developed in reserve studies. We establish an allowance for
    uncollectible accounts based on historical losses and
    management’s assessment of existing economic conditions,
    customer trends, and other factors. Customer accounts are
    generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not
    received by the time the next bill is issued, typically monthly,
    however, factors such as assistance programs may delay
    aggressive action. We assess late payment fees on trade
    receivables based on contractual past-due terms established with
    customers.

For our Energy Trading, non-regulated segment, the customer
    allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on specific
    review of probable future collectibles based on receivable
    balances in excess of 90 days.

Unbilled revenues of $812 million and $843 million are
    included in customer accounts receivable at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Inventories

The Company values fuel inventory, including gas inventory in
    the Energy Trading segment, and materials and supplies at
    average cost.

Gas inventory at MichCon is determined using the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method. At December 31, 2008, the
    replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the
    $14 million LIFO cost by $232 million. During 2008,
    MichCon liquidated 4.2 billion cubic feet of prior
    years’ LIFO layers. The liquidation reduced

2008 cost of gas by approximately $21 million, but had no
    impact on earnings as a result of the GCR mechanism. At
    December 31, 2007, the replacement cost of gas remaining in
    storage exceeded the $32 million LIFO cost by
    $288 million. During 2007, MichCon liquidated
    9.5 billion cubic feet of prior years’ LIFO layers.
    The liquidation reduced 2007 cost of gas by approximately
    $30 million, but had no impact on earnings as a result of
    the GCR mechanism.

Property is stated at cost and includes construction-related
    labor, materials, overheads and an allowance for funds used
    during construction (AFUDC). AFUDC capitalized during 2008 and
    2007 was approximately $50 million and $32 million,
    respectively. The cost of properties retired, less salvage
    value, at Detroit Edison and MichCon is charged to accumulated
    depreciation.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
    when incurred, except for Fermi 2. Approximately
    $25 million and $4 million of expenses related to the
    anticipated Fermi 2 refueling outage scheduled for 2009 were
    accrued at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
    respectively. Amounts are being accrued on a pro-rata basis over
    an

18-month

period that began in November 2007. This accrual of outage costs
    matches the regulatory recovery of these costs in rates set by
    the MPSC.

The Company bases depreciation provisions for utility property
    at Detroit Edison and MichCon on straight-line and
    units-of-production rates approved by the MPSC. The composite
    depreciation rate for Detroit Edison was 3.3% in 2008, 2007 and
    2006. The composite depreciation rate for MichCon was 3.2% in
    2008, 3.1% in 2007 and 2.8% in 2006.

The average estimated useful life for each major class of
    utility property, plant and equipment as of December 31,
    2008 follows:

Estimated Useful Lives in Years

Electric



N/A

Gas

N/A



Non-utility property is depreciated over its estimated useful
    life using straight-line, declining-balance or
    units-of-production methods. The estimated useful lives for
    major classes of non-utility assets and facilities ranges from 5
    to 50 years.

The Company credits depreciation, depletion and amortization
    expense when it establishes regulatory assets for plant-related
    costs such as depreciation or plant-related financing costs. The
    Company charges depreciation, depletion and amortization expense
    when it amortizes these regulatory assets. The Company credits
    interest expense to reflect the accretion income on certain
    regulatory assets.

Intangible assets relating to capitalized software are
    classified as Property, plant and equipment and the related
    amortization is included in Accumulated depreciation and
    depletion on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
    The Company capitalizes the costs associated with computer
    software it develops or obtains for use in its business. The
    Company amortizes intangible assets on a straight-line basis
    over the expected period of benefit, ranging from 3 to
    15 years. Intangible assets amortization expense was
    $54 million in 2008, $42 million in 2007 and
    $37 million in 2006. The gross carrying amount and
    accumulated amortization of intangible assets at
    December 31, 2008 were $576 million and
    $192 million, respectively. The gross carrying amount and
    accumulated amortization of intangible assets at
    December 31, 2007 were $493 million and
    $141 million, respectively. Amortization expense of
    intangible assets is estimated to be $54 million annually
    for 2009 through 2013.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

The Company records asset retirement obligations in accordance
    with SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations

and FIN 47,

Accounting for Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB
    Statement No. 143

. The Company has a legal retirement
    obligation for the decommissioning costs for its Fermi 1 and
    Fermi 2 nuclear plants. To a lesser extent, the Company has
    legal retirement obligations for gas production facilities, gas
    gathering facilities and various other operations. The Company
    has conditional retirement obligations for gas pipeline
    retirement costs and disposal of asbestos at certain of its
    power plants. To a lesser extent, the Company has conditional
    retirement obligations at certain service centers, compressor
    and gate stations, and disposal costs for PCB contained within
    transformers and circuit breakers. The Company recognizes such
    obligations as liabilities at fair market value at the time the
    associated assets are placed in service. Fair value is measured
    using expected future cash outflows discounted at our
    credit-adjusted risk-free rate.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

For the Company’s regulated operations, timing differences
    arise in the expense recognition of legal asset retirement costs
    that the Company is currently recovering in rates. The Company
    defers such differences under SFAS No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation

.

No liability has been recorded with respect to lead-based paint,
    as the quantities of lead-based paint in the Company’s
    facilities are unknown. In addition, there is no incremental
    cost to demolitions of lead-based paint facilities vs.
    non-lead-based paint facilities and no regulations currently
    exist requiring any type of special disposal of items containing
    lead-based paint.

The Ludington Hydroelectric Power Plant (a jointly owned plant)
    has an indeterminate life and no legal obligation currently
    exists to decommission the plant at some future date.
    Substations, manholes and certain other distribution assets
    within Detroit Edison have an indeterminate life. Therefore, no
    liability has been recorded for these assets.

    life of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant.

Unconventional
    Gas Production

The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting
    for investments in gas properties. Under this method of
    accounting, all property acquisition costs and costs of
    exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred,
    pending determination of whether the well has found proved
    reserves. If an exploratory well has not found proved reserves,
    the costs of drilling the well are expensed. The costs of
    development wells are capitalized, whether productive or
    nonproductive. Geological and geophysical costs on exploratory
    prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved
    properties are expensed as incurred. An impairment loss is
    recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved gas properties
    exceed the aggregate related undiscounted future net revenues.
    An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that capitalized
    costs of unproved properties, on a

property-by-property

basis, are considered not to be realizable. Depreciation,
    depletion and amortization of proved gas properties are
    determined using the units-of-production method.

Long-Lived
    Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
    carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the
    carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected future cash
    flows generated by the asset, an impairment loss is recognized
    resulting in the asset being written down to its estimated fair
    value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
    carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Our Power and Industrial Projects segment has long-term
    contracts with General Motors Corporation (GM) and Ford Motor
    Company (Ford) to provide onsite energy services at certain of
    their facilities. At December 31, 2008, the book value of

long-lived

assets used in the servicing of these facilities was
    approximately $85 million. In addition, we have an equity
    investment of approximately $40 million in an entity which
    provides similar services to Chrysler LLC (Chrysler). These
    companies are in financial distress, with GM and Chrysler
    recently receiving loans from the U.S. Government to provide
    them with the working capital necessary to continue to operate
    in the short term. We consider the recent announcements by these
    companies as an indication of possible impairment due to a
    significant adverse change in the business climate that could
    affect the value of our long-lived assets as described in
    SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
    of

Long-Lived

Assets” and have performed an impairment test on these
    assets. Based on our current undiscounted cash flow projections
    we have determined that we do not have an impairment as of
    December 31, 2008. We have also determined that we do not
    have an other than temporary decline in our

Chrysler-related

equity investment as described in APB 18, “The Equity
    Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” We
    will continue to assess these matters in future periods for
    possible asset impairments.

Goodwill

The Company has goodwill resulting from purchase business
    combinations.

The change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the fiscal
    years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 is
    as follows:

We performed our annual impairment test on October 1, 2008
    and determined that the estimated fair value of our reporting
    units exceeded their carrying value and no impairment existed.
    During the fourth quarter of 2008, the closing price of DTE
    Energy’s stock declined by approximately 11% and at
    December 31, 2008 was approximately 3 percent below
    its book value per share. In assessing whether the recent modest
    decline in the trading price of DTE Energy’s common stock
    below its book value was an indication of impairment, we
    considered the following factors: (1) the relatively short
    duration and modest decline in the trading price of DTE
    Energy’s common stock; (2) the anticipated impact of
    the national and regional recession on DTE Energy’s future
    operating results and cash flows; (3) the favorable results
    of the recently performed annual impairment test and (4) a
    comparison of book value to the traded market price, including
    the impact of a control premium. As a result of this assessment,
    we determined that the decline in market price did not represent
    a triggering event at December 31, 2008 requiring an update
    to the October 1, 2008 impairment test. We will continue to
    assess these matters in future periods for possible impairments.

Intangible
    Assets

The Company has certain intangible assets relating to
    non-utility contracts and emission allowances. The Company
    amortizes intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the
    expected period of benefit, ranging from 4 to 30 years.
    Intangible assets amortization expense was $7 million in
    2008, $2 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006. The
    gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible
    assets at December 31, 2008



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

were $85 million and $15 million, respectively. The gross
    carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible
    assets at December 31, 2007 were $31 million and
    $6 million, respectively. Our intangible assets related to
    emission allowances increased to $19 million at
    December 31, 2008 from $9 million at December 31,
    2007. Net intangible assets reclassified to Assets held for sale
    totaled $38 million at December 31, 2007. Amortization
    expense of intangible assets is estimated to be $7 million
    annually for 2009 through 2013.

Excise
    and Sales Taxes

The Company records the billing of excise and sales taxes as a
    receivable with an offsetting payable to the applicable taxing
    authority, with no impact on the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Deferred
    Debt Costs

The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred
    and amortized over the life of each debt issue. In accordance
    with MPSC regulations applicable to the Company’s electric
    and gas utilities, the unamortized discount, premium and expense
    related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized over
    the life of the replacement issue. Discount, premium and expense
    on early redemptions of debt associated with non-utility
    operations are charged to earnings.

Investments
    in Debt and Equity Securities

The Company generally classifies investments in debt and equity
    securities as either trading or available-for-sale and has
    recorded such investments at market value with unrealized gains
    or losses included in earnings or in other comprehensive income
    or loss, respectively. Changes in the fair value of Fermi 2
    nuclear decommissioning investments are recorded as adjustments
    to regulatory assets or liabilities, due to a recovery mechanism
    from customers. The Company’s investments are reviewed for
    impairment each reporting period. If the assessment indicates
    that the impairment is other than temporary, a loss is
    recognized resulting in the investment being written down to its
    estimated fair value. See Note 15.

NOTE 2 —

NEW
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Fair
    Value Accounting

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. SFAS No. 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
    generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. It emphasizes that
    fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
    measurement. Fair value measurement should be determined based
    on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
    an asset or liability. Effective January 1, 2008, the
    Company adopted SFAS No. 157. As permitted by FASB
    Staff Position

FAS No. 157-2,

the Company has elected to defer the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 as it pertains to non-financial assets
    and liabilities to January 1, 2009. The cumulative effect
    adjustment upon adoption of SFAS No. 157 represented a
    $4 million increase to the January 1, 2008 balance of
    retained earnings. See also Note 15.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

. This Statement permits an entity to choose to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value. The fair value option established by
    SFAS No. 159 permits all entities to choose to measure
    eligible items at fair value at specified election dates. An
    entity will report in earnings unrealized gains and losses on
    items, for which the fair value option has been elected, at each
    subsequent reporting date. The fair value option: (a) may
    be applied instrument by instrument, with a few exceptions, such
    as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method;
    (b) is irrevocable (unless a new election date occurs); and
    (c) is applied only to entire instruments and not to
    portions of instruments. SFAS No. 159 is effective as
    of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that
    begins after November 15, 2007. At January 1, 2008,
    the Company elected not to use the fair value option for
    financial assets and liabilities held at that date.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)

157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market
    That is Not Active

. The FSP clarifies the application of
    SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

in an
    inactive market, and provides an illustrative example to
    demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is
    determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive.
    The FSP was effective upon issuance, including prior periods for
    which financial statements have not been issued. The adoption of
    the FSP did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations,

to improve the relevance,
    representational faithfulness and comparability of the
    information that a reporting entity provides in its financial
    reports about a business combination and its effects. To
    accomplish this, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the
    acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction;
    establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement
    objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and
    requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users
    all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the
    nature and financial effect of the business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is applied prospectively to business
    combinations entered into by the Company after January 1,
    2009, with earlier adoption prohibited. The Company will apply
    the requirements of SFAS No. 141(R) to business
    combinations consummated after January 1, 2009.

GAAP Hierarchy

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

This
    statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and
    the framework for selecting the principles used in the
    preparation of financial statements under GAAP.
    SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the
    approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    amendments to AU section 411,

The Meaning of Present
    Fairly



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles

. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 162
    once effective. The adoption is not expected to have a material
    impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Useful
    Life of Intangible Assets

In May 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets.

This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in
    developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine
    the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

. For a recognized intangible asset, an entity shall
    disclose information that enables users to assess the extent to
    which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset
    are affected by the entity’s intent

and/or

ability to renew or extend the arrangement. This FSP is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. The FSP
    will not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Determining
    Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions
    Are Participating Securities

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions are Participating Securities.

This FSP
    addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment
    transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and,
    therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in
    computing earnings per share (EPS) under the two-class method
    described in paragraphs 60 and 61 of
    SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per Share.

Unvested
    share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights
    to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid)
    are participating securities and shall be included in the
    computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. Stock
    awards granted by the Company under its stock-based compensation
    plan qualify as a participating security. This FSP is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim
    periods beginning after December 15, 2008 and will be
    applied retrospectively. Adoption of this FSP is expected to
    result in a reduction of Basic and Diluted EPS of $0.02 and
    $0.01 or less, respectively. See Note 10 for further
    disclosure.

Disclosures
    about Derivative Instruments and Guarantees

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133

. This Statement requires enhanced disclosures
    about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities.
    SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
    November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged.
    Comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption
    are encouraged but not required. The Company will adopt
    SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009.

In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 133-1

and

FIN 45-4,

Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees:
    An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB
    Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective
    Date of FASB Statement No. 161.

This FSP is intended to
    improve disclosures about credit derivatives by requiring more
    information about the potential adverse effects of changes in
    credit risk on the financial position, financial performance,
    and cash flows of the sellers of credit derivatives. This FSP
    also requires additional disclosures about the current status of
    the payment/performance risk of a guarantee. The provisions of
    the FSP that amend SFAS No. 133 and FIN 45 are
    effective for reporting periods ending after November 15,
    2008. The FSP also clarifies that the disclosures required by
    SFAS No. 161 should be provided for any reporting
    period (annual or interim) beginning after November 15,
    2008. The Company has adopted these pronouncements as of
    December 31, 2008. See Note 16 for further disclosures.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an Amendment of ARB No. 51.

This
    Statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 is
    effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
    years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier
    adoption is prohibited. This Statement shall be applied
    prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which
    this Statement is initially applied, except for the presentation
    and disclosure requirements which shall be applied
    retrospectively for all periods presented. The Company will
    adopt SFAS No. 160 as of January 1, 2009.
    Adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have a material
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Offsetting
    Amounts Related to Certain Contracts

In April 2007, the FASB issued FSP

FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39

. This FSP
    permits the Company to offset the fair value of derivative
    instruments with cash collateral received or paid for those
    derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under
    a master netting arrangement. As a result, the Company is
    permitted to record one net asset or liability that represents
    the total net exposure of all derivative positions under a
    master netting arrangement. The decision to offset derivative
    positions under master netting arrangements remains an
    accounting policy choice. The guidance in this FSP is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. It is
    applied retrospectively by adjusting the financial statements
    for all periods presented. The Company adopted FSP

FIN 39-1

as of January 1, 2008. At adoption, the Company chose to
    offset the collateral amounts against the fair value of
    derivative assets and liabilities, reducing both the
    Company’s total assets and total liabilities. The Company
    retrospectively reclassified certain assets and liabilities on
    the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at
    December 31, 2007 as follows:

    $17 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2008,
    amounts not related to unrealized derivative positions totaling
    $7 million and $23 million were included in accounts
    receivable and accounts payable, respectively.

Disclosures
    about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable
    Interest Entities

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)

FAS 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8,

Disclosures about Transfers of
    Financial Assets and Interest in Variable Interest Entities.

The purpose of the FSP is to promptly improve disclosures by
    public entities and enterprises until the pending amendments to
    FASB Statement No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities

, and FASB

Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

, are
    finalized and approved by the Board. Effective for reporting
    periods ending after December 15, 2008, the FSP amends
    Statement 140 to require public entities to provide additional
    disclosures about transfers of financial assets and variable
    interests in qualifying special-purpose entities. It also amends
    FIN 46(R) to require public enterprises to provide
    additional disclosures about their involvement with variable
    interest entities. The adoption of this FSP did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. See Note 1.

Employers’
    Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Assets

On December 30, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (FSP) FAS 132(R)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets.

This FSP amends
    SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003),

Employers’
    Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,

to provide guidance on an employer’s disclosures about
    plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement
    plan. The disclosure requirements required by this FSP are
    effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009.
    The Company will adopt this FSP on December 31, 2009.

NOTE 3 —

DISPOSALS
    AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Sale
    of Antrim Shale Gas Exploration and Production
    Business

In 2007, the Company sold its Antrim shale gas exploration and
    production business (Antrim) for gross proceeds of
    $1.3 billion. The pre-tax gain recognized on this sale
    amounted to $900 million ($580 million after-tax) and
    is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations under
    the line item, “Gain on sale of non-utility business,”
    and included in the Corporate & Other segment. Prior
    to the sale, the operating results of Antrim were reflected in
    the Unconventional Gas Production segment.

The Antrim business is not presented as a discontinued operation
    due to continuation of cash flows related to the sale of a
    portion of Antrim’s natural gas production to Energy
    Trading under the terms of natural gas sales contracts that
    expire in 2010 and 2012. These continuing cash flows, while not
    significant to DTE Energy, are significant to Antrim and
    therefore meet the definition of continuing cash flows as
    described in

EITF 03-13,

Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB
    Statement No. 144 in Determining Whether to Report
    Discontinued Operations

.

Prior to the sale, a substantial portion of the Company’s
    price risk related to expected gas production from its Antrim
    shale business had been hedged through 2013. These financial
    contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges, with changes
    in estimated fair value of the contracts reflected in other
    comprehensive income. Upon the sale of Antrim, the financial
    contracts no longer qualified as cash flow hedges. In
    conjunction with the Antrim sale, the Company reclassified
    amounts held in accumulated other comprehensive income and
    recorded the effective settlements, reducing operating revenues
    in 2007 by $323 million.

Plan
    to Sell Interest in Certain Power and Industrial
    Projects

During the third quarter of 2007, the Company announced its
    plans to sell a 50% interest in a portfolio of select Power and
    Industrial Projects. As a result, the assets and liabilities of
    the Projects were classified as held for sale at that time and
    the Company ceased recording depreciation and amortization
    expense related to these assets. During 2008, the United States
    asset sale market weakened and challenges in the debt market
    persisted. As a result of these developments, the Company’s
    work on this planned monetization was discontinued. As of
    June 30, 2008, the assets and liabilities of the Projects
    were no longer classified as held for sale. Depreciation and
    amortization resumed in June 2008 when the assets were
    reclassified as held and used. During the second quarter of
    2008, the Company recorded a loss of $19 million related to
    the valuation adjustment for the cumulative depreciation and
    amortization not recorded during the held for sale period. The

Sale
    of Interest in Barnett Shale Properties

In 2008, the Company sold a portion of its Barnett shale
    properties for gross proceeds of approximately
    $260 million. As of December 31, 2007, property, plant
    and equipment of approximately $122 million, net of
    approximately $14 million of accumulated depreciation and
    depletion, was classified as held for sale. The Company
    recognized a gain of $128 million ($81 million
    after-tax) on the sale during 2008.

Synthetic
    Fuel Business

The Company discontinued the operations of its synthetic fuel
    production facilities throughout the United States as of
    December 31, 2007. Synfuel plants chemically changed coal
    and waste coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the
    Internal Revenue Code. Production tax credits were provided for
    the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from
    coal and were available through December 31, 2007. The
    synthetic fuel business generated operating losses that were
    substantially offset by production tax credits.

The Company has provided certain guarantees and indemnities in
    conjunction with the sales of interests in its synfuel
    facilities. The guarantees cover potential commercial,
    environmental, oil price and tax-related obligations and will
    survive until 90 days after expiration of all applicable
    statutes of limitations. The

OTHER
    IMPAIRMENTS AND RESTRUCTURING

Other
    Impairments

Barnett
    shale

Our Unconventional Gas Production segment recorded pre-tax
    impairment losses of $8 million and $27 million in
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008 impairment related
    primarily to the write-off of leases that expired or will expire
    within the next twelve months and are not expected to be
    developed under current economic conditions. The 2007 impairment
    consisted of expired leases in Bosque County, which is located
    in the southern expansion area of the Barnett shale in North
    Texas. The properties were impaired due to the lack of economic
    and operating viability of the properties. Impairment losses
    were recorded within the Other asset (gains) and losses,
    reserves, and impairments, net line in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

Landfill
    Gas Recovery

In 2006, the Company’s Power and Industrial Projects
    segment recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of $14 million
    at its landfill gas recovery unit relating to the write down of
    assets at several landfill sites. The fixed assets were impaired
    due to continued operating losses and the oil price-related
    phase-out of production tax credits. The impairment was recorded
    within the Other asset (gains) and losses, reserves and
    impairments, net line in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. The Company calculated the expected undiscounted
    cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the assets,
    which indicated that the carrying amount of certain assets was
    not recoverable. The Company determined the fair value of the
    assets utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Non-Utility
    Power Generation

In 2006, the Power and Industrial Projects segment recorded a
    pre-tax impairment loss totaling $74 million for its
    investments in two natural gas-fired electric generating plants.

A loss of $42 million related to a 100% owned plant is
    recorded within the Other asset (gains) and losses, reserves and
    impairments, net line in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. The generating plant was impaired due to continued
    operating losses and the September 2006 delisting by MISO,
    resulting in the plant no longer providing capacity for the
    power grid. The Company calculated the expected undiscounted
    cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the plant,
    which indicated that the carrying amount of the plant was not
    recoverable. The Company determined the fair value of the plant
    utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.

A loss of $32 million related to a 50% equity interest in a
    gas-fired peaking electric generating plant is recorded within
    the Other (income) and deductions, Other expenses line in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. The investment was
    impaired due to continued operating losses and the expected sale
    of the investment. The Company determined the fair value of the
    plant utilizing a discounted cash flow technique, which
    indicated that the carrying amount of the investment exceeded
    its fair value.

Waste
    Coal Recovery

In 2006, our Power and Industrial Projects segment recorded a
    pre-tax impairment loss of $19 million related to its
    investment in proprietary technology used to refine waste coal.
    The fixed assets at our development operation were impaired due
    to continued operating losses and negative cash flow. In
    addition, the Company impaired all of its patents related to
    waste coal technology. The Company calculated the expected
    undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of
    the assets, which indicated that the carrying amount of the
    assets was not recoverable. The Company determined the fair
    value of the assets utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.
    The impairment loss was recorded within the Other asset (gains)
    and losses, reserves and impairments, net line in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Restructuring
    Costs

In 2005, the Company initiated a company-wide review of its
    operations called the Performance Excellence Process.
    Specifically, the Company began a series of focused improvement
    initiatives within Detroit Edison and MichCon, and associated
    corporate support functions. The Company incurred costs to
    achieve (CTA) restructuring expense for employee severance and
    other costs. Other costs include project management and
    consultant support. In September 2006, the MPSC issued an order
    approving a settlement agreement that allows Detroit Edison and
    MichCon, commencing in 2006, to defer the incremental CTA.
    Further, the order provides for Detroit Edison and MichCon to
    amortize the CTA deferrals over a ten-year period beginning with
    the year subsequent to the year the CTA was deferred. Detroit
    Edison deferred approximately $24 million, $54 million
    and $102 million of CTA in 2008, 2007 and 2006 as a
    regulatory asset. The recovery of these costs was provided for
    by the MPSC in the order approving the settlement in the show
    cause proceeding and in the December 23, 2008 MPSC rate
    order. Amortization of prior year deferred CTA costs amounted to
    $16 million in 2008 and $10 million in 2007. MichCon
    cannot defer CTA costs at this time because a regulatory
    recovery mechanism has not been established by the MPSC. MichCon
    expects to seek a recovery mechanism in its next rate case
    expected to be filed in 2009.

REGULATORY
    MATTERS

Regulation

Detroit Edison and MichCon are subject to the regulatory
    jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to
    rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of
    generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of
    service, accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit
    Edison is also regulated by the FERC with respect to financing
    authorization and wholesale electric activities.

Regulatory
    Assets and Liabilities

Detroit Edison and MichCon apply the provisions of
    SFAS No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain
    Types of Regulation,

to their regulated operations.
    SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of regulatory
    assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have
    been treated as revenue and expense in non-regulated businesses.
    Continued applicability of SFAS No. 71 requires that
    rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing
    regulated services and be charged to and collected from
    customers. Future regulatory changes or changes in the
    competitive environment could result in the Company
    discontinuing the application of SFAS No. 71 for some
    or all of its utility businesses and may require the write-off
    of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no
    longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management
    believes that currently available facts support the continued
    application of SFAS No. 71 to Detroit Edison and
    MichCon.

As noted below, regulatory assets for which costs have been
    incurred have been included (or are expected to be included, for
    costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate
    case) in Detroit Edison or MichCon’s rate base, thereby
    providing a return on invested costs. Certain regulatory assets
    do not result from cash expenditures and therefore do not
    represent investments included in rate base or have offsetting
    liabilities that reduce rate base.

ASSETS

•

Securitized regulatory assets

— The net book
    balance of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant was written off in 1998 and
    an equivalent regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the
    Fermi 2 regulatory asset and certain other regulatory assets
    were securitized pursuant to PA 142 and an MPSC order. A
    non-bypassable securitization bond surcharge recovers the
    securitized regulatory asset over a fourteen-year period ending
    in 2015.

•

Recoverable income taxes related to securitized regulatory
    assets

— Receivable for the recovery of income
    taxes to be paid on the non-bypassable securitization bond
    surcharge. A non-bypassable securitization tax surcharge
    recovers the income tax over a fourteen-year period ending 2015.

•

Recoverable pension and postretirement costs

— In 2007, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 158 which required, among other things, the
    recognition in other comprehensive income of the actuarial gains
    or losses and the prior service costs that arise during the
    period but that are not immediately recognized as components of
    net periodic benefit costs. The Company received approval from
    the MPSC to record the charge related to the additional
    liability as a  regulatory asset since the traditional rate
    setting process allows for the recovery of pension and
    postretirement costs. The asset will reverse as the deferred
    items are recognized as benefit expenses in net income. (1)

•

Asset retirement obligation

— Asset retirement
    obligations were recorded pursuant to adoption of
    SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47. These obligations are
    primarily for Fermi 2 decommissioning costs. The asset captures
    the timing differences between expense recognition and current
    recovery in rates and will reverse over the remaining life of
    the related plant. (1)



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

•

Other recoverable income taxes

— Income taxes
    receivable from Detroit Edison’s customers representing the
    difference in property-related deferred income taxes receivable
    and amounts previously reflected in Detroit Edison’s rates.
    This asset will reverse over the remaining life of the related
    plant. (1)

•

Excess capital expenditures

— PA 141 permits,
    after MPSC authorization, the recovery of and a return on
    capital expenditures that exceed a base level of depreciation
    expense.

•

Deferred Clean Air Act expenditures

— PA 141
    permits, after MPSC authorization, the recovery of and a return
    on Clean Air Act expenditures.

•

Midwest Independent System Operator charges

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization, the
    recovery of and a return on charges from a regional transmission
    operator such as the Midwest Independent System Operator.

•

Electric Customer Choice implementation costs

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization, the
    recovery of and a return on costs incurred associated with the
    implementation of the electric Customer Choice program.

•

Enhanced security costs —

PA 609 of 2002
    permits, after MPSC authorization, the recovery of enhanced
    security costs for an electric generating facility.

•

Unamortized loss on reacquired debt

— The
    unamortized discount, premium and expense related to debt
    redeemed with a refinancing are deferred, amortized and
    recovered over the life of the replacement issue.

•

Deferred environmental costs

— The MPSC
    approved the deferral and recovery of investigation and
    remediation costs associated with Gas Utility’s former MGP
    sites. This asset is offset in working capital by an
    environmental liability reserve. The amortization of the
    regulatory asset is not included in MichCon’s current rates
    because it is offset by the recognition of insurance proceeds.
    MichCon will request recovery of the remaining asset balance in
    future rate filings after the recognition of insurance proceeds
    is complete. (1)

    over-recovery of and a return on gas costs incurred by MichCon
    which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.

•

Refundable costs under PA 141 —

Detroit
    Edison’s 2007 Choice Incentive Mechanism (CIM)
    reconciliation and allocation resulted in the elimination of
    Regulatory Asset Recovery Surcharge (RARS) balances for
    commercial and industrial customers. RARS revenues received in
    2008 that exceed the regulatory asset balances are required to
    be refunded to the affected classes.

•

Refundable income taxes

— Income taxes
    refundable to MichCon’s customers representing the
    difference in property-related deferred income taxes payable and
    amounts recognized pursuant to MPSC authorization.

Deferred income taxes — Michigan Business
    Tax —

In July 2007, the MBT was enacted by the
    State of Michigan. State deferred tax assets were established
    for the Company’s utilities, and offsetting regulatory
    liabilities were recorded as the impacts of the deferred tax
    assets will be reflected in rates.

MPSC
    Show Cause Order

In March 2006, the MPSC issued an order directing Detroit Edison
    to show cause by June 1, 2006 why its rates should not be
    reduced in 2007. Subsequently, Detroit Edison filed its response
    to this order and the MPSC issued an order approving a
    settlement agreement in this proceeding on August 31, 2006.
    The order provided for an annualized rate reduction of
    $53 million for 2006, effective September 5, 2006.
    Beginning January 1, 2007, and continuing until
    April 13, 2008, one year from the filing of the general
    rate case on April 13, 2007, rates were reduced by an
    additional $26 million, for a total reduction of
    $79 million annually. The revenue reduction is net of the
    recovery of the amortization of the costs associated with the
    implementation of the Performance Excellence Process. The
    settlement agreement provided for some level of realignment of
    the existing rate structure by allocating a larger percentage
    share of the rate reduction to the commercial and industrial
    customer classes than to the residential customer classes.



DTE

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

As part of the settlement agreement, a CIM was established
    with a base level of electric choice sales set at 3,400 GWh. The
    CIM prescribes regulatory treatment of changes in non-fuel
    revenue attributed to increases or decreases in electric
    Customer Choice sales. If electric Customer Choice sales exceed
    3,600 GWh, Detroit Edison will be able to recover 90% of its
    reduction in non-fuel revenue from full service customers, up to
    $71 million. If electric Customer Choice sales fall below
    3,200 GWh, Detroit Edison will credit 100% of the increase in
    non-fuel revenue to the unrecovered regulatory asset balance. In
    March 2008, Detroit Edison filed a reconciliation of its CIM for
    the year 2007. Detroit Edison’s annual Electric Choice
    sales for 2007 were 2,239 GWh which was below the base level of
    sales of 3,200 GWh. Accordingly, the Company used the resulting
    additional non-fuel revenue to reduce unrecovered regulatory
    asset balances related to the RARS mechanism. This
    reconciliation did not result in any rate increase.

In November 2008, a settlement was filed in the 2007 CIM
    reconciliation. In the settlement, the parties agreed that the
    Detroit Edison 2007 CIM reconciliation and allocation filing was
    correct. All RARS revenues received in 2008 that exceed the
    regulatory asset balances will be refunded to the affected
    customer classes, and the only remaining classes to be
    reconciled in the RARS reconciliation case are the Residential
    and Special Manufacturing Contract classes. On January 13,
    2009, the MPSC issued an order approving the settlement
    agreement.

    Electric Rate Case Filing

Pursuant to the February 2006 MPSC order in Detroit
    Edison’s rate restructuring case and the August 2006 MPSC
    order in the settlement of the show cause case, Detroit Edison
    filed a general rate case on April 13, 2007 based on a 2006
    historical test year. Supplements and updates were filed on
    August 31, 2007 and February 20, 2008.

On December 23, 2008, the MPSC issued an order in Detroit
    Edison’s February 20, 2008 updated rate case filing.
    The MPSC approved an annual revenue increase of $84 million
    effective January 14, 2009 or 2.0% average increase in
    Detroit Edison’s annual revenue requirement for 2009.
    Included in the approved $84 million increase in revenues
    is a return on equity of 11% on an expected 49% equity and 51%
    debt capital structure.

Other key aspects of the MPSC order include the following:

•

In order to more accurately reflect the actual cost of providing
    service to business customers, the MPSC adopted an immediate 39%
    phase out of the residential rate subsidy, with the remaining
    amount to be eliminated in equal installments over the next five
    years, every October 1.

•

Accepted Detroit Edison’s proposal to reinstate and modify
    the tracking mechanism on Electric Choice sales (CIM) with
    a base level of 1,561 GWh. The modified mechanism will not have
    a cap on the amount recoverable.

•

Accepted Detroit Edison’s proposal to terminate the Pension
    Equalization Mechanism.

•

Approved an annual reconciliation mechanism to track expenses
    associated with restoration costs (storm and non-storm related
    expenses) and line clearance expenses. Annual reconciliations
    will be required using a base expense level of $110 million
    and $51 million, respectively.

•

Approved Detroit Edison’s proposal to recover a return on
    $15 million of costs in working capital associated with
    expenses associated with preparation of an application for a new
    nuclear generation facility at its current Fermi 2 site.

    Electric Rate Case Filing

Detroit Edison filed a general rate case on January 26,
    2009 based on a twelve months ended June 2008 historical test
    year. The filing with the MPSC requested a $378 million, or
    8.1% average increase in Detroit Edison’s annual revenue
    requirement for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010
    projected test year.

The requested $378 million increase in revenues is required
    to recover the increased costs associated with environmental
    compliance, operation and maintenance of the Company’s
    electric distribution system and generation plants, customer
    uncollectible accounts, inflation, the capital costs of plant
    additions and the reduction in territory sales.

In addition, Detroit Edison’s filing made, among other
    requests, the following proposals:

•

Continued progress toward correcting the existing rate structure
    to more accurately reflect the actual cost of providing service
    to business customers;

•

Continued application of an adjustment mechanism to enable the
    Company to address the costs associated with retail electric
    customers migrating to and from Detroit Edison’s full
    service retail electric tariff service;

•

Application of an uncollectible expense

true-up

mechanism based on the $87 million expense level of
    uncollectible expenses that occurred during the 12 month
    period ended June 2008;

•

Continued application of the storm restoration expense recovery
    mechanism and modification to the line clearance expense
    recovery mechanism; and

•

Implementation of a revenue decoupling mechanism.

Cost-Based
    Tariffs for Schools

In January 2009, Detroit Edison filed a required application
    that included two new cost-based tariffs for schools,
    universities and community colleges. The filing is in compliance
    with Public Act 286 which required utilities to file tariffs
    that ensure that eligible educational institutions are charged
    retail electric rates that reflect the actual cost of providing
    service to those customers. In February 2009, an MPSC order
    consolidated this proceeding with the January 26, 2009
    electric rate case filing.

Accounting
    for Costs Related to Enterprise Business Systems

In July 2004, Detroit Edison filed an accounting application
    with the MPSC requesting authority to capitalize and amortize
    costs related to EBS, consisting of computer equipment, software
    and development costs, as well as related training, maintenance
    and overhead costs. In April 2005, the MPSC approved a
    settlement agreement providing for the deferral of certain EBS
    costs, which would otherwise be expensed, as a regulatory asset
    for future rate recovery starting January 1, 2006. At
    December 31, 2008, approximately $26 million of EBS
    costs have been deferred as a regulatory asset. In the
    MPSC’s December 2008 order in the 2007 Detroit Edison rate
    case, the Commission approved the recovery of deferred EBS costs
    over a

10-year

period beginning in January 2009.

Fermi
    2 Enhanced Security Costs Settlement

The Customer Choice and Electricity Reliability Act, as amended
    in 2003, allows for the recovery of reasonable and prudent costs
    of new and enhanced security measures required by state or
    federal law, including providing for reasonable security from an
    act of terrorism. In April 2007, the MPSC approved a settlement
    agreement that authorizes Detroit Edison to recover Fermi 2
    Enhanced Security Costs (ESC) incurred during the period of
    September 11, 2001 through December 31, 2005. The
    settlement defined Detroit Edison’s ESC, discounted back to
    September 11, 2001, as $9.1 million plus carrying
    charges. A total of



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

$13 million, including carrying charges, has been deferred
    as a regulatory asset. Detroit Edison is authorized to
    incorporate into its rates an enhanced security factor over a
    period not to exceed five years. Amortization expense related to
    this regulatory asset was approximately $4 million and
    $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, and
    2007, respectively.

Reconciliation
    of Regulatory Asset Recovery Surcharge

In December 2006, Detroit Edison filed a reconciliation of costs
    underlying its existing RARS. This

true-up

filing was made to maximize the remaining time for recovery of
    significant cost increases prior to expiration of the RARS

5-year

recovery limit under PA 141. Detroit Edison requested a
    reconciliation of the regulatory asset surcharge to ensure
    proper recovery by the end of the

5-year

period of: (1) Clean Air Act Expenditures, (2) Capital
    in Excess of Base Depreciation, (3) MISO Costs and
    (4) the regulatory liability for the 1997 Storm Charge. In
    July 2007, the MPSC approved a negotiated RARS deficiency
    settlement that resulted in a $10 million write-down of
    RARS-related costs in 2007. As discussed above, the CIM in the
    MPSC Show-Cause Order will reduce the regulatory asset.
    Approximately $11 million and $28 million was credited
    to the unrecovered regulatory asset balance during the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The CIM
    expired in April 2008.

Power
    Supply Cost Recovery Proceedings

2005 Plan Year

— In March 2006, Detroit Edison
    filed its 2005 PSCR reconciliation that sought approval for
    recovery of an under-collection of approximately
    $144 million at December 31, 2005 from its commercial
    and industrial customers. In addition to the 2005 PSCR plan year
    reconciliation, the filing included reconciliation for the
    Pension Equalization Mechanism (PEM) for the periods from
    November 24, 2004 through December 31, 2004 and from
    January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005. The PEM
    reconciliation seeks to allocate and refund approximately
    $12 million to customers based on their contributions to
    pension expense during the subject periods. An order was issued
    on May 22, 2007 approving a 2005 PSCR under-collection
    amount of $94 million and the recovery of this amount
    through a surcharge for 12 months beginning in June 2007.
    In addition, the order approved Detroit Edison’s proposed
    PEM reconciliation that was refunded to customers on a
    bills-rendered basis during June 2007. The surcharge will be
    reconciled in the Company’s 2008 PSCR reconciliation.

2006 Plan Year —

In March 2007, Detroit Edison
    filed its 2006 PSCR reconciliation that sought approval for
    recovery of an under-collection of approximately
    $51 million. Included in the 2006 PSCR reconciliation
    filing was the Company’s PEM reconciliation that reflects a
    $21 million over-collection which is subject to refund to
    customers. An MPSC order was issued on April 22, 2008
    approving the 2006 PSCR under-collection amount of
    $51 million and the recovery of this amount as part of the
    2007 PSCR factor. In addition, the order approved Detroit
    Edison’s PEM reconciliation and authorized the Company to
    refund the $22 million over-recovery, including interest,
    to customers in May 2008. The refund will be reconciled in the
    Company’s 2008 PEM reconciliation.

2007 Plan Year —

In September 2006, Detroit
    Edison filed its 2007 PSCR plan case seeking approval of a
    levelized PSCR factor of 6.98 mills per kWh above the amount
    included in base rates for all PSCR customers. The
    Company’s PSCR plan filing included $130 million for
    the recovery of its projected 2006 PSCR under-collection,
    bringing the total requested PSCR factor to 9.73 mills/kWh. The
    Company filed supplemental testimony and briefs in December 2006
    supporting its updated request to include approximately
    $81 million for the recovery of its projected 2006 PSCR
    under-collection. The MPSC issued a temporary order in December
    2006 approving the Company’s request. In addition, Detroit
    Edison was granted the authority to include all PSCR
    over/(under) collections in future PSCR plans, thereby reducing
    the time between refund or recovery of PSCR reconciliation
    amounts. The Company began to collect its 2007 power supply
    costs, including the 2006 rollover amount, through a PSCR factor
    of 8.69 mills/kWh on January 1, 2007. In



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

August 2007, the MPSC approved Detroit Edison’s 2007
    PSCR plan case and authorized the Company to charge a maximum
    power supply cost recovery factor of 8.69 mills/kWh in 2007. The
    Company filed its 2007 PSCR reconciliation case in March 2008
    and updated the filing in December 2008. The updated filing
    requests recovery of a $41 million PSCR under-collection
    through its 2008 PSCR plan. Included in the 2007 PSCR
    reconciliation filing was the Company’s 2007 PEM
    reconciliation that reflects a $21 million over-collection,
    including interest and prior year refunds. The Company expects
    an order in this proceeding in the second quarter of 2009.

2008 Plan Year —

In September 2007, Detroit
    Edison filed its 2008 PSCR plan case seeking approval of a
    levelized PSCR factor of 9.23 mills/kWh above the amount
    included in base rates for all PSCR customers. Also included in
    the filing was a request for approval of the Company’s
    emission compliance strategy which included pre-purchases of
    emission allowances as well as a request for pre-approval of a
    contract for capacity and energy associated with a renewable
    (wind) energy project. On January 31, 2008, Detroit Edison
    filed a revised PSCR plan case seeking approval of a levelized
    PSCR factor of 11.22 mills/kWh above the amount included in base
    rates for all PSCR customers. The revised filing supports a 2008
    power supply expense forecast of $1.4 billion and includes
    $43 million for the recovery of a projected 2007 PSCR
    under-collection. On July 29, 2008, the MPSC issued a
    temporary order approving Detroit Edison’s request to
    increase the PSCR factor to 11.22 mills/kWh. In January 2009,
    the MPSC approved the Company’s 2008 PSCR plan and
    authorized the Company to charge a maximum PSCR factor of 11.22
    mills/kWh for 2008.

2009 Plan Year

— In September 2008, Detroit
    Edison filed its 2009 PSCR plan case seeking approval of a
    levelized PSCR factor of 17.67 mills/kWh above the amount
    included in base rates for residential customers and a levelized
    PSCR factor of 17.29 mills/kWh above the amount included in base
    rates for commercial and industrial customers. The Company is
    supporting a total power supply expense forecast of
    $1.73 billion. The plan also includes approximately
    $69 million for the recovery of its projected 2008 PSCR
    under-collection from all customers and approximately
    $12 million for the refund of its 2005 PSCR reconciliation
    surcharge over-collection to commercial and industrial customers
    only. Also included in the filing is a request for approval of
    the Company’s expense associated with the use of urea in
    the selective catalytic reduction units at Monroe power plant as
    well as a request for approval of a contract for capacity and
    energy associated with a renewable (wind) energy project. The
    Company’s PSCR Plan will allow the Company to recover its
    reasonably and prudently incurred power supply expense
    including, fuel costs, purchased and net interchange power
    costs, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission allowance
    costs, transmission costs and MISO costs. The Company
    self-implemented a PSCR factor of 11.64 mills/kWh above the
    amount included in base rates for residential customers and a
    PSCR factor of 11.22 mills/kWh above the amount included in base
    rates for commercial and industrial customers on bills rendered
    in January 2009. Subsequently, as a result of the
    December 23, 2008 MPSC order in the 2007 Detroit Edison
    Rate case, the Company implemented a PSCR factor of 3.18
    mills/kWh below the amount included in base rates for
    residential customers and a PSCR factor of 3.60 mills/kWh below
    the amount included in base rates for commercial and industrial
    customers for bills rendered effective January 14, 2009.

    MichCon Depreciation Filing

Depreciation Filing —

On June 26, 2007,
    the MPSC issued its final order in the generic hearings on
    depreciation for Michigan electric and gas utilities. The MPSC
    ordered Michigan utilities to file depreciation studies using
    the current method, a FAS 143 approach that considers the
    time value of money and an inflation adjusted method proposed by
    the Company that removes excess escalation. In compliance with
    the MPSC order MichCon filed its ordered depreciation studies on
    November 3, 2008. The various required depreciation studies
    indicate composite depreciation rates from 2.07% to 2.55%. The
    Company has proposed no change to its current composite
    depreciation rate of 2.97%. The Company expects an order in this
    proceeding in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Uncollectible
    Expense

True-Up

Mechanism (UETM) and Report of Safety and Training-Related
    Expenditures

2005 UETM —

In March 2006, MichCon filed an
    application with the MPSC for approval of its UETM for 2005.
    MichCon’s 2005 base rates included $37 million for
    anticipated uncollectible expenses. Actual 2005 uncollectible
    expenses totaled $60 million. The

true-up

mechanism allowed MichCon to recover 90% of uncollectibles that
    exceeded the $37 million base. Under the formula prescribed
    by the MPSC, MichCon recorded an under-recovery of approximately
    $11 million for uncollectible expenses from May 2005 (when
    the mechanism took effect) through the end of 2005. In December
    2006, the MPSC issued an order authorizing MichCon to implement
    the UETM monthly surcharge for service rendered on and after
    January 1, 2007.

As part of the March 2006 application with the MPSC, MichCon
    filed a review of its 2005 annual safety and training-related
    expenditures. MichCon reported that actual safety and
    training-related expenditures for the initial period exceeded
    the pro-rata amounts included in base rates and, based on the
    under-recovered position, recommended no refund at that time. In
    the December 2006 order, the MPSC also approved MichCon’s
    2005 safety and training report. On October 14, 2008, the
    State of Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the appeal of the
    Attorney General of the State of Michigan upholding the right of
    the MPSC to authorize MichCon to charge the 2005 UETM.

2006 UETM —

In March 2007, MichCon filed an
    application with the MPSC for approval of its UETM for 2006
    requesting $33 million of under-recovery plus applicable
    carrying costs of $3 million. The March 2007 application
    included a report of MichCon’s 2006 annual safety and
    training-related expenditures, which showed a $2 million
    over-recovery. In August 2007, MichCon filed revised exhibits
    reflecting an agreement with the MPSC Staff to net the
    $2 million over-recovery and associated interest related to
    the 2006 safety and training-related expenditures against the
    2006 UETM under-recovery. An MPSC order was issued in December
    2007 approving the collection of $33 million requested in
    the August 2007 revised filing. MichCon was authorized to
    implement the new UETM monthly surcharge for service rendered on
    and after January 1, 2008.

2007 UETM

— In March 2008, MichCon filed an
    application with the MPSC for approval of its UETM for 2007
    requesting approximately $34 million consisting of
    $33 million of costs related to 2007 uncollectible expense
    and associated carrying charges and $1 million of
    under-collections for the 2005 UETM. The March 2008 application
    included a report of MichCon’s 2007 annual safety and
    training-related expenses, which showed no refund was necessary
    because actual expenditures exceeded the amount included in base
    rates. An MPSC order was issued in December 2008 approving the
    collection of $34 million requested in the March 2008
    filing. MichCon was authorized to implement the new UETM monthly
    surcharge for service rendered on and after January 1, 2009.

Gas
    Cost Recovery Proceedings

2005-2006

Plan Year —

In June 2006, MichCon filed its GCR
    reconciliation for the

2005-2006

GCR year. The filing supported a total over-recovery, including
    interest through March 2006, of $13 million. MPSC Staff and
    other intervenors filed testimony regarding the reconciliation
    in which they recommended disallowances related to
    MichCon’s implementation of its dollar cost averaging fixed
    price program. In January 2007, MichCon filed testimony
    rebutting these recommendations. In December 2007, the MPSC
    issued an order adopting the adjustments proposed by the MPSC
    Staff, resulting in an $8 million disallowance. Expense
    related to the disallowance was recorded in 2007. The MPSC
    authorized MichCon to roll a net over-recovery, inclusive of
    interest, of $20 million into its

2006-2007

March 2008, the parties reached a settlement agreement that
    allowed for full recovery of MichCon’s GCR costs during the

2006-2007

GCR year. The under-recovery, including interest through March
    2007, agreed to under the settlement is $9 million and was
    included in the

2007-2008

GCR reconciliation. An MPSC order was issued on April 22,
    2008 approving the settlement.

2007-2008

Plan Year / Base Gas Sale Consolidated

—
    In August 2006, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC
    requesting permission to sell base gas that would become
    accessible with storage facilities upgrades. In December 2006,
    MichCon filed its

2007-2008

GCR plan case proposing a maximum GCR factor of $8.49 per Mcf.
    In August 2007, a settlement agreement in this proceeding was
    reached by all intervening parties that provided for a sharing
    with customers of the proceeds from the sale of base gas. In
    addition, the agreement provided for a rate case filing
    moratorium until January 1, 2009, unless certain
    unanticipated changes occur that impact income by more than
    $5 million. The settlement agreement was approved by the
    MPSC in August 2007. Under the settlement terms, MichCon
    delivered 13.4 Bcf of this gas to its customers through
    2007 at a savings to market-priced supplies of approximately
    $41 million. This settlement also provided for MichCon to
    retain the proceeds from the sale of 3.6 Bcf of base gas,
    of which MichCon sold 0.75 Bcf of base gas in 2007 at a
    pre-tax gain of $5 million and 2.84 Bcf in December
    2008 at a pre-tax gain of $22 million. In June 2008,
    MichCon filed its GCR reconciliation for the

2007-2008

GCR year. The filing supported a total under-recovery, including
    interest through March 2008, of $10 million.

2008-2009

Plan Year —

In December 2007, MichCon filed its
    GCR plan case for the

2008-2009

GCR Plan year. MichCon filed for a maximum GCR factor of $8.36
    per Mcf, adjustable by a contingent mechanism. In June 2008,
    MichCon made an informational filing documenting the increase in
    market prices for gas since its December 2007 filing and
    calculating its new maximum factor of $10.76 per Mcf based on
    its contingent mechanism. On August 26, 2008, the MPSC
    approved a partial settlement agreement which includes the
    establishment of a new maximum base GCR factor of $11.36 per Mcf
    that will not be subject to adjustment by contingent GCR factors
    for the remainder of the

2008-2009

GCR plan year. An MPSC order addressing the remaining issues in
    this case is expected in 2009.

2009-2010

Plan Year —

In December 2008, MichCon filed its
    GCR plan case for the

2009-2010

GCR Plan year. MichCon filed for a maximum GCR factor of $8.46
    per Mcf, adjustable by a contingent mechanism. An MPSC order in
    this case is expected in 2009.

2009 Proposed Base Gas Sale

— In July 2008,
    MichCon filed an application with the MPSC requesting permission
    to sell an additional 4 Bcf of base gas that will become
    available for sale as a result of better than expected
    operations at its storage fields. MichCon proposed to sell
    1.3 Bcf of the base gas to GCR customers during the

2009-2010

GCR period at cost and to sell the remaining 2.7 Bcf to
    non-system supply customers in 2009 at market prices. MichCon
    requested that the MPSC treat the proceeds from the sale of the
    2.7 Bcf of base gas to non-system supply customers as a
    one-time increase in MichCon’s net income and not include
    the proceeds in the calculation of MichCon’s revenue
    requirements in future rate cases.

Other

In July 2007, the State of Michigan Court of Appeals published
    its decision with respect to an appeal by Detroit Edison and
    others of certain provisions of a November 2004 MPSC order,
    including reversing the MPSC’s denial of recovery of merger
    control premium costs. In its published decision, the Court of
    Appeals held that Detroit Edison is entitled to recover its
    allocated share of the merger control premium and remanded this
    matter to the MPSC for further proceedings to establish the
    precise amount and timing of this recovery. Detroit Edison has
    filed a supplement to its April 2007 rate case to address the
    recovery of the merger control premium costs. In September 2007,
    the Court of Appeals remanded to the MPSC, for reconsideration,
    the MichCon recovery of merger control premium costs. Other
    parties filed requests for leave to appeal to the Michigan
    Supreme Court from the Court of Appeals decision and in
    September 2008, the Michigan Supreme Court granted the requests
    to address the merger control premium as well as the recovery of
    transmission costs

NOTE 6 —

NUCLEAR
    OPERATIONS

General

Fermi 2, the Company’s nuclear generating plant, began
    commercial operation in 1988. Fermi 2 has a design electrical
    rating (net) of 1,150 MW. This plant represents
    approximately 10% of Detroit Edison’s summer net rated
    capability. The net book balance of the Fermi 2 plant was
    written off at December 31, 1998, and an equivalent
    regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the Fermi 2
    regulatory asset was securitized. Detroit Edison also owns Fermi
    1, a nuclear plant that was shut down in 1972 and is currently
    being decommissioned. The NRC has jurisdiction over the
    licensing and operation of Fermi 2 and the decommissioning of
    Fermi 1.

Property
    Insurance

Detroit Edison maintains several different types of property
    insurance policies specifically for the Fermi 2 plant. These
    policies cover such items as replacement power and property
    damage. The Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) is the
    primary supplier of the insurance policies.

Detroit Edison maintains a policy for extra expenses, including
    replacement power costs necessitated by Fermi 2’s
    unavailability due to an insured event. This policy has a
    12-week waiting period and provides an aggregate
    $490 million of coverage over a three-year period.

Detroit Edison has $500 million in primary coverage and
    $2.25 billion of excess coverage for stabilization,
    decontamination, debris removal, repair

and/or

replacement of property and decommissioning. The combined
    coverage limit for total property damage is $2.75 billion.

In 2007, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005
    (TRIA) was extended through December 31, 2014. A major
    change in the extension is the inclusion of “domestic”
    acts of terrorism in the definition of covered or
    “certified” acts. For multiple terrorism losses caused
    by acts of terrorism not covered under the TRIA occurring within
    one year after the first loss from terrorism, the NEIL policies
    would make available to all insured entities up to
    $3.2 billion, plus any amounts recovered from reinsurance,
    government indemnity, or other sources to cover losses.

Under the NEIL policies, Detroit Edison could be liable for
    maximum assessments of up to approximately $30 million per
    event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear
    plant in the United States should exceed the accumulated funds
    available to NEIL.

Public
    Liability Insurance

As required by federal law, Detroit Edison maintains
    $300 million of public liability insurance for a nuclear
    incident. For liabilities arising from a terrorist act outside
    the scope of TRIA, the policy is subject to one industry
    aggregate limit of $300 million. Further, under the
    Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005, deferred premium charges
    up to $117.5 million could be levied against each licensed
    nuclear facility, but not more than $17.5 million per year
    per facility. Thus, deferred premium charges could be levied
    against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the event
    of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities.

Decommissioning

Detroit Edison has a legal obligation to decommission its
    nuclear power plants following the expiration of their operating
    licenses. This obligation is reflected as an asset retirement
    obligation on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
    Based on the actual or anticipated extended life of the nuclear
    plant, decommissioning expenditures for Fermi 2 are expected to
    be incurred primarily during the period of 2025 through 2050. It
    is estimated that the cost of decommissioning Fermi 2, when its
    license expires in 2025, will be $1.3 billion in 2008
    dollars and $3.4 billion in 2025 dollars, using a 6%
    inflation rate. In 2001, Detroit Edison began the
    decommissioning of Fermi 1, with the goal of removing the
    radioactive material and terminating the Fermi 1 license. The
    decommissioning of Fermi 1 is expected to be completed by 2012.

The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear
    power plants and requires decommissioning funding based upon a
    formula. The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of
    decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of
    external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi 2.
    Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of
    decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level
    radioactive waste. Detroit Edison is continuing to
    fund FERC jurisdictional amounts for decommissioning even
    though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates. The
    Company believes the MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate
    to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning using the NRC
    formula. The decommissioning assets, anticipated earnings
    thereon and future revenues from decommissioning collections
    will be used to decommission Fermi 2. The Company expects the
    liabilities to be reduced to zero at the conclusion of the
    decommissioning activities. If amounts remain in the trust funds
    for Fermi 2 following the completion of the decommissioning
    activities, those amounts will be disbursed based on rulings by
    the MPSC and FERC.

A portion of the funds recovered through the Fermi 2
    decommissioning surcharge and deposited in external trust
    accounts is designated for the removal of non-radioactive assets
    and the

clean-up

of
    the Fermi site. This removal and

clean-up

is
    not considered a legal liability. Therefore, it is not included
    in the asset retirement obligation, but is reflected as the
    nuclear decommissioning regulatory liability.

The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by Detroit Edison.
    Contributions to the Fermi 1 trust are discretionary.

The following table summarizes the fair value of the nuclear
    decommissioning trust fund assets.

    and 1% in cash equivalents. The debt securities had an average
    maturity of approximately 5 years. At December 31,
    2007, investments in the external nuclear decommissioning trust
    funds consisted of approximately 54% in publicly traded equity
    securities, 45% in fixed income and 1% in cash equivalents. The

Securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are
    classified as available-for-sale. As Detroit Edison does not
    have the ability to hold impaired investments for a period of
    time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery of market
    value, all unrealized losses are considered to be other than
    temporary impairments.

Impairment charges for unrealized losses incurred by the Fermi 2
    trust are recognized as a regulatory asset. Detroit Edison
    recognized $92 million and $22 million of unrealized
    losses as regulatory assets for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Since the
    decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by Detroit Edison rather
    than through a regulatory recovery mechanism, there is no
    corresponding regulatory asset treatment. Therefore, impairment
    charges for unrealized losses incurred by the Fermi 1 trust are
    recognized in earnings immediately. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008 no impairment charges were recognized by
    Detroit Edison for unrealized losses incurred by the Fermi 1
    trust. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Detroit Edison
    recognized impairment charges of $0.2 million, for
    unrealized losses incurred by the Fermi 1 trust.

Nuclear
    Fuel Disposal Costs

In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982,
    Detroit Edison has a contract with the U.S. Department of
    Energy (DOE) for the future storage and disposal of spent
    nuclear fuel from Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is obligated to pay
    the DOE a fee of 1 mill per kWh of Fermi 2 electricity generated
    and sold. The fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense. Delays
    have occurred in the DOE’s program for the



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent
    repository. Detroit Edison is a party in the litigation against
    the DOE for both past and future costs associated with the
    DOE’s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the
    timetable set forth in the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
    1982. Detroit Edison currently employs a used nuclear fuel
    storage strategy utilizing a spent fuel pool. We have begun work
    on an

on-site

dry
    cask storage facility which is expected to provide sufficient
    storage capability for the life of the plant as defined by the
    original operating license.

Production tax credits earned in prior years but not utilized
    totaled $224 million and are carried forward indefinitely
    as alternative minimum tax credits. The majority of the
    production tax credits earned, including all of those from our
    synfuel projects, were generated from projects that had received
    a private letter ruling (PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service
    (IRS). These PLRs provide assurance as to the appropriateness of
    using these credits to offset taxable income, however, these tax
    credits are subject to IRS audit and adjustment.

Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over
    the average life of the related property.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    estimated future tax effect of temporary differences between the
    tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts in
    the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are classified as current or noncurrent according to the
    classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred
    tax assets and liabilities not related to assets or liabilities
    are classified according to the expected reversal date of the
    temporary differences. Consistent with rate making treatment,
    deferred taxes are offset in the table below for temporary
    differences which have related regulatory assets and liabilities.

The above table excludes deferred tax liabilities associated
    with unamortized investment tax credits that are shown
    separately on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The Company has state deferred tax assets related to net
    operating loss and credit carry-forwards of $42 million and
    $28 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The state net operating loss and credit
    carry-forwards expire from 2009 through 2029. The Company has
    recorded valuation allowances at December 31, 2008 and 2007
    of approximately $42 million and $28 million,
    respectively, a change of $14 million, with respect to
    these deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of
    deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
    assets will



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets
    is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
    the periods in which those temporary differences become
    deductible. Based upon the level of historical taxable income
    and projections for future taxable income over the periods which
    the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes it
    is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of
    those deductible differences, net of the existing valuation
    allowance as of December 31, 2008.

Uncertain
    Tax Positions

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48,

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48)

on
    January 1, 2007. This interpretation prescribes a
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement
    attribute for the financial statement reporting of tax positions
    taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. As a result of
    the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized a
    $5 million increase in liabilities that was accounted for
    as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained
    earnings.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company has $18 million of unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2008, that, if recognized, would favorably
    impact our effective tax rate. During the next 12 months it
    is reasonably possible that the Company will settle certain
    federal and state tax examinations and audits. Furthermore,
    during the next 12 months, statutes of limitations will
    expire for the Company’s tax returns in various states.
    Therefore, as of December 31, 2008, the Company believes
    that it is reasonably possible that there will be a decrease in
    unrecognized tax benefits of $5 million to $9 million
    within the next twelve months.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties pertaining to
    income taxes in Interest expense and Other expenses,
    respectively, on its Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    Accrued interest pertaining to income taxes totaled
    $8 million and $7 million at December 31, 2008
    and December 31, 2007, respectively. The Company had no
    accrued penalties pertaining to income taxes. The Company
    recognized interest expense related to income taxes of
    $2 million during 2008 and $1 million during 2007.

The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for
    years 2004 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by
    the IRS. The Company’s Michigan Business Tax for the year
    2008 is subject to examination by the State of Michigan. The
    Company also files tax returns in numerous state and local
    jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation.

Michigan
    Business Tax

In July 2007, the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) was enacted by the
    State of Michigan to replace the Michigan Single Business Tax
    (MSBT) effective January 1, 2008. The MBT is comprised of
    an apportioned modified gross receipts tax of 0.8 percent;
    and an apportioned business income tax of 4.95 percent. The
    MBT



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

provides credits for Michigan business investment, compensation,
    and research and development. The MBT is accounted for as an
    income tax.

In 2007, a state deferred tax liability of $224 million was
    recognized by the Company for cumulative differences between
    book and tax assets and liabilities for the consolidated group.
    Effective September 30, 2007, legislation was adopted by
    the State of Michigan creating a deduction for businesses that
    realize an increase in their deferred tax liability due to the
    enactment of the MBT. Therefore, a deferred tax asset of
    $224 million was established related to the future
    deduction. The deduction will be claimed during the period of
    2015 through 2029. The recognition of the enactment of the MBT
    did not have an impact on our income tax provision for 2007.

The 2007 state consolidated deferred tax liability was
    increased in 2008 by $19 million to $243 million to
    reflect changes in federal income tax temporary differences
    primarily due to an approved IRS change in accounting method for
    our utilities for tax year 2007. The related one-time deferred
    tax asset for the tax deduction created for businesses that
    realize an increase in their deferred tax liability due to
    enactment of the MBT was also increased by $19 million to
    $243 million. The deferred tax liabilities of our
    regulatory utilities were increased by $24 million to
    $388 million and the corresponding regulatory assets and
    liabilities were also increased by $24 million to
    $388 million in accordance with SFAS No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation,

as the impacts of the deferred tax liabilities and assets
    recognized upon enactment and amendment of the MBT will be
    reflected in our rates.

In 2008, the state consolidated deferred tax liability increased
    by $25 million to $268 million as of December 31,
    2008 with $20 million of the increase charged to state
    deferred tax expense and $5 million charged to the related
    regulatory assets at the utilities. The regulatory asset at the
    utilities increased to $394 million as of December 31,
    2008.

COMMON
    STOCK

Common
    Stock

The DTE Energy Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase
    of up to $1.55 billion of common stock through 2009.
    Through December 31, 2008, repurchases of approximately
    $725 million of common stock were made.

Under the DTE Energy Company Long-Term Incentive Plan, the
    Company grants non-vested stock awards to key employees,
    primarily management. As a result of a stock award, a settlement
    of an award of performance shares, or by exercise of a
    participant’s stock option, the Company may deliver common
    stock from the Company’s authorized but unissued common
    stock

and/or

from outstanding common stock acquired by or on behalf of the
    Company in the name of the participant. The number of non-vested
    restricted stock awards is included in the number of common
    shares outstanding; however, for purposes of computing basic
    earnings per share, non-vested restricted stock awards are
    excluded.

Dividends

Certain of the Company’s credit facilities contain a
    provision requiring the Company to maintain a ratio of
    consolidated debt to capitalization equal to or less than
    0.65:1, which has the effect of limiting the amount of dividends
    the Company can pay in order to maintain compliance with this
    provision. The effect of this provision as of December 31,
    2008 was to restrict approximately $555 million as payments
    for dividends of total retained earnings of approximately
    $3 billion. There are no other effective limitations with
    respect to the Company’s ability to pay dividends.

EARNINGS
    PER SHARE

The Company reports both basic and diluted earnings per share.
    Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income from
    continuing operations by the weighted average number of common
    shares outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted
    earnings per share assumes the issuance of potentially dilutive
    common shares outstanding during the period and the repurchase
    of common shares that would have occurred with proceeds from the
    assumed issuance. Diluted earnings per share assume the exercise
    of stock options. Non-vested restricted stock awards are
    included in the number of common shares outstanding; however,
    for purposes of computing basic earnings per share, non-vested
    restricted stock awards are excluded. A reconciliation of both
    calculations is presented in the following table:

    computation of diluted earnings per share because the
    options’ exercise price was greater than the average market
    price of the common shares, thus making these options
    anti-dilutive.

Trust Preferred-Linked

Securities

DTE Energy has interests in various unconsolidated trusts that
    were formed for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities
    and lending the gross proceeds to the Company. The sole assets
    of the trusts are debt securities of DTE Energy with terms
    similar to those of the related preferred securities. Payments
    the Company makes are used by the trusts to make cash
    distributions on the preferred securities it has issued.

The Company has the right to extend interest payment periods on
    the debt securities. Should the Company exercise this right, it
    cannot declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or
    acquire, any of its capital stock during the deferral period.

DTE Energy has issued certain guarantees with respect to
    payments on the preferred securities. These guarantees, when
    taken together with the Company’s obligations under the
    debt securities and related indenture, provide full and
    unconditional guarantees of the trusts’ obligations under
    the preferred securities.

Financing costs for these issuances were paid for and deferred
    by DTE Energy. These costs are being amortized using the
    straight-line method over the estimated lives of the related
    securities.

Cross
    Default Provisions

Substantially all of the net utility properties of Detroit
    Edison and MichCon are subject to the lien of mortgages. Should
    Detroit Edison or MichCon fail to timely pay their indebtedness
    under these mortgages, such failure may create cross defaults in
    the indebtedness of DTE Energy.

SHORT-TERM
    CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS

DTE Energy and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Detroit Edison and
    MichCon, have entered into revolving credit facilities with
    similar terms. The five-year credit facilities are with a
    syndicate of banks and may be used for general corporate
    borrowings, but are intended to provide liquidity support for
    each of the companies’ commercial paper programs.
    Borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing
    short-term interest rates. Additionally, at December 31,
    2008, Detroit Edison and MichCon had short-term unsecured bank
    loans of $75 million and $50 million, respectively.
    Also in 2008, DTE Energy entered into two supplemental
    $30 million facilities to support the issuance of letters
    of credit. The above agreements require the Company to maintain
    a debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 0.65 to 1.
    DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon are in compliance with
    this financial covenant. In December 2008, MichCon issued a
    $20 million secured short-term note, due in September 2009.

FAIR
    VALUE

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 157. This Statement defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the
    disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company has
    elected the option to defer the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 as it pertains to non-financial assets
    and liabilities to January 1, 2009.

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that
    would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous
    market. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is
    determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions
    that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities.
    These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or
    generally unobservable inputs. The Company makes certain
    assumptions it believes that market participants would use in
    pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk,
    and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques.
    Credit risk of the Company and its counterparties is
    incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through
    the use of credit reserves, the impact of which is immaterial
    for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company believes
    it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
    market-based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which
    prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
    fair value in three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives
    the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
    inputs (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure
    fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value
    hierarchy. SFAS No. 157 requires that assets and
    liabilities be classified in their entirety based on the lowest
    level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement
    in its entirety. Assessing the significance of a particular
    input may require judgment considering factors specific to the
    asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the asset or
    liability and its placement within the fair value hierarchy. The
    Company classifies fair value balances based on the fair value
    hierarchy defined by SFAS No. 157 as follows:

•

Level 1 — Consists of unadjusted quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
    Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date.

•

Level 2 — Consists of inputs other than quoted
    prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable
    for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through
    corroboration with observable market data.

•

Level 3 — Consists of unobservable inputs for
    assets or liabilities whose fair value is estimated based on
    internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that
    are generally less readily observable and supported by little,
    if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable
    inputs are developed based on the best available information and
    subject to cost-benefit constraints.

Balance as of January 1, 2008 includes a cumulative effect
    adjustment which represents an increase to beginning retained
    earnings related to Level 3 derivatives upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 157.

Net losses of $10 million related to Level 3
    derivative assets and liabilities are reported in Operating
    Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 consistent
    with the Company’s accounting policy. Net gains of
    $154 million related to Level 1 and Level 2
    derivative assets and liabilities, and the impact of netting,
    are also reported in Operating Revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Transfers in/out of Level 3
    represent existing assets or liabilities that were either
    previously categorized as a higher level for which the inputs to
    the model became unobservable or assets and liabilities that
    were previously classified as Level 3 for



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

which the lowest significant input became observable during the
    period. Transfers in/out of Level 3 are reflected as if
    they had occurred at the beginning of the period.

SFAS No. 157 provides for limited retrospective
    application, the net of which is recorded as an adjustment to
    beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption. As a
    result, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of
    $4 million, net of taxes, as an increase to beginning
    retained earnings as of January 1, 2008.

Cash
    Equivalents

Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three
    months or less when purchased. The cash equivalents shown in the
    fair value table are comprised of investments in money market
    funds. The fair values of the shares of these funds are based on
    observable market prices and, therefore, have been categorized
    as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Trusts and Other Investments

The nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments have been
    established to satisfy Detroit Edison’s nuclear
    decommissioning obligations. The nuclear decommissioning trusts
    and other fund investments hold debt and equity securities
    directly and indirectly through commingled funds and
    institutional mutual funds. Exchange-traded debt and equity
    securities held directly are valued using quoted market prices
    on actively traded markets. The commingled funds and
    institutional mutual funds which hold exchange-traded equity or
    debt securities are valued using quoted prices in actively
    traded markets. Non-exchange-traded fixed income securities are
    valued based upon quotations available from brokers or pricing
    services. For non-exchange traded fixed income securities, the
    trustees receive prices from pricing services. A primary price
    source is identified by asset type, class or issue for each
    security. The trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing
    services and may use a supplemental price source or change the
    primary price source of a given security if the trustees
    challenge an assigned price and determine that another price
    source is considered to be preferable. DTE Energy has obtained
    an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the
    nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such
    prices. Additionally, DTE Energy selectively corroborates the
    fair values of securities by comparison of market-based price
    sources.

Derivative
    Assets and Liabilities

Derivative assets and liabilities are comprised of physical and
    financial derivative contracts, including futures, forwards,
    options and swaps that are both exchange-traded and
    over-the-counter traded contracts. Various inputs are used to
    value derivatives depending on the type of contract and
    availability of market data. Exchange-traded derivative
    contracts are valued using quoted prices in active markets.
    Other derivative contracts are valued based upon a variety of
    inputs including commodity market prices, interest rates, credit
    ratings, default rates, market-based seasonality and basis
    differential factors. Mathematical valuation models are used for
    derivatives for which external market data is not readily
    observable, such as contracts which extend beyond the actively
    traded reporting period. Derivative instruments are principally
    used in the Company’s Energy Trading segment.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments is determined by using
    various market data and other valuation techniques. The table
    below shows the fair value relative to the carrying value for
    long-term debt securities. The carrying value of certain other
    financial instruments, such as notes payable, customer deposits
    and notes receivable approximate fair value and are not shown as
    carrying value approximates fair value. As of December 31,
    2008, the Company had approximately $747 million of tax
    exempt securities and $120 million of taxable securities
    insured by insurers. Overall credit market conditions have
    resulted in credit rating

downgrades and may result in future credit rating downgrades for

FINANCIAL
    AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Company complies with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as
    amended and interpreted. Under SFAS No. 133, all
    derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Statement of
    Financial Position at their fair value unless they qualify for
    certain scope exceptions, including normal purchases and normal
    sales exception. Further, derivatives that qualify and are
    designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges
    of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to
    be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability
    (cash flow hedge), or as hedges of the fair value of a
    recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm
    commitment (fair value hedge). For cash flow hedges, the portion
    of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting
    the change in the value of the underlying exposure is deferred
    in Accumulated other comprehensive income and later reclassified
    into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. For fair
    value hedges, changes in fair values for both the derivative and
    the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each
    period. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any
    hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. For derivatives
    that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting,
    changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings each period.

The Company’s primary market risk exposure is associated
    with commodity prices, credit, interest rates and foreign
    currency. The Company has risk management policies to monitor
    and decrease market risks. The Company uses derivative
    instruments to manage some of the exposure. The Company uses
    derivative instruments for trading purposes in its Energy
    Trading segment and the coal marketing activities of its Power
    and Industrial Projects segment. The fair value of all
    derivatives is included in Derivative assets or liabilities on
    the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Commodity
    Price Risk and Foreign Currency Risk

Utility
    Operations

Detroit Edison

— Detroit Edison generates,
    purchases, distributes and sells electricity. Detroit Edison
    uses forward energy and capacity contracts to manage changes in
    the price of electricity and fuel. Contracts that are
    derivatives and meet the normal purchases and sales exemption
    are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative
    contracts are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism when
    realized. This results in the deferral of unrealized gains and
    losses or regulatory assets or liabilities, until realized.

MichCon

— MichCon purchases, stores, transmits
    and distributes natural gas and sells storage and transportation
    capacity. MichCon has fixed-priced contracts for portions of its
    expected gas supply requirements through 2012. These gas-supply
    contracts are designated and qualify for the normal purchases
    and sales exemption and are therefore accounted for under the
    accrual method. MichCon may also sell forward storage and
    transportation capacity contracts. Forward firm transportation
    and storage contracts are not derivatives and are therefore
    accounted for under the accrual method.

Non-Utility
    Operations

Power and Industrial Projects

— These business
    segments manage and operate

on-site

energy and steel related projects, coke batteries, landfill gas
    recovery and power generation assets. These businesses utilize
    fixed-priced contracts in the marketing and management of their
    assets. These contracts are generally not derivatives and are
    therefore accounted for under the accrual method. The business
    unit also engages in coal

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

marketing which includes the marketing and trading of physical
    coal and coal financial instruments, and forward contracts for
    the purchase and sale of emissions allowances. Certain of the
    physical coal contracts meet the normal purchase and sales
    exemption and are accounted for using the accrual method.
    Financial and other physical coal contracts are derivatives and
    are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings.

Unconventional Gas Production

— The
    Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in
    unconventional gas project development and production. The
    Company uses derivative contracts to manage changes in the price
    of natural gas. These derivatives are designated as cash flow
    hedges. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income/ (loss)
    will be reclassified to earnings, as the related production
    affects earnings through 2010. In 2008 and 2007,
    $0.5 million of after-tax gains and $222 million of
    after-tax losses, respectively, were reclassified to earnings.
    The 2007 amounts principally related to the sale of the Antrim
    business. See Note 3 for further discussion of the
    discontinuance of a portion of cash flow hedge accounting upon
    sale of the Antrim business. In 2009, management estimates
    reclassifying an after-tax gain of approximately $3 million
    to earnings.

Energy Trading — Commodity Price Risk —

Energy Trading markets and trades wholesale electricity and
    natural gas physical products and energy financial instruments,
    and provides risk management services utilizing energy commodity
    derivative instruments. Forwards, futures, options and swap
    agreements are used to manage exposure to the risk of market
    price and volume fluctuations in its operations. These
    derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value
    to earnings, unless certain hedge accounting criteria are met.

Energy Trading — Foreign Currency Risk —

Energy Trading has foreign currency forward contracts to
    economically hedge fixed Canadian dollar commitments existing
    under power purchase and sale contracts and gas transportation
    contracts. The Company entered into these contracts to mitigate
    price volatility with respect to fluctuations of the Canadian
    dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Certain of these
    contracts were previously designated as cash flow hedges.
    Amounts were recorded to Other comprehensive income and
    reclassified to Operating revenues or Fuel, purchased power and
    gas expense when the related hedged item impacted earnings.

In 2008 and 2007, $1 million and $7 million,
    respectively, of after-tax losses were reclassified to earnings.
    The foreign currency hedge has been fully realized as of
    December 31, 2008 and therefore, no further earnings impact
    is expected.

Gas Midstream —

These business units are
    primarily engaged in services related to the transportation,
    processing and storage of natural gas. These businesses utilize
    fixed-priced contracts in their marketing and management of
    their businesses. Generally these contracts are not derivatives
    and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.

Credit
    Risk

The utility and non-utility businesses are exposed to credit
    risk if customers or counterparties do not comply with their
    contractual obligations. The Company maintains credit policies
    that significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies
    include an evaluation of potential customers’ and
    counterparties’ financial condition, credit rating,
    collateral requirements or other credit enhancements such as
    letters of credit or guarantees. The Company generally uses
    standardized agreements that allow the netting of positive and
    negative transactions associated with a single counterparty.

The Company maintains a provision for credit losses based on
    factors surrounding the credit risk of its customers, historical
    trends, and other information. Based on the Company’s
    credit policies and its December 31, 2008 provision for
    credit losses, the Company’s exposure to counterparty
    nonperformance is not expected to result in material effects on
    the Company’s financial statements.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Interest
    Rate Risk

The Company uses interest rate swaps, treasury locks and other
    derivatives to hedge the risk associated with interest rate
    market volatility. In 2004 and 2000, the Company entered into a
    series of interest rate derivatives to limit its sensitivity to
    market interest rate risk associated with the issuance of
    long-term debt. Such instruments were designated as cash flow
    hedges. The Company subsequently issued long-term debt and
    terminated these hedges at a cost that is included in other
    comprehensive loss. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss
    will be reclassified to Interest expense as the related interest
    affects earnings through 2033. In 2009, the Company estimates
    reclassifying $4 million of losses to earnings.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

Electric
    Utility

Air

— Detroit Edison is subject to EPA ozone
    transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant
    emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Since 2005, EPA
    and the State of Michigan have issued additional emission
    reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate,
    regional haze and mercury air pollution. The new rules will lead
    to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
    nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. To comply
    with these requirements, Detroit Edison has spent approximately
    $1.4 billion through 2008. The Company estimates Detroit
    Edison future undiscounted capital expenditures at up to
    $100 million in 2009 and up to $2.8 billion of
    additional capital expenditures through 2018 based on current
    regulations.

Water

— In response to an EPA regulation,
    Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing
    the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures
    at several of its facilities. Based on the results of the
    studies to be conducted over the next several years, Detroit
    Edison may be required to install additional control
    technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intakes.
    Initially, it was estimated that Detroit Edison could incur up
    to approximately $55 million over the four to six years
    subsequent to 2008 in additional capital expenditures to comply
    with these requirements. However, a January 2007 circuit court
    decision remanded back to the EPA several provisions of the
    federal regulation that may result in a delay in compliance
    dates. The decision also raised the possibility that Detroit
    Edison may have to install cooling towers at some facilities at
    a cost substantially greater than was initially estimated for
    other mitigative technologies. In 2008, the Supreme Court agreed
    to review the remanded cost-benefit analysis provision of the
    rule. A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2009.
    Concurrently, the EPA continues to develop a revised rule, which
    is expected to be published in early 2009.

Contaminated Sites

— Detroit Edison conducted
    remedial investigations at contaminated sites, including three
    former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites, the area surrounding
    an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage
    tank locations. The findings of these investigations indicated
    that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is expected to
    be incurred over the next several years. At December 31,
    2008 and 2007, the Company had $12 million and
    $15 million, respectively, accrued for remediation.

Gas
    Utility

Contaminated Sites

— Prior to the construction
    of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and
    other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving
    coal, coke or oil. Gas Utility owns, or previously owned, 15
    such former MGP sites. Investigations have revealed
    contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at
    each site. In addition to the MGP sites, the Company is also in
    the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites. Cleanup
    activities associated with these sites will be conducted over
    the next several years.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery
    mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at
    former MGP sites. Accordingly, Gas Utility recognizes a
    liability and corresponding regulatory asset for estimated
    investigation and remediation costs at former MGP sites. During
    2008, the Company spent approximately $2 million
    investigating and remediating these former MGP sites. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had
    $38 million and $40 million, respectively, accrued for
    remediation.

Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation
    techniques, nature and extent of contamination and regulatory
    requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs
    for the sites and affect the Company’s financial position
    and cash flows. However, the Company anticipates the cost
    deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the MPSC will
    prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse
    impact on our results of operations.

Non-Utility

The Company’s non-utility affiliates are subject to a
    number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the
    protection of the environment from various pollutants. The
    Company is in the process of installing new environmental
    equipment at our coke battery facility in Michigan. The Company
    expects the projects to be completed by the first half of 2009.
    The Michigan coke battery facility received and responded to
    information requests from the EPA resulting in the issuance of a
    notice of violation regarding potential maximum achievable
    control technologies and new source review violations. The EPA
    is in the process of reviewing the Company’s position of
    demonstrated compliance and has not initiated escalated
    enforcement. At this time, the Company cannot predict the impact
    of this issue. Furthermore, the Company is in the process of
    settling historical air violations at its coke battery facility
    located in Pennsylvania. At this time, we cannot predict the
    impact of this settlement. The Company is investigating
    wastewater treatment technologies for the coke battery facility
    located in Pennsylvania. This investigation may result in
    capital expenditures to meet regulatory requirements. The
    Company’s non-utility affiliates are substantially in
    compliance with all environmental requirements, other than as
    noted above.

Guarantees

In certain limited circumstances, the Company enters into
    contractual guarantees. The Company may guarantee another
    entity’s obligation in the event it fails to perform. The
    Company may provide guarantees in certain indemnification
    agreements. Finally, the Company may provide indirect guarantees
    for the indebtedness of others. Below are the details of
    specific material guarantees the Company currently provides.

Millennium
    Pipeline Project Guarantee

The Company owns a 26% equity interest in the Millennium
    Pipeline Project (Millennium). Millennium is accounted for under
    the equity method. Millennium began commercial operations in
    December 2008.

On August 29, 2007, Millennium entered into a borrowing
    facility to finance the construction costs of the project. The
    total facility amounts to $800 million and is guaranteed by
    the project partners, based upon their respective ownership
    percentages. The facility expires on August 29, 2010 and
    was fully drawn as of December 31, 2008. Proceeds of the
    facility are being used to fund project costs and expenses
    relating to the development, construction and commercial start
    up and testing of the pipeline project and for general corporate
    purposes. In addition, the facility has been utilized to
    reimburse the project partners for costs and expenses incurred
    in connection with the project for the period subsequent to
    June 1, 2004 through immediately prior to the closing of
    the facility. The Company received approximately
    $23.5 million in September 2007 as reimbursement for costs
    and expenses incurred by it during the above-mentioned period.
    The Company accounted for this reimbursement as a return of
    capital.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Company has agreed to guarantee 26% of the borrowing
    facility and in the event of default by Millennium the maximum
    potential amount of future payments under this guarantee is
    approximately $210 million. The guarantee includes DTE
    Energy’s revolving credit facility’s covenant and
    default provisions by reference. Related to this facility, the
    Company has also agreed to guarantee 26% of Millennium’s
    forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of
    $420 million. The Company’s exposure on the
    forward-starting interest rate swaps varies with changes in
    Treasury rates and credit swap spreads and was approximately
    $27 million at December 31, 2008. Because we are
    unable to forecast changes in Treasury rates and credit swap
    spreads, we are unable to estimate our maximum exposure under
    our share of Millennium’s forward-starting interest rate
    swaps. An incremental .25% decrease in the forward interest rate
    swap rates will increase our exposure by approximately
    $4 million. There are no recourse provisions or collateral
    that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under the
    guarantees, other than our share of project assets.

Parent
    Company Guarantee of Subsidiary Obligations

Various non-utility subsidiaries of the Company have entered
    into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed
    by DTE Energy. These contracts contain provisions which allow
    the counterparties to request that the Company post cash or
    letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE
    Energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment
    grade. Certain of these provisions (known as “hard
    triggers”) state specific circumstances under which the
    Company can be asked to post collateral upon the occurrence of a
    credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as “soft
    triggers”) are not as specific. For contracts with soft
    triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral
    which may be requested by counterparties

and/or

which
    the Company may ultimately be required to post.

The amount of such collateral which could be requested
    fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily gas, power and
    coal) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying
    transactions. As of December 31, 2008, the value of the
    transactions for which the Company would have been exposed to
    collateral requests had the Company’s credit rating been
    below investment grade on such date was approximately
    $430 million. In circumstances where an entity is
    downgraded below investment grade and collateral requrests are
    made as a result, the requesting parties often agree to accept
    less than the full amount of their exposure to the downgraded
    entity.

Other
    Guarantees

The Company’s other guarantees are not individually
    material with maximum potential payments totaling
    $10 million at December 31, 2008.

The Company is often required to obtain performance surety bonds
    in support of obligations to various governmental entities and
    other companies in connection with its operations. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately
    $11 million of performance bonds outstanding. In the event
    that such bonds are called for nonperformance, the Company would
    be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond.
    The Company is released from the performance bonds as the
    contractual performance is completed and does not believe that a
    material amount of any currently outstanding performance bonds
    will be called.

Labor
    Contracts

There are several bargaining units for our union employees. The
    majority of our union employees are under contracts that expire
    in June and October 2010 and August 2012.

Purchase
    Commitments

Detroit Edison has an Energy Purchase Agreement to purchase
    electricity from the Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Authority
    (GDRRA). Under the Agreement, Detroit Edison purchased steam
    through 2008.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The term of the Energy Purchase Agreement for the purchase of
    electricity runs through June 2024. We purchased approximately
    $42 million of steam and electricity in each of 2008, 2007
    and 2006. We estimate electric purchase commitments from 2009
    through 2024 will not exceed $300 million in the aggregate.

In January 2003, the Company sold the steam heating business of
    Detroit Edison to Thermal Ventures II, LP. Under the terms of
    sale, Detroit Edison guaranteed bank loans of $13 million
    that Thermal Ventures II, LP used for capital improvements to
    the steam heating system. At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    the Company had reserves of $13 million related to the bank
    loan guarantee.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company was party to numerous
    long-term purchase commitments relating to a variety of goods
    and services required for the Company’s business. These
    agreements primarily consist of fuel supply commitments and
    energy trading contracts. The Company estimates that these
    commitments will be approximately $5.9 billion from 2009
    through 2051. The Company also estimates that 2009 capital
    expenditures will be approximately $1.1 billion. The
    Company has made certain commitments in connection with expected
    capital expenditures.

Bankruptcies

The Company purchases and sells electricity, gas, coal, coke and
    other energy products from and to numerous companies operating
    in the steel, automotive, energy, retail and other industries.
    Certain of the Company’s customers have filed for
    bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Company regularly reviews
    contingent matters relating to these customers and its purchase
    and sale contracts and it records provisions for amounts
    considered at risk of probable loss. Management believes the
    Company’s previously accrued amounts are adequate for
    probable losses. The final resolution of these matters may have
    a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Our utilities and certain non-utility businesses provide
    services to the domestic automotive industry, including GM, Ford
    and Chrysler and many of their vendors and suppliers. GM and
    Chrysler have recently received loans from the
    U.S. Government to provide them with the working capital
    necessary to continue to operate in the short term. In February
    2009, GM and Chrysler submitted viability plans to the
    U.S. Government indicating that additional loans were
    necessary to continue operations in the short term. Further
    plant closures, bankruptcies or a federal government mandated
    restructuring program could have a significant impact on our
    results, particularly in our Electric Utility and Power and
    Industrial Projects segments. As the circumstances surrounding
    the viability of these entities are dynamic and uncertain, we
    continue to monitor developments as they occur.

Other
    Contingencies

The Company is involved in certain legal, regulatory,
    administrative and environmental proceedings before various
    courts, arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning
    claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These
    proceedings include certain contract disputes, additional
    environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from
    various regulators, and pending judicial matters. The Company
    cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. The
    Company regularly reviews legal matters and records provisions
    for claims it can estimate and are considered probable of loss.
    The resolution of these pending proceedings is not expected to
    have a material effect on the Company’s operations or
    financial statements in the periods they are resolved.

See Note 5 for a discussion of contingencies related to
    Regulatory Matters.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS AND TRUSTEED ASSETS

Adoption
    of SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an Amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

.
    SFAS No. 158 requires companies to (1) recognize
    the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans in its financial
    statements, (2) recognize as a component of other
    comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses
    and the prior service costs or credits that arise during the
    period but are not immediately recognized as components of net
    periodic benefit cost, (3) recognize adjustments to other
    comprehensive income when the actuarial gains or losses, prior
    service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations
    are recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost,
    (4) measure postretirement benefit plan assets and plan
    obligations as of the date of the employer’s statement of
    financial position, and (5) disclose additional information
    in the notes to financial statements about certain effects on
    net periodic benefit cost in the upcoming fiscal year that arise
    from delayed recognition of the actuarial gains and losses and
    the prior service cost and credits.

The requirement to recognize the funded status of a
    postretirement benefit plan and the related disclosure
    requirements is effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2006. The Company adopted this requirement as
    of December 31, 2006. In 2008, as required by
    SFAS 158, we changed the measurement date of our pension
    and postretirement benefit plans from November 30 to
    December 31. As a result, we recognized adjustments of
    $17 million ($9 million after-tax) and $4 million
    to retained earnings and regulatory liabilities, respectively,
    which represents approximately one month of pension and other
    postretirement benefit costs for the period from
    December 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Retrospective
    application of the changes required by SFAS No. 158 is
    prohibited; therefore certain disclosures below are not
    comparable.

Detroit Edison and MichCon received approval from the MPSC to
    record the impact of the adoption of the SFAS 158
    provisions related to funded status as a regulatory asset or
    liability since the traditional rate setting process allows for
    the recovery of pension and other postretirement plan costs.

Measurement
    Date

All amounts and balances reported in the following tables as of
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 are based on
    measurement dates of December 31, 2008 and
    November 30, 2007, respectively.

Pension
    Plan Benefits

The Company has qualified defined benefit retirement plans for
    eligible represented and non-represented employees. The plans
    are noncontributory and cover substantially all employees. The
    plans provide traditional retirement benefits based on the
    employees’ years of benefit service, average final
    compensation and age at retirement. In addition, certain
    represented and non-represented employees are covered under cash
    balance provisions that determine benefits on annual employer
    contributions and interest credits. The Company also maintains
    supplemental nonqualified, noncontributory, retirement benefit
    plans for selected management employees. These plans provide for
    benefits that supplement those provided by DTE Energy’s
    other retirement plans.

The Company’s policy is to fund pension costs by
    contributing amounts consistent with the Pension Protection Act
    of 2006 provisions and additional amounts when it deems
    appropriate. In December 2008, the Company contributed
    $100 million to the pension plans. Also, the Company
    contributed $50 million to the pension plans in January
    2009. The Company anticipates making up to a $250 million
    contribution to its pension plans in 2009.

DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Company employs a formal process in determining the
    long-term rate of return for various asset classes. Management
    reviews historic financial market risks and returns and
    long-term historic relationships between the asset classes of
    equities, fixed income and other assets, consistent with the
    widely accepted capital market principle that asset classes with
    higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-term.
    Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates, asset
    class risks and asset class returns are evaluated and considered
    before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The
    long-term portfolio return is also established employing a
    consistent formal process, with due consideration of
    diversification, active investment management and rebalancing.
    Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness.

The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a
    mix of equities, fixed income and other investments are used to
    maximize the long-term return on plan assets consistent with
    prudent levels of risk. The intent of this strategy is to
    minimize plan expenses over the long-term. Risk tolerance is
    established through consideration of future plan cash flows,
    plan funded status, and corporate financial considerations. The
    investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity,
    fixed income and other investments. Furthermore, equity
    investments are diversified across U.S. and

non-U.S. stocks,

growth and value investment styles, and large and small market
    capitalizations. Other assets such as private equity and hedge
    funds are used to enhance long-term returns while improving
    portfolio diversification. Derivatives may be utilized in a risk
    controlled manner, to potentially increase the portfolio beyond
    the market value of invested assets and reduce portfolio
    investment risk. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an
    ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic
    asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio
    reviews.

    allocations by asset category at December 31 were as follows:

The Company also sponsors defined contribution retirement
    savings plans. Participation in one of these plans is available
    to substantially all represented and non-represented employees.
    The Company matches employee contributions up to certain
    predefined limits based upon eligible compensation, the
    employee’s contribution rate and, in some cases, years of
    credited service. The cost of these plans was $33 million
    in 2008 and $29 million in each of the years 2007 and 2006.

Other
    Postretirement Benefits

The Company provides certain postretirement health care and life
    insurance benefits for employees who are eligible for these
    benefits. The Company’s policy is to fund certain trusts to
    meet its postretirement benefit obligations. Separate qualified
    Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts exist
    for represented and non-represented employees. In December 2008,
    the Company made cash contributions of $116 million to its
    postretirement benefit plans. In January 2009, the Company made
    cash contributions of $40 million to its postretirement
    benefit plans. At the discretion of management, the Company may
    make up to an additional $130 million contribution to its
    VEBA trusts in 2009.

In December 2003, the Medicare Act was signed into law which
    provides for a non-taxable federal subsidy to sponsors of
    retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is
    at least “actuarially equivalent” to the benefit
    established by law. The effects of the subsidy reduced net
    periodic postretirement benefit costs by $14 million in
    2008, $16 million in 2007, and $17 million in 2006.

    benefit obligations that invests in life insurance contracts and
    income securities. Employees and retirees have no right, title
    or interest in the assets of the Grantor Trust, and MichCon can
    revoke the trust subject to providing the MPSC with prior
    notification. The Company accounts for its investment at fair
    value with unrealized gains and losses recorded to earnings.

NOTE 19 —

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

The Company’s stock incentive program permits the grant of
    incentive stock options, non-qualifying stock options, stock
    awards, performance shares and performance units to employees
    and members of its Board of Directors. Key provisions of the
    stock incentive program are:

•

Authorized limit is 9,000,000 shares of common stock;

•

Prohibits the grant of a stock option with an exercise price
    that is less than the fair market value of the Company’s
    stock on the date of the grant; and

•

Imposes the following award limits to a single participant in a
    single calendar year, (1) options for more than
    500,000 shares of common stock; (2) stock awards for
    more than 150,000 shares of common stock;
    (3) performance share awards for more than
    300,000 shares of common stock (based on the maximum payout
    under the award); or (4) more than 1,000,000 performance
    units, which have a face amount of $1.00 each.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment,

using the
    modified prospective transition method. Under this method, the
    Company records compensation expense at fair

value over the vesting period for all awards it grants after the
    date it adopted the standard. In addition, the Company is
    required to record compensation expense at fair value (as
    previous awards continue to vest) for the unvested portion of
    previously granted stock option awards that were outstanding as
    of the date of adoption. Pre-adoption grants of stock awards and
    performance shares will continue to be expensed. DTE Energy did
    not make the one-time election to adopt the alternative
    transition method described in FSP SFAS No. 123(R)-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effect
    of Share-Based Payment Awards,

but has chosen instead to
    follow the original guidance provided by
    SFAS No. 123(R) in accounting for the tax effects of
    stock based compensation awards.

Stock-based compensation for the reporting periods is as follows:

The cumulative effect of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006 was an increase in net income
    of $1 million as a result of estimating forfeitures for
    previously granted stock awards and performance shares. The
    Company generally purchases shares on the open market for
    options that are exercised or it may settle in cash other
    stock-based compensation.

Options

Options are exercisable according to the terms of the individual
    stock option award agreements and expire 10 years after the
    date of the grant. The option exercise price equals the fair
    value of the stock on the date that the option was granted.
    Stock options vest ratably over a three-year period.

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),

    and volatility assumptions. The Company modified option
    volatility to include both historical and implied share-price
    volatility. Implied volatility is derived from exchange traded
    options on DTE Energy common stock. The Company’s expected
    life estimate is based on industry standards.

Stock
    Awards

Stock awards granted under the plan are restricted for varying
    periods, generally for three years. Participants have all rights
    of a shareholder with respect to a stock award, including the
    right to receive dividends and vote the shares. Prior to vesting
    in stock awards, the participant: (i) may not sell,
    transfer, pledge, exchange or otherwise dispose of shares;
    (ii) shall not retain custody of the share certificates;
    and (iii) will deliver to the Company a stock power with
    respect to each stock award.

The stock awards are recorded at cost that approximates fair
    value on the date of grant. The cost is amortized to
    compensation expense over the vesting period.

Performance
    Share Awards

Performance shares awarded under the plan are for a specified
    number of shares of common stock that entitle the holder to
    receive a cash payment, shares of common stock or a combination
    thereof. The final value of the award is determined by the
    achievement of certain performance objectives and market
    conditions. The awards vest at the end of a specified period,
    usually three years. The Company accounts for performance share
    awards by accruing compensation expense over the vesting period
    based on: (i) the number of shares expected to be paid
    which is based on the probable achievement of performance
    objectives; and (ii) the closing stock price market value.
    The settlement of the award is at based on the closing price at
    the settlement date.

    risk of forfeiture.

DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The income tax provisions or benefits of DTE Energy’s
    subsidiaries are determined on an individual company basis and
    recognize the tax benefit of production tax credits and net
    operating losses. The subsidiaries record income tax payable to
    or receivable from DTE Energy resulting from the inclusion of
    its taxable income or loss in DTE Energy’s consolidated
    federal tax return.

Inter-segment billing for goods and services exchanged between

Net income of the Unconventional Gas production segment in 2008
    reflects the gain recognized on the sale of Barnett shale
    properties. Operating revenues and net loss of the
    Unconventional Gas Production segment in 2007 reflect the
    recognition of losses on hedge contracts associated with the
    Antrim sale transaction. Net Income of the Corporate &
    Other segment in 2007 results principally from the gain
    recognized on the Antrim sale transaction. See Note 3.
