ELECTRIC
    UTILITY

Description

Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison. Our
    generating plants are regulated by numerous federal and state
    governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC,
    the FERC, the NRC, the EPA and the MDNRE. Electricity is
    generated from our several fossil plants, a hydroelectric pumped
    storage plant and a nuclear plant, and is purchased from
    electricity generators, suppliers and wholesalers. The
    electricity we produce and purchase is sold to three major
    classes of customers: residential, commercial and industrial,
    principally throughout southeastern Michigan.

Weather, economic factors, competition and electricity prices
    affect sales levels to customers. Our peak load and highest
    total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of
    the year, driven by air conditioning and other cooling-related
    demands. Our operations are not dependent upon a limited number
    of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would
    not have a material adverse effect on Detroit Edison.

Fuel
    Supply and Purchased Power

Our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is
    supplemented with purchased power. We expect to have an adequate
    supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to
    serve customers. Our generating capability is heavily dependent
    upon the availability of coal. Coal is purchased from various
    sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary
    in both pricing and terms. We expect to obtain the majority of
    our coal requirements through long-term contracts, with the
    balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot
    purchases. We have long-term and short-term contracts for a
    total purchase of approximately 30 million tons of
    low-sulfur western coal to be delivered from 2011 through 2013
    and approximately 5 million tons of Appalachian coal to be
    delivered from 2011 through 2012. All of these contracts have
    pricing schedules. We have approximately 98% of our 2011
    expected coal requirements under contract. Given the geographic
    diversity of supply, we believe we can meet our expected
    generation requirements. We lease a fleet of rail cars and have
    our expected western rail requirements under contract for the
    next five years. All of our eastern coal rail requirements are
    under contract through 2012 and approximately 50% of this
    requirement is under contract in 2013. Our expected vessel
    transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to
    our generating facilities are under contract through 2014.

Detroit Edison participates in the energy market through MISO.
    We offer our generation in the market on a day-ahead, real-time
    and FTR basis and bid for power in the market to serve our load.
    We are a net purchaser of power that supplements our generation
    capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles.

In 2008, a renewable portfolio standard was established for
    Michigan electric providers targeting 10% of electricity sold to
    retail customers from renewable energy by 2015. Detroit Edison
    has approximately 251 MW of renewable energy under contract
    at December 31, 2010 representing approximately 4% of
    electricity sold to retail customers. Approximately 40 MW
    is in commercial operation at December 31, 2010 with an
    additional 211 MW expected in commercial operation in 2011
    or early 2012.

Properties

Detroit Edison owns generating plants and facilities that are
    located in the State of Michigan. Substantially all of our
    property is subject to the lien of a mortgage.

There are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange
    of electricity between Detroit Edison and electricity providers
    external to our service area. These interconnections are
    generally owned and operated by ITC Transmission, an unrelated
    company, and connect to neighboring energy companies.

Regulation

Detroit Edison’s business is subject to the regulatory
    jurisdiction of various agencies, including, but not limited to,
    the MPSC, the FERC and the NRC. The MPSC issues orders
    pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the
    costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions
    of service, accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit
    Edison’s MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have
    historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs,
    plus an authorized rate of return on our investments. The FERC
    regulates Detroit Edison with respect to financing authorization
    and wholesale electric activities. The NRC has regulatory
    jurisdiction over all phases of the operation, construction,
    licensing and decommissioning of Detroit Edison’s nuclear
    plant operations. We are subject to the requirements of other
    regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment and
    health.

See Notes 4, 9, 12 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Energy
    Assistance Programs

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and
    the State of Michigan, remain critical to Detroit Edison’s
    ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and
    collections expenses. Detroit Edison’s uncollectible
    accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of
    government-funded assistance its qualifying customers receive.
    We work continuously with the State of Michigan and others to
    determine whether the share of funding allocated to our
    customers is representative of the number of low-income
    individuals in our service territory.

Strategy
    and Competition

We strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation
    in southeast Michigan. We can accomplish this goal by working
    with our customers, communities and regulatory agencies to be a
    reliable, low-cost supplier of electricity. To ensure generation
    and network reliability we continue to make capital investments
    in our generating plants and distribution system, which will
    improve plant availability, operating efficiencies and
    environmental compliance in areas that have a positive impact on
    reliability with the goal of high customer satisfaction.

Our distribution operations focus on improving reliability,
    restoration time and the quality of customer service. We seek to
    lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies.
    Revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions,
    economic factors, regulatory events and other risk factors as
    discussed in the “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of
    this Report. We are minimizing the impacts of changes in average
    customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which decouple our
    revenue levels from sales volumes.

The electric Customer Choice program in Michigan allows all of
    our electric customers to purchase their electricity from
    alternative electric suppliers of generation services, subject
    to limits. Customers choosing to purchase power from alternative
    electric suppliers represented approximately 10% of retail sales
    in 2010 and 3% of retail sales in 2009 and 2008. Customers
    participating in the electric Customer Choice program consist
    primarily of industrial and commercial customers whose
    MPSC-authorized full service rates exceed their cost of service.
    MPSC rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the
    State of Michigan are adjusting the pricing disparity over five
    years and have placed a 10% cap on the total potential Customer
    Choice related migration, mitigating some of the unfavorable
    effects of electric Customer Choice on our financial
    performance. In addition, we have a Choice Incentive Mechanism,
    which is an over/under recovery mechanism that measures non-fuel
    revenues lost or gained as a result of fluctuations in electric
    Customer Choice sales. If annual electric Customer Choice sales
    exceed the baseline amount from Detroit Edison’s most
    recent rate case, 90 percent of its lost non-fuel revenues
    associated with sales above that level may be recovered from
    full service customers. If annual electric Customer Choice sales
    decrease below the baseline, the Company must refund
    90 percent of its increase in non-fuel revenues associated
    with sales below that level to full service customers. We expect
    that in 2011 customers choosing to purchase power from
    alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10%
    of retail sales.



Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is
    primarily from the

on-site

generation of industrial customers and from distributed
    generation applications by industrial and commercial customers.
    We do not expect significant competition for distribution to any
    group of customers in the near term.

GAS
    UTILITY

Description

Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens.

Revenue is generated by providing the following major classes of
    service: gas sales, end user transportation, intermediate
    transportation, and gas storage.

Gas sales —

Includes the sale and delivery of
    natural gas primarily to residential and small-volume commercial
    and industrial customers.

•

End user transportation —

Gas delivery service
    provided primarily to large-volume commercial and industrial
    customers. Additionally, the service is provided to residential
    customers, and small-volume commercial and industrial customers
    who have elected to participate in our Customer Choice program.
    End user transportation customers purchase natural gas directly
    from producers or brokers and utilize our pipeline network to
    transport the gas to their facilities or homes.

•

Intermediate transportation —

Gas delivery
    service is provided to producers, brokers and other gas
    companies that own the natural gas, but are not the ultimate
    consumers. Intermediate transportation customers utilize our
    gathering and high-pressure transportation system to transport
    the gas to storage fields, processing plants, pipeline
    interconnections or other locations.

•

Storage and other —

Includes revenues from gas
    storage, appliance maintenance, facility development and other
    energy-related services.

Our gas sales, end user transportation and intermediate
    transportation volumes, revenues and net income are impacted by
    weather. Given the seasonal nature of our business, revenues and
    net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of
    the calendar year. By the end of the first quarter, the heating
    season is largely over, and we typically realize substantially
    reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses
    in the third quarter. We are minimizing the impacts of changes
    in average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which
    decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes.

Our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of
    customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not
    have a material adverse effect on our Gas Utility segment.

Natural
    Gas Supply

Our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily send-out
    capacity of 2.4 Bcf, with approximately 65% of the volume
    coming from underground storage for 2010. Peak-use requirements
    are met through utilization of our storage facilities, pipeline
    transportation capacity, and purchased gas supplies. Because of
    our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline
    transportation and storage capacity, we are able to reliably
    meet our supply



requirements. We believe natural gas supply and pipeline
    capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands
    in the foreseeable future.

We purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by
    contracting with producers and marketers, and we maintain a
    diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts. Supplier,
    producing region, quantity, and available transportation
    diversify our natural gas supply base. We obtain our natural gas
    supply from various sources in different geographic areas (Gulf
    Coast, Mid-Continent, Canada and Michigan) under agreements that
    vary in both pricing and terms. Gas supply pricing is generally
    tied to the New York Mercantile Exchange and published price
    indices to approximate current market prices combined with MPSC
    approved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes
    through 2014.

We are directly connected to interstate pipelines, providing

Properties

We own distribution, storage and transportation properties that
    are located in the State of Michigan. Our distribution system
    includes approximately 19,000 miles of distribution mains,
    approximately 1,036,000 service lines and approximately
    1,319,000 active meters. We own approximately 2,000 miles
    of transportation lines that deliver natural gas to the
    distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with
    the sources of supply and the market areas.

We own properties relating to four underground natural gas
    storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of
    approximately 134 Bcf. These facilities are important in
    providing reliable and cost-effective service to our customers.
    In addition, we sell storage services to third parties. Most of
    our distribution and transportation property is located on
    property owned by others and used by us through easements,
    permits or licenses. Substantially all of our property is
    subject to the lien of a mortgage.

We own 602 miles of transportation and gathering
    (non-utility) pipelines in the northern lower peninsula of
    Michigan. We lease a portion of our pipeline system to the
    Vector Pipeline Partnership (an affiliate) through a capital
    lease arrangement. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Report.

Regulation

MichCon’s business is subject to the regulatory
    jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to
    rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of
    regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting and
    operating-related matters. MichCon’s MPSC-approved rates
    charged to customers have historically been designed to allow
    for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on
    our investments. MichCon operates natural gas storage and
    transportation facilities in Michigan as intrastate facilities
    regulated by the MPSC and provides intrastate storage and
    transportation services pursuant to an MPSC-approved tariff.

MichCon also provides interstate storage and transportation
    services in accordance with an Operating Statement on file with
    the FERC. The FERC’s jurisdiction is limited and extends to
    the rates, non-discriminatory requirements and terms and
    conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by
    MichCon in interstate markets. FERC granted MichCon authority to
    provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at
    market-based rates. MichCon provides transportation services in
    interstate commerce at cost-based rates approved by the MPSC and
    filed with the FERC.

We are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies
    with respect to safety, the environment and health.

See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.



Energy
    Assistance Program

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and
    the State of Michigan, remain critical to MichCon’s ability
    to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections
    expenses. MichCon’s uncollectible accounts receivable
    expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded
    assistance its qualifying customers receive. We work
    continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine
    whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is
    representative of the number of low-income individuals in our
    service territory.

Strategy
    and Competition

Our strategy is to be the preferred provider of natural gas in
    Michigan. We expect future sales volumes to decline as a result
    of economic conditions, a decrease in the number of customers,
    reduced natural gas usage by customers due to more efficient
    furnaces and appliances, and an increased emphasis on
    conservation of energy usage. We are minimizing the impacts of
    changes in average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms
    which decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes. We
    continue to provide energy-related services that capitalize on
    our expertise, capabilities and efficient systems. We continue
    to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving operating
    efficiencies.

Competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural
    gas providers, as well as providers of alternative fuels and
    energy sources. The primary focus of competition for end user
    transportation is cost and reliability. Some large commercial
    and industrial customers have the ability to switch to
    alternative fuel sources such as coal, electricity, oil and
    steam. If these customers were to choose an alternative fuel
    source, they would not have a need for our end-user
    transportation service. In addition, some of these customers
    could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered
    directly from an interstate pipeline. We compete against
    alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and
    reliable service, supported by our storage capacity.

Our extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled us to
    market 400 to 500 Bcf annually for intermediate storage and
    transportation services for Michigan gas producers, marketers,
    distribution companies and other pipeline companies. We operate
    in a central geographic location with connections to major
    Midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the
    Midwest, eastern United States and eastern Canada.

MichCon’s storage capacity is used to store natural gas for
    delivery to MichCon’s customers as well as sold to third
    parties, under a variety of arrangements for periods up to three
    years. Prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are
    generally higher, but more volatile than for longer periods.
    Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and natural
    gas pricing.

GAS
    STORAGE AND PIPELINES

Description

Gas Storage and Pipelines owns partnership interests in two
    interstate transmission pipelines and two natural gas storage
    fields. The pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported
    by long-term, fixed-price revenue contracts. We have a
    partnership interest in Vector Pipeline (Vector), an interstate
    transportation pipeline, which connects Michigan to Chicago and
    Ontario. We also hold partnership interests in Millennium
    Pipeline Company which indirectly connects southern New York
    State to Upper Midwest/Canadian supply, while providing
    transportation service into the New York City markets. We have
    storage assets in Michigan capable of storing up to 90 Bcf
    in natural gas storage fields located in Southeast Michigan. The
    Washington 10 and 28 storage facilities are high deliverability
    storage fields having bi-directional interconnections with
    Vector Pipeline and MichCon, providing our customers access to
    the Chicago, Michigan, other Midwest and Ontario markets. Our
    customers include various utilities, pipelines, and producers
    and marketers.

    MichCon provides physical operations, maintenance, and technical
    support for the Washington 28 and Washington 10 storage
    facilities.

Regulation

The Gas Storage and Pipelines business operates natural gas
    storage facilities in Michigan as intrastate facilities
    regulated by the MPSC and provides intrastate storage and
    related services pursuant to an MPSC-approved tariff. We also
    provide interstate services in accordance with an Operating
    Statement on file with the FERC. Vector and Millennium Pipelines
    provide interstate transportation services in accordance with
    their FERC-approved tariffs.

Strategy
    and Competition

Our Gas Storage and Pipelines business expects to continue its
    steady growth plan by expanding existing assets and developing
    new assets that are typically supported with long-term customer
    commitments. The Gas Storage and Pipelines business focuses on
    asset development opportunities in the

Midwest-to-Northeast

region to supply natural gas to meet growing demand. We expect
    much of the growth in the demand for natural gas in the
    U.S. to occur within the Mid-Atlantic and New England
    regions. We forecast these regions will require incremental
    pipeline and gas storage infrastructure necessary to deliver gas
    volumes to meet growing demand. Vector is an interstate pipeline
    that is filling a large portion of that need, and is
    complemented by our Michigan storage facilities. Due to the
    proximity of the Millennium Pipeline to the Marcellus shale in
    Southern New York/Northern Pennsylvania, we anticipate that the
    Millennium Pipeline may have opportunities to expand in the
    future.

UNCONVENTIONAL
    GAS PRODUCTION

Description

Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural
    gas and oil exploration, development and production primarily
    within the Barnett shale in north Texas. Our acreage covers an
    area that produces high Btu gas which provides a significant
    contribution to revenues from the value of natural gas liquids
    extracted from the gas stream. During this period of low natural
    gas prices, these natural gas liquids, with prices correlated to
    crude oil prices, have provided a significant increase to our
    realized wellhead price. Our drilling efforts this year have and
    will continue to target liquids rich gas and oil producing
    locations. Total capital investment of $26 million and
    production of 5 Bcfe remained consistent with 2009. We
    executed on leasing opportunities to optimize our existing
    portfolio by acquiring acreage at attractive prices in 2010,
    bringing our total net acreage position to 70,246 acres,
    net of impairments and expirations.

Outlook —

In the longer-term, we plan to
    continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the
    Barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional
    monetization of select properties when conditions are
    appropriate. Our strategy for 2011 is to maintain our focus on
    reducing operating expenses and optimizing production volume.
    Given the current outlook of low natural gas prices, drilling
    efforts will continue to target liquids rich gas and oil
    production. During 2011, we expect total capital investment of
    $25 million to drill approximately 20 new wells and
    continue to acquire select acreage and achieve production of
    approximately 6 Bcfe of natural gas, compared with
    5 Bcfe in 2010.

We manage and operate our properties to maximize returns on
    investment and increase earnings. We expect to continue
    acquiring additional acreage at attractive prices providing
    opportunities to create value at low cost. We will target
    properties with liquids rich gas and oil potential and our
    drilling efforts will continue to be focused on these areas. Due
    to increased activity in other shale plays throughout the
    country, the availability of service providers has decreased
    somewhat. However, we do not expect this to have a significant
    impact on our drilling plans or operations, since most oilfield
    services have been secured for the next 12 months.

From time to time, we may use financial derivative contracts to
    manage a portion of our exposure to changes in the price of
    natural gas and oil on our forecasted sales volume. At
    December 31, 2010, we had no long-term fixed



price contracts relating to natural gas and had the following
    financial contracts in place with our Energy Trading affiliate
    related to our projected oil production:

POWER AND
    INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS

Description

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects
    that deliver energy products and services to industrial,
    commercial and institutional customers; provide coal
    transportation and marketing; and sell electricity from
    biomass-fired energy projects. This business segment provides
    services using project assets usually located on or near the
    customers’ premises in the steel, automotive, pulp and
    paper, airport and other industries as follows:

Steel, Steel Industry Fuel, and Petroleum
    Coke:

We produce metallurgical coke from two coke
    batteries with a capacity of 1.4 million tons per year. We
    have an investment in a third coke battery with a capacity of
    1.2 million tons per year. We are investors in steel
    industry fuel entities which sell steel industry fuel at three
    coke battery sites. Steel industry fuels facilities recycle tar
    decanter sludge, a byproduct of the coking process. Tax credits
    were generated in 2009 and 2010. The ability to generate tax
    credits from the steel industry fuel process expired at
    December 31, 2010. We also provide pulverized coal and
    petroleum coke to the steel, pulp and paper, and other
    industries.

Onsite Energy:

We provide power generation,
    steam production, chilled water production, wastewater treatment
    and compressed air supply to industrial customers. This business
    segment provides utility-type services using project assets
    usually located on or near the customers’ premises in the
    automotive, airport and other industries.

Wholesale Power and Renewables:

We own and
    operate three biomass-fired electric generating plants with a
    capacity of 133 MWs. We own two coal-fired power plants
    currently undergoing conversions to biomass with expected
    in-service dates of the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first
    quarter of 2013. We own one gas-fired peaking electric
    generating plant. The electric output is sold under long term
    power purchase agreements. We also develop landfill gas recovery
    systems that capture the gas and provide local utilities,
    industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive,
    renewable source of energy, in addition to providing
    environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Reduced Emission Fuel:

We deliver reduced
    emission fuel to utilities with coal-fired electric generation
    power plants. We own and operate five facilities that process
    raw coal into reduced emission fuel resulting in reductions in
    Nitrogen Oxide (NO) and Mercury (Hg) emissions. We began
    generating production tax credits from these facilities
    beginning in 2009 which will continue through 2019 upon
    achieving certain criteria, including entering into transactions
    with unrelated equity partners or third-party customers for the
    reduced emission fuel. We continue to optimize these facilities
    by seeking investors for facilities operating at Detroit Edison
    sites, and intend to relocate other facilities to alternative
    sites which may provide increased production and emission
    reduction opportunities in 2011 and future years. In January
    2011, the Company entered into an agreement to sell a membership
    interest in one of these reduced emission fuel facilities that
    is located at a Detroit Edison site.

Coal Services:

The business provides coal
    transportation and related services including fuel to our
    customers with significant energy requirements which include
    electric utilities, merchant power producers, integrated steel
    mills and large industrial companies. We specialize in
    minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for
    those energy-intensive customers. We own and operate a coal
    transloading terminal which provides storage and blending for
    our customers. We also engage in coal marketing which includes
    the marketing and trading of physical coal and coal financial
    instruments, and forward contracts for the purchase and sale of
    emission allowances.

Regulation

Certain electric generating facilities within Power and
    Industrial Projects have market-based rate authority from the
    FERC to sell power. The facilities are subject to FERC reporting
    requirements and market behavior rules. Certain Power and
    Industrial projects are also subject to the applicable laws,
    rules and regulations related to the Commodity Futures Trading
    Commission, U.S. Department of Homeland Security and
    Department of Energy.



Strategy
    and Competition

Power and Industrial Projects will continue leveraging its
    energy-related operating experience and project management
    capability to develop and grow our steel; renewable power;

on-site

energy; coal marketing, storage and blending; landfill gas
    recovery; and reduced emission fuel businesses. We also will
    continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and
    operations services to third parties. There are limited
    competitors for our existing disparate businesses who provide
    similar products and services.

We anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets
    where we operate. In determining the markets in which to
    compete, we examine closely the regulatory and competitive
    environment, new and pending legislation, the number of
    competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins. We
    plan to maximize the effectiveness of our inter-related
    businesses as we expand. As we pursue growth opportunities, our
    first priority will be to achieve value-added returns.

We intend to focus on the following areas for growth:

•

Monetizing and relocating our reduced emission fuel facilities;

•

Acquiring and developing landfill gas recovery facilities,
    renewable energy projects, and other energy projects which may
    qualify for tax credits; and

•

Providing operating services to owners of industrial and power
    plants.

Our Coal Transportation and Marketing business will continue to
    leverage its existing business in 2011. Trends such as railroad
    and mining consolidation and the lack of certainty in developing
    new mines could have an impact on how we compete in the future.
    Effective January 1, 2011, our existing long-term rail
    transportation contract, at rates significantly below the
    current market, expired and we anticipate a decrease in
    transportation-related revenue of approximately
    $130 million as a result. We will continue to work with
    suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive
    access to coal to meet the energy requirements of our customers.

ENERGY
    TRADING

Description

Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas
    marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of
    returns from DTE Energy’s asset portfolio, optimization of
    contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and
    power transmission and generating capacity positions. Energy
    Trading also provides natural gas, power and ancillary services
    to various utilities which may include the management of
    associated storage and transportation contracts on the
    customers’ behalf. Our customer base is predominantly
    utilities, local distribution companies, pipelines, and other
    marketing and trading companies. We enter into derivative
    financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging
    activities. These financial instruments are generally accounted
    for under the

mark-to-market

method, which results in the recognition in earnings of
    unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of
    the derivatives. We utilize forwards, futures, swaps and option
    contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and
    trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within
    defined risk guidelines. Energy Trading also provides commodity
    risk management services to the other businesses within DTE
    Energy.

Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are
    economically hedged. Most financial instruments and physical
    power and gas contracts are deemed derivatives; whereas, gas
    inventory, power transmission, pipeline transportation and
    certain storage assets are not derivatives. As a result, this
    segment may experience earnings volatility as derivatives are

marked-to-market

without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and
    assets. The segment’s strategy is to economically manage
    the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and
    assets with futures, forwards, swaps and options. This results
    in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and
    annual accounting periods.

Regulation

Energy Trading has market-based rate authority from the FERC to
    sell power and blanket authority from the FERC to sell natural
    gas at market prices. Energy Trading is subject to FERC
    reporting requirements and market



behavior rules. Energy Trading is also subject to the applicable
    laws, rules and regulations related to the Commodity Futures
    Trading Commission, U.S. Department of Homeland Security
    and Department of Energy.

Strategy
    and Competition

Our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver
    value-added services to our customers. We seek to manage this
    business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the
    growth of our other business segments. We focus on physical
    marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy
    assets. We compete with electric and gas marketers, financial
    institutions, traders, utilities and other energy providers. The
    trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital
    and an investment grade credit rating. The Company believes it
    has ample available capital capacity to support Energy Trading
    activities. We monitor our use of capital closely to ensure that
    our commitments do not exceed capacity. A material credit
    restriction would negatively impact our financial performance.
    Competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost
    may have a competitive advantage. We have risk management and
    credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk.

CORPORATE &
    OTHER

Description

Corporate & Other includes various holding company
    activities and holds certain non-utility debt and energy-related
    investments.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

We are subject to extensive environmental regulation. Additional
    costs may result as the effects of various substances on the
    environment are studied and governmental regulations are
    developed and implemented. Actual costs to comply could vary
    substantially. We expect to continue recovering environmental
    costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our
    customers. The following table summarizes our estimated
    significant future environmental expenditures based upon current

Air —

Detroit Edison is subject to the EPA
    ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant
    emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Since 2005, the
    EPA and the State of Michigan have issued additional emission
    reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate,
    regional haze and mercury air pollution. The new rules will lead
    to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
    nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. Further,
    additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years
    which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide,
    nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants. It is not possible
    to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this
    time.

In July 2009, DTE Energy received a Notice of Violation/Finding
    of Violation (NOV/FOV) from the EPA alleging, among other
    things, that five Detroit Edison power plants violated New
    Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration requirements, and operating permit requirements
    under the Clean Air Act. An additional NOV/FOV was received in
    June 2010 related to a recent project and outage at Unit 2 of
    the Monroe Power Plant.



On August 5, 2010, the United States Department of Justice,
    at the request of the EPA, brought a civil suit in the
    U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
    against DTE Energy and Detroit Edison, related to the
    June 2010 NOV/FOV and the outage work performed at Unit 2
    of the Monroe Power Plant, but not relating to the July 2009
    NOV/FOV. Among other relief, the EPA requested the court to
    require Detroit Edison to install and operate the best available
    control technology at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant. Further,
    the EPA requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to
    require Detroit Edison to (i) begin the process of
    obtaining the necessary permits for the Monroe Unit 2
    modification and (ii) offset the pollution from Monroe Unit
    2 through emissions reductions from Detroit Edison’s fleet
    of coal-fired power plants until the new control equipment is
    operating. In January 2011, the EPA’s motion for
    preliminary injunction was denied and the liability phase of the
    civil suit has been scheduled for trial in May 2011.

DTE Energy and Detroit Edison believe that the plants identified
    by the EPA, including Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant, have
    complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations.
    Depending upon the outcome of discussions with the EPA regarding
    the NOV/FOV and the result of the civil action, the Company
    could also be required to install additional pollution control
    equipment at some or all of the power plants in question,
    implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment
    is not economical, engage in supplemental environmental
    programs,

and/or

pay
    fines. The Company cannot predict the financial impact or
    outcome of this matter, or the timing of its resolution.

Water

— In response to an EPA regulation,
    Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing
    the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures
    at several of its facilities. Based on the results of completed
    studies and expected future studies, Detroit Edison may be
    required to install additional control technologies to reduce
    the impacts of the water intakes. Initially, it was estimated
    that Detroit Edison could incur up to approximately
    $55 million in additional capital expenditures over the
    four to six years subsequent to 2008 to comply with these
    requirements. However, a January 2007 circuit court decision
    remanded back to the EPA several provisions of the federal
    regulation that has resulted in a delay in compliance dates. The
    decision also raised the possibility that Detroit Edison may
    have to install cooling towers at some facilities at a cost
    substantially greater than was initially estimated for other
    mitigative technologies. In 2008, the Supreme Court agreed to
    review the remanded cost-benefit analysis provision of the rule
    and in April 2009 upheld the EPA’s use of this provision in
    determining best technology available for reducing environmental
    impacts. Concurrently, the EPA continues to develop a revised
    rule, a draft of which is expected to be published in the first
    quarter of 2011, with a final rule scheduled for mid-2012. The
    EPA has also issued an information collection request to begin a
    review of steam electric effluent guidelines. It is not possible
    at this time to quantify the impacts of these developing
    requirements.

Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) and Other Sites —

Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas
    pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured
    locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. The
    facilities, which produced gas, have been designated as MGP
    sites. Gas Utility owns, or previously owned, fifteen such
    former MGP sites. Detroit Edison owns, or previously owned,
    three former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP sites, we are
    also in the process of cleaning up other sites where
    contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing
    utility operations. These other sites include an engineered ash
    storage facility, electrical distribution substations, gas
    pipelines, and underground and aboveground storage tank
    locations. Cleanup activities associated with these sites will
    be conducted over the next several years.

Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation
    techniques, nature and extent of contamination and regulatory
    requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs
    for the sites and affect the Company’s financial position
    and cash flows. The Company anticipates the cost amortization
    methodology approved by the MPSC for MichCon, which allows
    MichCon to amortize the MGP costs over a ten-year period
    beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs
    were incurred, and the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism
    for Citizens Fuel Gas approved by the City of Adrian, will
    prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse
    impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Landfill

— Detroit Edison owns and operates a
    permitted engineered ash storage facility at the Monroe Power
    Plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant.
    Detroit Edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and
    identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and
    reconstruction.



The EPA has published proposed rules to regulate coal ash under
    the authority of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act
    (RCRA). The proposed rule published on June 21, 2010
    contains two primary regulatory options to regulate coal ash
    residue. The EPA is currently considering either, to designate
    coal ash as a “Hazardous Waste” as defined by RCRA or
    to regulate coal ash as non-hazardous waste under RCRA. However,
    agencies and legislatures have urged the EPA to regulate coal
    ash as a non-hazardous waste. If the EPA were to designate coal
    ash as a hazardous waste, the agency could apply some, or all,
    of the disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to
    other existing hazardous wastes. Some of the regulatory actions
    currently being contemplated could have a significant impact on
    our operations and financial position and the rates we charge
    our customers. It is not possible to quantify the impact of
    those expected rulemakings at this time.

Non-Utility

The Company’s non-utility affiliates are subject to a
    number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the
    protection of the environment from various pollutants.

The Michigan coke battery facility received and responded to
    information requests from the EPA that resulted in the issuance
    of a Notice of Violation in June of 2007 alleging potential
    maximum achievable control technologies and new source review
    violations. The EPA is in the process of reviewing the
    Company’s position of demonstrated compliance and has not
    initiated escalated enforcement. At this time, the Company
    cannot predict the impact of this issue. Furthermore, the
    Michigan coke battery facility is the subject of an
    investigation by the MDNRE concerning visible emissions readings
    that resulted from the Company self reporting to the MDNRE
    questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired by
    the Company to perform the visible emissions readings. At this
    time, the Company cannot predict the impact of this
    investigation.

The Company is also in the process of settling historical air
    and water violations at its coke battery facility located in
    Pennsylvania. At this time, the Company cannot predict the
    impact of this settlement. The Company received two notices of
    violation from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
    Protection in 2010 alleging violations of the permit for the
    Pennsylvania coke battery facility in connection with coal pile
    storm water runoff. The Company has implemented best management
    practices to address this issue and is currently seeking a
    permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
    Protection to upgrade its wastewater treatment technology to a
    biological treatment facility. The Company’s non-utility
    affiliates are substantially in compliance with all
    environmental requirements, other than as noted above.

Global
    Climate Change

Climate regulation

and/or

legislation is being proposed and discussed within the
    U.S. Congress and the EPA. Despite passage of a greenhouse
    gas cap and trade bill by the U.S. House in June 2009, the
    Senate has been unable to pass a similar climate bill. A
    greenhouse gas cap and trade program is not expected to be
    included in energy or climate bills to be considered by the
    112th Congress. Meanwhile, the EPA is beginning to implement
    regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act to address emission
    of greenhouse gases. The EPA regulation of greenhouse gases
    (GHGs) begins in 2011 requiring the best available control
    technology (BACT) for major sources or modifications to existing
    major sources that cause significant increases in GHG emissions.
    The impact of this rule is uncertain until BACT is better
    defined by the permitting agencies. Pending or future
    legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material
    impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we
    charge our customers. Impacts include expenditures for
    environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned,
    financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the
    purchase of emission offsets from market sources and the
    retirement of facilities where control equipment is not
    economical. We would seek to recover these incremental costs
    through increased rates charged to our utility customers.
    Increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources
    could also increase the economic viability of energy produced
    from renewable

and/or

nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the
    development of market-based trading of carbon offsets providing
    business opportunities for our utility and non-utility segments.
    It is not possible to quantify these impacts on DTE Energy or
    its customers at this time.

See Notes 12 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report and Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this Report.



EMPLOYEES

We had approximately 9,800 employees as of
    December 31, 2010, of which approximately 5,000 were
    represented by unions. There are several bargaining units for
    the Company’s represented employees. In the 2010 third
    quarter, a new three-year agreement was ratified covering
    approximately 3,800 represented employees. The majority of the
    remaining represented employees are under contracts that expire
    in June 2011 and August 2012.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE
    Energy’s utility and non-utility businesses. To provide a
    framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy,
    we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant
    risks associated with our businesses. Although we have tried to
    identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in
    the future. Each of the following risks could affect our
    performance.

Regional and national economic conditions can have an
    unfavorable impact on us.

Our utility and
    non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the
    customers we serve. Our utilities and certain non-utility
    businesses provide services to the domestic automotive and steel
    industries which have undergone considerable financial distress,
    exacerbating the decline in regional economic conditions. Should
    national or regional economic conditions further decline,
    reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy
    services we supply, collections of accounts receivable and
    potentially higher levels of lost or stolen gas could result in
    decreased earnings and cash flow.

We are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom we
    do business.

Adverse economic conditions
    affecting, or financial difficulties of, counterparties with
    whom we do business could impair the ability of these
    counterparties to pay for our services or fulfill their
    contractual obligations, or cause them to delay such payments or
    obligations. We depend on these counterparties to remit payments
    on a timely basis. Any delay or default in payment could
    adversely affect our cash flows, financial position, or results
    of operations.

We are subject to rate regulation.

Electric
    and gas rates for our utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC
    and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. We may
    be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by
    the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. Our ability to
    recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the
    incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in
    customers’ rates. Our regulators also may decide to
    disallow recovery of certain costs in customers’ rates if
    they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for
    recovery under our governing laws and regulations. The State of
    Michigan elected a new governor and legislature in November 2010
    and we cannot predict whether the resulting changes in political
    conditions will affect the regulations or interpretations
    affecting our utilities. New legislation, regulations or
    interpretations could change how our business operates, impact
    our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require
    us to incur additional expenses.

We may be required to refund amounts we collect under
    self-implemented rates.

Michigan law allows our
    utilities to self-implement base rate changes six months after a
    rate filing, subject to certain limitations. However, if the
    final rate case order provides for lower rates than we have
    self-implemented, we must refund the difference, with interest.
    We have self-implemented rates in the past and have been ordered
    to make refunds to customers. Our financial performance may be
    negatively affected if the MPSC sets lower rates in future rate
    cases than those we have self-implemented, thereby requiring us
    to issue refunds. We cannot predict what rates an MPSC order
    will adopt in future rate cases.

Michigan’s electric Customer Choice program could
    negatively impact our financial performance.

The
    electric Customer Choice program, as originally contemplated in
    Michigan, anticipated an eventual transition to a totally
    deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be
    charged market-based rates for their electricity. The State of
    Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC
    continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while
    alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates. In
    addition, such regulated electric rates for certain groups of
    our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers. Due
    to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial
    implementation period of electric Customer Choice, many
    commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers. MPSC
    rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the State of
    Michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years
    and have placed a cap on the total



potential Customer Choice related migration. However, even with
    the electric Customer Choice-related relief received in recent
    Detroit Edison rate orders and the legislated 10 percent
    cap on participation in the electric Customer Choice program,
    there continues to be financial risk associated with the
    electric Customer Choice program. Electric Customer Choice
    migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric
    price changes.

Environmental laws and liability may be
    costly.

We are subject to numerous environmental
    regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water
    quality, wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and
    hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can
    significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and
    plant down times. These laws and regulations require us to seek
    a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and
    other regulatory approvals. We could be required to install
    expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease
    activities based on these regulations. Additionally, we may
    become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites
    identified by a regulatory body. We cannot predict with
    certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related
    to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating
    clean up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying
    liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and
    several liability on potentially responsible parties.

We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future
    requirements to address climate change issues. Proposals for
    voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed
    both in the United States and worldwide to reduce greenhouse
    gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil
    fuels. If increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are
    implemented, the operations of our fossil-fuel generation assets
    and our unconventional gas production assets may be
    significantly impacted. Since there can be no assurances that
    environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory
    process, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as
    a result of environmental matters.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect
    us.

Regional and national economic
    condition

s

, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and
    regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic
    performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our
    credit rating. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the
    credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily
    reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating
    below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability
    to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our
    borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures and
    could impact future earnings and cash flows. In addition, a
    reduction in credit rating may require us to post collateral
    related to various physical or financially settled contracts for
    the purchase of energy-related commodities, products and
    services, which could impact our liquidity.

Our ability to access capital markets is
    important.

Our ability to access capital markets
    is important to operate our businesses. In the past, turmoil in
    credit markets has constrained, and may again in the future
    constrain, our ability as well as the ability of our
    subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and
    refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates. In
    addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and
    the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets.
    We have substantial amounts of credit facilities that expire in
    2012 and 2013. We intend to seek to renew the facilities on or
    before the expiration dates. However, we cannot predict the
    outcome of these efforts, which could result in a decrease in
    amounts available

and/or

an
    increase in our borrowing costs and negatively impact our
    financial performance.

Poor investment performance of pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting
    benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and
    results of operations.

Our costs of providing
    non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other
    postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of
    factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level
    of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding
    levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our
    required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The
    performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of
    assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations
    under our plans. We have significant benefit obligations and
    hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.
    These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield
    uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return
    rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and
    postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding
    requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans
    if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the
    foreseeable future. Additionally, our pension and postretirement
    benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest
    rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase,



potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.
    Also, if future increases in pension and postretirement benefit
    costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable
    from Detroit Edison or MichCon customers, the results of
    operations and financial position of our company could be
    negatively affected. Without sustained growth in the plan
    investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets,
    we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts
    of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material
    impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of
    operations.

If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to
    record a charge to earnings.

We annually review
    the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made
    by the Company for impairment. Factors that may be considered
    for purposes of this analysis include any change in
    circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill
    may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and
    market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth
    rates in our industry. We cannot predict the timing, strength or
    duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery,
    worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate;
    however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the
    Company may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could
    potentially materially impact our results of operations and
    financial position.

Weather significantly affects
    operations.

Deviations from normal hot and cold
    weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow. Mild
    temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets,
    lowering income and cash flow. Ice storms, tornadoes, or high
    winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure
    and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material
    unplanned expenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts
    may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.

Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to
    risk.

Ownership of an operating nuclear
    generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks.
    These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental
    regulation and remediation, and operational factors that can
    significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a
    nuclear facility. While we maintain insurance for various
    nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such
    insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of
    an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating
    plant, which may affect our financial performance.

Construction and capital improvements to our power facilities
    subject us to risk.

We are managing ongoing and
    planning future significant construction and capital improvement
    projects at multiple power generation and distribution
    facilities. Many factors that could cause delay or increased
    prices for these complex projects are beyond our control,
    including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor
    performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits,
    construction disputes and weather conditions. Failure to
    complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason
    could adversely affect our financial performance and operations
    at the affected facilities.

The supply

and/or

price
    of energy commodities

and/or

related services may impact our financial
    results.

We are dependent on coal for much of our
    electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuations, fuel supply
    disruptions and increases in transportation costs could have a
    negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers
    for electricity and on the profitability of our non-utility
    businesses. Our access to natural gas supplies is critical to
    ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers. We
    have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in
    place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply
    prices, but there can be no assurances that our financial
    performance will not be negatively impacted by price
    fluctuations. The price of energy also impacts the market for
    our non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and
    alternative electric suppliers.

The supply

and/or

price
    of other industrial raw and finished inputs

and/or

related services may impact our financial
    results.

We are dependent on supplies of certain
    commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and
    industrial materials and services in order to maintain

day-to-day

operations and maintenance of our facilities. Price fluctuations
    or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items
    could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our
    customers for our utility products and on the profitability of
    our non-utility businesses.

Unplanned power plant outages may be
    costly.

Unforeseen maintenance may be required to
    safely produce electricity or comply with environmental
    regulations. As a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be
    required to



make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs
    of generation. Our financial performance may be negatively
    affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs.

Our estimates of gas reserves are subject to
    change.

While great care is exercised in
    utilizing historical information and assumptions to develop
    reasonable estimates of future production and cash flow, we
    cannot provide absolute assurance that our estimates of our
    Barnett gas reserves are accurate. We estimate proved gas
    reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those
    reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in
    estimating quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows
    attributable to such reserves, including factors beyond our
    control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of
    estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot be
    measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of an estimate of
    quantities of reserves, or of cash flows attributable to such
    reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions
    regarding expenditures for future development and exploration
    activities, and of engineering and geological interpretation and
    judgment. Additionally, reserves and future cash flows may be
    subject to material downward or upward revisions, based upon
    production history, development and exploration activities and
    prices of gas. Actual future production, revenue, taxes,
    development expenditures, operating expenses, quantities of
    recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such
    reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and
    underlying information we used.

Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be
    limited.

To reduce U.S. dependence on
    imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax
    credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and
    electricity from alternative sources. We have generated
    production tax credits from coke production, landfill gas
    recovery; biomass fired electric generation, reduced emission
    fuel, steel industry fuel and gas production operations. All
    production tax credits taken after 2008 are subject to audit by
    the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If our production tax
    credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an
    IRS audit, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for
    previously recognized tax credits that could significantly
    impact our earnings and cash flows.

We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.

DTE
    Energy is a holding company. Cash flows from our utility and
    non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses
    and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities. Should a major
    subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows
    to DTE Energy, our ability to pay interest and dividends would
    be restricted.

Renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs
    may affect our business.

We are subject to
    Michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation
    requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy. Under the
    current Michigan legislation we will be required in the future
    to provide a specified percentage of our power from Michigan
    renewable energy sources. We are developing a strategy for
    complying with the existing state legislation, but we do not
    know what requirements may be added by federal legislation. We
    are actively engaged in developing renewable energy projects and
    identifying third party projects in which we can invest. We
    cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with
    these future projects.

We are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy
    efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer
    awareness and education programs. These requirements necessitate
    expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the
    risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy
    usage. We do not know how these programs will impact our
    business and future operating results.

Threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our
    business.

We may be threatened by problems such
    as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations
    and could harm our operating results. Our industry requires the
    continued operation of sophisticated information technology
    systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation
    of security measures, all of our technology systems are
    vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses,
    acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information
    technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in
    a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business
    functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operating results, and financial condition.

In addition, our generation plants, gas pipeline and storage
    facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular
    may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our
    ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy
    products. We have increased security as a result of past events
    and we may be required by our regulators or by the future
    terrorist threat environment to make investments in security
    that we cannot currently predict.



Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to
    risk.

Events in the energy trading industry have
    increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business
    and the energy industry as a whole. In certain situations we may
    be required to post collateral to support trading operations,
    which could be substantial. If access to liquidity to support
    trading activities is curtailed, we could experience decreased
    earnings potential and cash flows. Energy trading activities
    take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to
    commodity price movements. We routinely have speculative trading
    positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines we set,
    resulting from the management of our business portfolio. To the
    extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating
    commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results
    and financial position. We manage our exposure by establishing
    and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.
    During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk
    management procedures may not work as planned and cannot
    eliminate all risks associated with these activities.

We may not be fully covered by insurance.

We
    have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide
    coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic
    damage as a result of acts of God, terrorism or a combination of
    other significant unforeseen events that could impact our
    operations. Economic losses might not be covered in full by
    insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual
    obligations.

Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable
    information could adversely affect us.

In
    connection with our business we collect and retain personally
    identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and
    employees. Our customers, shareholders and employees expect that
    we will adequately protect their personal information, and the
    United States regulatory environment surrounding information
    security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant
    theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee
    or DTE Energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely
    impact our reputation and could result in significant costs,
    fines and litigation.

A work interruption may adversely affect
    us.

Unions represent approximately 5,000 of our
    employees. A union choosing to strike would have an impact on
    our business. We are unable to predict the effect a work
    stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial
    performance.

Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and
    other skilled professional and technical employees could have an
    adverse effect on our operations.

Our business is
    dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate
    employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is
    high and the inability to retain and attract these employees
    could adversely affect our business and future operating results.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are involved in certain legal, regulatory, administrative and
    environmental proceedings before various courts, arbitration
    panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in
    the ordinary course of business. These proceedings include
    certain contract disputes, environmental reviews and
    investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and
    pending judicial matters. We cannot predict the final
    disposition of such proceedings. We regularly review legal
    matters and record provisions for claims that are considered
    probable of loss. The resolution of pending proceedings is not
    expected to have a material effect on our operations or
    financial statements in the periods they are resolved.

In February 2008, DTE Energy was named as one of approximately
    24 defendant oil, power and coal companies in a lawsuit filed in
    a United States District Court. DTE Energy was served with
    process in March 2008. The plaintiffs, the Native Village of
    Kivalina and City of Kivalina, which are home to approximately
    400 people in Alaska, claim that the defendants’
    business activities have contributed to global warming and, as a
    result, higher temperatures are damaging the local economy and
    leaving the island more vulnerable to storm activity in the fall
    and winter. As a result, the plaintiffs are seeking damages of
    up to $400 million for relocation costs associated with
    moving the village to a safer location, as well as unspecified
    attorney’s fees and expenses. On October 15, 2009, the
    U.S. District Court granted defendants’ motions
    dismissing all of plaintiffs’ federal claims in the case on
    two



independent grounds: (1) the court lacks subject matter
    jurisdiction to hear the claims because of the political
    question doctrine; and (2) plaintiffs lack standing to
    bring their claims. The court also dismissed plaintiffs’
    state law claims because the court lacked supplemental
    jurisdiction over them after it dismissed the federal claims;
    the dismissal of the state law claims was without prejudice. The
    plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the Ninth Circuit.

In July 2009, DTE Energy received a Notice of Violation/Finding
    of Violation (NOV/FOV) from the EPA alleging, among other
    things, that five of Detroit Edison’s power plants violated
    New Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration requirements, and operating permit requirements
    under the Clean Air Act. In June 2010, the EPA issued a NOV/FOV
    making similar allegations related to a recent project and
    outage at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant.

On August 5, 2010, the United States Department of Justice,
    at the request of the EPA, brought a civil suit in the
    U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
    against DTE Energy and Detroit Edison, related to the
    June 2010 NOV/FOV and the outage work performed at Unit 2
    of the Monroe Power Plant, but not relating to the July 2009
    NOV/FOV. Among other relief, the EPA requested the court to
    require Detroit Edison to install and operate the best available
    control technology at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant. Further,
    the EPA requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to
    require Detroit Edison to (i) begin the process of
    obtaining the necessary permits for the Monroe Unit 2
    modification and (ii) offset the pollution from Monroe Unit
    2 through emissions reductions from Detroit Edison’s fleet
    of coal-fired power plants until the new control equipment is
    operating. In January 2011, the EPA’s motion for
    preliminary injunction was denied and the liability phase of the
    civil suit has been scheduled for trial in May 2011.

DTE Energy and Detroit Edison believe that the plants identified
    by the EPA, including Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant, have
    complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations.
    Depending upon the outcome of discussions with the EPA regarding
    the NOV/FOV and the result of the civil action, Detroit Edison
    could also be required to install additional pollution control
    equipment at some or all of the power plants in question,
    implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment
    is not economical, engage in supplemental environmental
    programs,

and/or

pay
    fines. DTE Energy and Detroit Edison cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of this matter, or the timing of its
    resolution.

In October 2010, the Company received a Notice of Violation from
    the MDNRE alleging that the Michigan coke battery facility
    violated the visible emission readings and quench water sampling
    requirements under applicable National Emissions Standards for
    Hazardous Air Pollutants regulations. This Notice of Violation
    resulted from the Company self reporting to the MDNRE and the
    EPA questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired
    by the Company to perform visible emissions readings and quench
    water sampling. The information provided by contractor was used
    by the Company in filing certain reports with the MDNRE and the
    EPA. The Company has ceased using the contractor for these
    activities, has retained a new certified contractor to perform
    the required activities and implemented standard operating
    procedures designed to prevent a reoccurrence of such a
    situation. At this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome
    or financial impact of this issue.

In December 2010, the Company received a Notice of Violation
    from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) alleging
    that effluent discharges from the Michigan coke battery facility
    violated the City of Detroit Ordinance, the General
    Pre-Treatment Standards and the terms of a Consent Judgment
    entered between the Company and the DWSD with respect to the
    Michigan coke battery facility in March 2009. The Company has
    settled similar alleged violations with respect to the Michigan
    coke battery facility with the DWSD in the past. The Company has
    installed a biological waste water treatment plant at the
    Michigan coke battery facility in accordance with the Consent
    Judgement that is designed to meet the effluent limitations and
    is in the process of optimizing plant performance to minimize
    any future excursions of the Ordinance and the General
    Pre-Treatment Standards. The DWSD has demanded payment of
    $176,000 in penalties in connection with the alleged violations.
    The Company is actively pursuing a settlement with DWSD, but we
    cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this matter.

In April 2006, the prior owners of the coke battery facility in
    Pennsylvania that the Company purchased in 2008 received a
    Notice of Violation/Finding of Violation from the EPA alleging
    violations of the lowest achievable emission rate requirements
    associated with visible emissions from the combustion stack,
    door leaks and charging activities at the coke battery facility.
    The EPA has also alleged certain violations of the Clean Water
    Act, but has not



issued a notice of violation in connection with these alleged
    violations. The Company is in the process of negotiating a
    Consent Order with the EPA to settle these historic air and
    water issues. The Company will be required to complete ceramic
    welding repairs to the coke battery facility and to make repairs
    to the waste water treatment facility at the coke battery
    facility. The Company will also be required to pay a fine in
    connection with the settlement of these historic violations. At
    this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome or financial
    impact of this settlement or the timing of its resolution.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

DTE Energy is a diversified energy company with 2010 operating
    revenues in excess of $8 billion and approximately
    $25 billion in assets. We are the parent company of Detroit
    Edison and MichCon, regulated electric and gas utilities engaged
    primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural
    gas sales, distribution and storage services throughout
    southeastern Michigan. We operate four energy-related
    non-utility segments with operations throughout the United
    States.

The following table summarizes our financial results:

The increase in 2010 Net income attributable to DTE Energy as
    compared to 2009 was primarily due to improved results in the
    Electric and Gas Utilities and in the Power and Industrial
    Projects segment, partially offset by lower earnings in Energy
    Trading. The decrease in Net income attributable to DTE Energy
    in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to an $80 million
    after-tax gain recorded in the Unconventional Gas Production
    segment on the 2008 sale of a portion of Barnett shale
    properties, partially offset by higher earnings in the Electric
    Utility and Energy Trading segments.

The items discussed below influenced our current financial
    performance

UTILITY
    OPERATIONS

Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison, which
    is engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution and sale of
    electricity to approximately 2.1 million customers in
    southeastern Michigan.

Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens.
    MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage, transportation,
    gathering, distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately
    1.2 million customers throughout Michigan. Citizens
    distributes natural gas in Adrian, Michigan to approximately
    17,000 customers.

Detroit Edison has experienced decreased electric sales in 2010
    driven primarily by a decrease in commercial sales, partially
    offset by higher residential and industrial sales. Commercial
    sales continue to be lower due primarily to customers
    participating in the electric Customer Choice program. The
    residential sales increase is a result of warmer summer weather.
    Industrial sales are higher due to increased demand from
    customers in the automotive and steel industries and their
    related suppliers and other ancillary businesses. The impact of
    customers participating in the electric Customer Choice program
    is mitigated by the CIM, an over/under recovery mechanism which
    measures non-fuel revenues that are lost or gained as a result
    of fluctuations in electric Customer Choice sales. If annual
    electric Customer Choice sales exceed the baseline amount from
    Detroit Edison’s most recent rate case, 90 percent



of its lost non-fuel revenues associated with sales above that
    level may be recovered from full service customers. If annual
    electric Customer Choice sales decrease below the baseline, the
    Company must refund 90 percent of its increase in non-fuel
    revenues associated with sales below that level to full service
    customers. MichCon’s sales were lower due primarily to a
    decrease in the number of customers, reduced natural gas usage
    by customers due to economic conditions and an increased
    emphasis on conservation of energy usage.

We have RDMs in place at both utilities. The RDMs are designed
    to minimize the impact on revenues of changes in average
    customer usage of electricity and natural gas. The January 2010
    MPSC order in Detroit Edison’s 2009 rate case provided for,
    among other items, the implementation of a pilot electric RDM
    effective February 1, 2010. The electric RDM enables
    Detroit Edison to recover or refund the change in revenue
    resulting from the difference between actual average sales per
    customer compared to the base level of average sales per
    customer established in the MPSC order. The June 2010 MPSC order
    in MichCon’s 2009 rate case provided for, among other
    items, the implementation of a pilot gas RDM effective
    July 1, 2010. The gas RDM enables MichCon to recover or
    refund the change in revenue resulting from the difference in
    weather-adjusted average sales per customer compared to the base
    average sales per customer established in the MPSC order. The
    RDMs for Detroit Edison and MichCon address changes in customer
    usage due to general economic conditions and conservation, but
    do not shield the utilities from the impacts of lost customers.
    In addition, the pilot electric RDM materially shields Detroit
    Edison from the impact of weather on customer usage. The pilot
    gas RDM does not shield MichCon from the impact of weather on
    customer usage. The electric and gas RDMs are subject to review
    by the MPSC after the initial one-year pilot programs.

Both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due
    receivables primarily attributable to economic conditions. Our
    service territories continue to experience high levels of
    unemployment, underemployment and low income households, home
    foreclosures and a lack of adequate levels of assistance for
    low-income customers. We have taken actions to manage the level
    of past due receivables, including customer assistance forums,
    contracting with collection agencies, working with Michigan
    officials and others to increase the share of low-income funding
    allocated to our customers, and increasing customer
    disconnections. As a result of actions taken to manage the level
    of past due receivables, arrears were reduced in 2010 in our
    electric and gas utilities. Detroit Edison has an uncollectible
    expense tracking mechanism that enables it to recover or refund
    80 percent of the difference between the actual
    uncollectible expense for each year and the $66 million
    level reflected in base rates. In the June 2010 MPSC rate order,
    the base amount of MichCon’s uncollectible expense tracking
    mechanism was increased prospectively from $37 million to
    $70 million and MichCon’s portion of recovery or
    refund of the expenses above or below the base amount was
    modified to 80 percent from 90 percent. The Detroit
    Edison and MichCon uncollectible tracking mechanisms require
    annual reconciliation proceedings before the MPSC.

We are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to
    improve cash flow at our utility operations through working
    capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing
    and extent of our long-term capital projects. We are actively
    managing our cash, capital expenditures, cost structure and
    liquidity to maintain our financial strength. See the Capital
    Resources and Liquidity section in this Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of our liquidity
    outlook.

NON-UTILITY
    OPERATIONS

We have significant investments in non-utility businesses. We
    employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing
    opportunities that leverage our assets, skills and expertise.
    Specifically, we invest in targeted energy markets with
    attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in
    alignment with our risk profile. We expect growth opportunities
    in the Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power and Industrial
    Projects segments in the future. Expansion of these businesses
    will also result in our ability to further diversify
    geographically.



Gas Storage and Pipelines owns partnership interests in two
    natural gas storage fields and two interstate pipelines serving
    the Midwest, Ontario and Northeast markets. Much of the growth
    in demand for natural gas is expected to occur in the Eastern
    Canada and the Northeast U.S. regions. Our Vector and
    Millennium pipelines are well positioned to provide access
    routes and low-cost expansion options to these markets. In
    addition, Millennium Pipeline is well positioned for growth
    related to the Marcellus shale, especially with respect to
    Marcellus production in Northern Pennsylvania and along the
    southern tier of New York.

Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural
    gas and oil exploration, development and production primarily
    within the Barnett shale in north Texas. Our acreage covers an
    area that produces high Btu gas which provides a significant
    contribution to revenues from the value of natural gas liquids
    extracted from the gas stream. During this period of low natural
    gas prices, these natural gas liquids, with prices correlated to
    crude oil prices, have provided a significant increase to our
    realized wellhead price. Our drilling efforts have and will
    continue to target liquids rich gas and oil producing locations.
    We continue to develop our holdings and to seek opportunities
    for additional monetization of select properties, when
    conditions are appropriate.

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects
    that deliver energy and products and services to industrial,
    commercial and institutional customers; provide coal
    transportation, marketing and trading services; and sell
    electricity from biomass-fired energy projects. This business
    segment provides services using project assets usually located
    on or near the customers’ premises in the steel,
    automotive, pulp and paper, airport and other industries.
    Renewable energy, environmental and economic trends are creating
    growth opportunities. The increasing number of states with
    renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency mandates
    provides the opportunity to market the expertise of the Power
    and Industrial Projects segment in renewable power generation,
    landfill gas recovery, reduced emission fuel and other related
    services.

Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas
    marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of
    returns from DTE Energy’s asset portfolio, and optimization
    of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage,
    and power transmission and generating capacity positions. Energy
    Trading also provides natural gas, power and ancillary services
    to various utilities which may include the management of
    associated storage and transportation contracts on the
    customers’ behalf.

Our utility businesses require significant capital investments
    each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of
    their asset bases, including power generation plants,
    distribution systems, storage fields and other facilities and
    fleets. For both Detroit Edison and MichCon we plan to seek
    regulatory approval in general rate case filings to include
    these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base
    consistent with prior general rate case filing treatment.
    Detroit Edison is required to implement a

20-year

renewable energy plan to address the provisions of Michigan
    Public Act 295 of 2008, with the goals of delivering cleaner
    renewable electric generation to its customers, further
    diversifying Detroit Edison’s and the State of
    Michigan’s sources of electric supply and addressing the
    state and national goals of increasing energy independence.
    Detroit Edison will seek separate regulatory approval and
    recovery of these renewable capital expenditures within our
    regulatory rate base through our renewable energy plan filings.

In April 2010, the Company signed an agreement with the
    U.S. Department of Energy for a grant of approximately
    $84 million in matching funds on total anticipated spending
    of approximately $168 million related to the accelerated
    deployment of smart grid technology in Michigan through 2012.
    The smart grid technology includes



the establishment of an advanced metering infrastructure and
    other technologies that address improved electric distribution
    service. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Non-utility investments are expected primarily in continued
    investment in gas storage and pipeline assets and renewable
    opportunities in the Power and Industrial Projects businesses.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

We are subject to extensive environmental regulation. Additional
    costs may result as the effects of various substances on the
    environment are studied and governmental regulations are
    developed and implemented. Actual costs to comply could vary
    substantially. We expect to continue recovering environmental
    costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our
    customers.

Air —

Detroit Edison is subject to the EPA
    ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant
    emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Since 2005, the
    EPA and the State of Michigan have issued additional emission
    reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate,
    regional haze and mercury air pollution. The new rules will lead
    to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
    nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. To comply
    with these requirements, Detroit Edison has spent approximately
    $1.5 billion through 2010. The Company estimates Detroit
    Edison will make capital expenditures of over $230 million
    in 2011 and up to $2.1 billion of additional capital
    expenditures through 2020 based on current regulations. Further,
    additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years
    which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide,
    nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants. It is not possible
    to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this
    time.

In July 2009, DTE Energy received a Notice of Violation/Finding
    of Violation (NOV/FOV) from the EPA alleging, among other
    things, that five Detroit Edison power plants violated New
    Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration requirements, and operating permit requirements
    under the Clean Air Act. An additional NOV/FOV was received in
    June 2010 related to a recent project and outage at Unit 2 of
    the Monroe Power Plant.

On August 5, 2010, the United States Department of Justice,
    at the request of the EPA, brought a civil suit in the
    U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
    against DTE Energy and Detroit Edison, related to the June 2010
    NOV/FOV and the outage work performed at Unit 2 of the Monroe
    Power Plant, but not relating to the July 2009 NOV/FOV. Among
    other relief, the EPA requested the court to require Detroit
    Edison to install and operate the best available control
    technology at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant. Further, the EPA
    requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to require
    Detroit Edison to (i) begin the process of obtaining the
    necessary permits for the Monroe Unit 2 modification and
    (ii) offset the pollution from Monroe Unit 2 through
    emissions reductions from Detroit Edison’s fleet of
    coal-fired power plants until the new control equipment is
    operating. In January 2011, the EPA’s motion for
    preliminary injunction was denied and the liability phase of the
    civil suit has been scheduled for trial in May 2011.

DTE Energy and Detroit Edison believe that the plants identified
    by the EPA, including Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant, have
    complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations.
    Depending upon the outcome of discussions with the EPA regarding
    the NOV/FOV and the result of the civil action, the Company
    could also be required to install additional pollution control
    equipment at some or all of the power plants in question,
    implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment
    is not economical, engage in supplemental environmental
    programs,

and/or

pay
    fines. The Company cannot predict the financial impact or
    outcome of this matter, or the timing of its resolution.

Water

— In response to an EPA regulation,
    Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing
    the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures
    at several of its facilities. Based on the results of completed
    studies and expected future studies, Detroit Edison may be
    required to install additional control technologies to reduce
    the impacts of the water intakes. Initially, it was estimated
    that Detroit Edison could incur up to approximately
    $55 million in additional capital expenditures over the
    four to six years subsequent to 2008 to comply with these
    requirements. However, a January 2007 circuit court decision
    remanded back to the EPA several provisions of the federal
    regulation that has resulted in a delay in compliance dates. The
    decision also raised the



possibility that Detroit Edison may have to install cooling
    towers at some facilities at a cost substantially greater than
    was initially estimated for other mitigative technologies. In
    2008, the Supreme Court agreed to review the remanded
    cost-benefit analysis provision of the rule and in April 2009
    upheld the EPA’s use of this provision in determining best
    technology available for reducing environmental impacts. The EPA
    continues to develop a revised rule, a draft of which is
    expected to be published in the first quarter of 2011, with a
    final rule scheduled for mid-2012. The EPA has also issued an
    information collection request to begin a review of steam
    electric effluent guidelines. It is not possible at this time to
    quantify the impacts of these developing requirements.

Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) and Other Sites —

Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas
    pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured
    locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. The
    facilities, which produced gas, have been designated as MGP
    sites. Gas Utility owns, or previously owned, fifteen such
    former MGP sites. Detroit Edison owns, or previously owned,
    three former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP sites, we are
    also in the process of cleaning up other sites where
    contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing
    utility operations. These other sites include an engineered ash
    storage facility, electrical distribution substations, gas
    pipelines, and underground and aboveground storage tank
    locations. Cleanup activities associated with these sites will
    be conducted over the next several years.

Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation
    techniques, nature and extent of contamination and regulatory
    requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs
    for the sites and affect the Company’s financial position
    and cash flows. The Company anticipates the cost amortization
    methodology approved by the MPSC for MichCon, which allows
    MichCon to amortize the MGP costs over a ten-year period
    beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs
    were incurred, and the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism
    for Citizens Fuel Gas approved by the City of Adrian, will
    prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse
    impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Landfill

— Detroit Edison owns and operates a
    permitted engineered ash storage facility at the Monroe Power
    Plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant.
    Detroit Edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and
    identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and
    reconstruction.

The EPA has published proposed rules to regulate coal ash under
    the authority of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act
    (RCRA). The proposed rule published on June 21, 2010
    contains two primary regulatory options to regulate coal ash
    residue. The EPA is currently considering either, to designate
    coal ash as a “Hazardous Waste” as defined by RCRA or
    to regulate coal ash as non- hazardous waste under RCRA.
    However, agencies and legislatures have urged the EPA to
    regulate coal ash as a non-hazardous waste. If the EPA were to
    designate coal ash as a hazardous waste, the agency could apply
    some, or all, of the disposal and reuse standards that have been
    applied to other existing hazardous wastes. Some of the
    regulatory actions currently being contemplated could have a
    significant impact on our operations and financial position and
    the rates we charge our customers. It is not possible to
    quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this time.

Non-Utility

The Company’s non-utility affiliates are subject to a
    number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the
    protection of the environment from various pollutants.

The Michigan coke battery facility received and responded to
    information requests from the EPA that resulted in the issuance
    of a Notice of Violation in June of 2007 alleging potential
    maximum achievable control technologies and new source review
    violations. The EPA is in the process of reviewing the
    Company’s position of demonstrated compliance and has not
    initiated escalated enforcement. At this time, the Company
    cannot predict the impact of this issue. Furthermore, the
    Michigan coke battery facility is the subject of an
    investigation by the MDNRE concerning visible emissions readings
    that resulted from the Company self reporting to MDNRE
    questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired by
    the Company to perform the visible emissions readings. At this
    time, the Company cannot predict the impact of this
    investigation.

The Company is also in the process of settling historical air
    and water violations at its coke battery facility located in
    Pennsylvania. At this time, the Company cannot predict the
    impact of this settlement. The Company received two notices of
    violation from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
    Protection in 2010 alleging



violations of the permit for the Pennsylvania coke battery
    facility in connection with coal pile storm water runoff. The
    Company has implemented best management practices to address
    this issue and is currently seeking a permit from the
    Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to upgrade
    its wastewater treatment technology to a biological treatment
    facility. The Company expects to spend approximately
    $0.7 million on the existing waste water treatment system
    to comply with existing water discharge requirements. The
    Company may spend an additional $13 million over the next
    few years to meet future regulatory requirements and gain other
    operational improvements/savings. The Company’s non-utility
    affiliates are substantially in compliance with all
    environmental requirements, other than as noted above.

Global
    Climate Change

Climate regulation

and/or

legislation is being proposed and discussed within the
    U.S. Congress and the EPA. Despite passage of a greenhouse
    gas cap and trade bill by the U.S. House in June 2009, the
    Senate has been unable to pass a similar climate bill. A
    greenhouse gas cap and trade program is not expected to be
    included in energy or climate bills to be considered by the
    112th Congress. Meanwhile, the EPA is beginning to implement
    regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act to address emission
    of greenhouse gases. The EPA regulation of greenhouse gases
    (GHGs) begins in 2011 requiring the best available control
    technology (BACT) for major sources or modifications to existing
    major sources that cause significant increases in GHG emissions.
    The impact of this rule is uncertain until BACT is better
    defined by the permitting agencies. Pending or future
    legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material
    impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we
    charge our customers. Impacts include expenditures for
    environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned,
    financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the
    purchase of emission offsets from market sources and the
    retirement of facilities where control equipment is not
    economical. We would seek to recover these incremental costs
    through increased rates charged to our utility customers.
    Increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources
    could also increase the economic viability of energy produced
    from renewable

and/or

nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the
    development of market-based trading of carbon offsets providing
    business opportunities for our utility and non-utility segments.
    It is not possible to quantify these impacts on DTE Energy or
    its customers at this time.

OUTLOOK

The next few years will be a period of rapid change for DTE
    Energy and for the energy industry. Our strong utility base,
    combined with our integrated non-utility operations, position us
    well for long-term growth.

Looking forward, we will focus on several areas that we expect
    will improve future performance:

•

improving Electric and Gas Utility customer satisfaction;

•

continuing to pursue regulatory stability and investment
    recovery for our utilities;

•

managing the growth of our utility asset base;

•

optimizing our cost structure across all business segments;

•

managing cash, capital and liquidity to maintain or improve our
    financial strength; and

•

investing in businesses that integrate our assets and leverage
    our skills and expertise.

We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses
    in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet
    our strategic, financial and risk criteria.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased
    $28 million in 2010 and decreased $45 million in 2009.
    The increase in 2010 is primarily due to higher restoration and
    line clearance expenses of $40 million, higher energy
    optimization and renewable energy expenses of $18 million,
    higher legal expenses of $15 million, partially offset by
    reduced uncollectible expenses of $20 million, lower
    generation expenses of $18 million and lower employee
    benefit-related expenses of $6 million. The decrease in
    2009 was primarily due to $71 million from continuous
    improvement initiatives and other cost reductions resulting in
    lower contract labor and outside services expense, information
    technology and other staff expenses, $14 million of lower
    employee benefit-related expenses, lower restoration and line
    clearance expenses of $12 million, $9 million of
    reduced uncollectible expenses and $6 million of reduced
    maintenance activities, partially offset by higher pension and
    health care costs of $54 million and $14 million of
    energy optimization and renewable energy expenses.



Depreciation and amortization

expense increased
    $5 million in 2010 and $101 million in 2009 due
    primarily to a higher depreciable base and increased
    amortization of regulatory assets.

Taxes other than income

were higher by $32 million
    in 2010 due primarily to a $30 million reduction in
    property tax expense in 2009 due to refunds received in
    settlement of appeals of assessments for prior years.

Outlook

— We continue to move forward in our
    efforts to improve the operating performance and cash flow of
    Detroit Edison. The 2010 MPSC order provided for an
    uncollectible expense tracking mechanism which financially
    assists in mitigating the impacts of economic conditions in our
    service territory and a revenue decoupling mechanism that
    addresses changes in average customer usage due to general
    economic conditions, weather and conservation. These and other
    tracking mechanisms and surcharges are expected to result in
    lower earnings volatility. We expect that our planned
    significant environmental and renewable expenditures will result
    in earnings growth. Looking forward, we face additional
    challenges, such as higher levels of capital spending,
    volatility in prices for coal and other commodities, increased
    transportation costs, investment returns and changes in discount
    rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs, lower
    levels of wholesale sales due to contract expirations, and
    uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding
    climate change. We expect to continue our continuous improvement
    efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while
    improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer
    rate affordability.

Operation and maintenance

expense decreased
    $37 million in 2010 and $49 million in 2009. The
    decrease in 2010 is primarily due to reduced uncollectible
    expenses of $35 million and the deferral of
    $32 million of previously expensed CTA restructuring
    expenses, partially offset by higher maintenance expenses of
    $11 million, increased energy optimization expenses of
    $9 million, higher employee benefit-related expenses of
    $3 million and expense of $3 million for contributions
    to the Low Income Energy Efficiency Fund. The decrease in 2009
    was primarily due to $33 million of reduced uncollectible
    expenses, $15 million of lower employee benefit-related
    expenses, $14 million from continuous improvement
    initiatives and other cost reductions resulting in lower
    contract labor and outside services expense, information
    technology and other staff expenses, partially offset by higher
    health care expenses of $8 million and $4 million of
    energy optimization expenses. See Note 12 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Depreciation and amortization

expense decreased
    $15 million in 2010 due to the March 2010 MPSC order that
    reduced MichCon’s depreciation rates effective
    April 1, 2010.

Asset (gains) losses, net

decreased $18 million due
    to 2009 gains on the sale of base gas and the sale of certain
    gathering and processing assets.

Outlook —

We continue to move forward in our
    efforts to improve the operating performance and cash flow of
    Gas Utility. Unfavorable economic trends have resulted in a
    decrease in the number of customers in our service territory,
    increased customer conservation and continued high levels of
    theft and uncollectible accounts receivable. The MPSC has
    provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism which
    assists in mitigating the impacts of economic conditions in our
    service territory and a revenue decoupling mechanism that
    addresses changes in average customer usage due to general
    economic conditions and conservation. These and other tracking
    mechanisms and surcharges are expected to result in lower
    earnings volatility in the future. Looking forward, we face
    additional issues, such as volatility in gas prices, investment
    returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit
    plans and health care costs. We expect to continue an intense
    focus on our continuous improvement efforts to improve
    productivity, minimize lost and stolen gas, and decrease our
    costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration
    of customer rate affordability.

Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy

$


$


$


Net income attributable to DTE Energy increased $2 million
    and $11 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2010
    increase was driven by higher gas storage revenues and lower
    project development costs. The 2009 increase was driven by
    higher operating revenues resulting from increased capacity sold
    and higher rates from renewing storage contracts related to
    long-term agreements. In addition, in 2009 we had higher equity
    earnings from our investments in the Vector and Millennium
    Pipelines, reflecting a first full year of operations for
    Millennium.

Outlook —

Our Gas Storage and Pipelines
    business expects to continue its steady growth plan and is
    evaluating new pipeline and storage investment opportunities.

UNCONVENTIONAL
    GAS PRODUCTION

Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural
    gas and oil exploration, development and production within the
    Barnett shale in northern Texas. In January 2008, we sold a
    portion of our Barnett shale properties for gross proceeds of
    approximately $260 million. We recognized a gain of
    $128 million ($80 million after-tax) on the sale in
    2008.

Operating revenues

increased $1 million in 2010 as a
    result of higher commodity prices, and an increase in oil
    production. The 2009 decrease of $17 million was due to
    lower commodity prices realized for physical sales as well as a
    reduction in volumes hedged.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased
    $1 million in 2010 due to more wells on line and increased
    water handling cost. The decrease of $7 million in 2009 was
    due to operational efficiencies and lower costs for goods and
    services due to economic conditions.

Asset (gains) and losses, net

increased $4 million
    in 2010 and decreased $126 million in 2009. The increase in
    2010 was due to impairment of unproved leasehold positions that
    the Company does not intend to drill prior to expiration. The
    2009 decrease was due to the gain of $128 million
    ($80 million after-tax) on the 2008 sale of a portion of
    our Barnett shale properties and $2 million lower
    impairment in 2009 of expired or expiring leasehold positions
    that the Company did not intend to drill at then current
    commodity prices.

Outlook —

In the longer-term, we plan to
    continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the
    Barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional
    monetization of select properties when conditions are
    appropriate. Our strategy for 2011 is to maintain our focus on
    reducing operating expenses and optimizing production volume.
    Given the current outlook of low natural gas prices, drilling
    efforts will continue to target liquids rich gas and oil
    production. During 2011, we expect total capital investment of
    $25 million to drill approximately 20 new wells and
    continue to acquire select acreage and achieve production of
    approximately 6 Bcfe of natural gas, compared with

    INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects
    that deliver energy and utility-type products and services to
    industrial, commercial and institutional customers; provide coal
    transportation services and marketing; and sell electricity from
    biomass-fired energy projects.

VIEs

— As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 of
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective
    January 1, 2010, we adopted the provisions of ASU

2009-17,

Amendments to FASB Interpretation 46(R)

. ASU

2009-17

changed the methodology for determining the primary beneficiary
    of a VIE from a quantitative risk and rewards-based model to a
    qualitative determination. The Company re-evaluated prior VIE
    and primary beneficiary determinations and, as a result, began
    consolidating five entities. Since these entities were
    previously accounted for under the equity method, the VIE
    consolidation had no impact on Net Income Attributable to DTE
    Energy. As a



result of the consolidation of these VIEs, Operating Revenues
    and Operations and Maintenance expense increased
    $174 million and $122 million, respectively, in 2010.

Operating revenues

increased $309 million, net of
    VIE adjustments, in 2010 and decreased $326 million in
    2009. The 2010 increase is attributed primarily to
    $172 million of higher coke sales and a $156 million
    increase in

on-site

services, partially offset by a $18 million decrease in
    coal trading and transportation services. The 2009 decrease is
    due primarily to $111 million reduction in certain coal
    structured transactions, $176 million of lower pricing and
    volumes of coal and emissions and $84 million of lower coke
    demand, partially offset by a $107 million increase in coal
    related services.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased
    $262 million, net of VIE adjustments, in 2010 and decreased
    $306 million in 2009. The increase is due primarily to
    $118 million of higher coke production and a
    $154 million increase in

on-site

services, partially offset by $10 million of lower coal
    trading and transportation services. The 2009 decrease is due
    primarily to $111 million decrease in certain coal
    structured transactions and $64 million of lower coke
    demand, $141 million of lower pricing and volumes of coal
    and emissions and operating expenses, partially offset by
    $75 million of higher coal related services.

Asset (Gains) Losses

were higher by $8 million in
    2010 due primarily to the sale of DTE Rail Services and an
    increase in installment gains from the sale of a coke battery.

Other (income) and deductions

were lower by
    $14 million in 2010 and lower by $19 million in 2009.
    The decreases in both years were due primarily to lower equity
    earnings in various projects and higher intercompany interest
    associated with project investment.

Outlook

— We expect sustained production levels
    of metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to steel
    industry customers for 2011. Beginning in 2011, substantially
    all of the metallurgical coke is under long-term contracts. The
    tax credits associated with our steel industry fuels facilities
    expired at December 31, 2010 that will result in lower tax
    credits of approximately $29 million in 2011. We supply

on-site

energy services to the domestic automotive manufacturers who
    have also experienced stabilized demand for automobiles. Our

on-site

energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with
    the terms of long-term contracts.

In late 2009, we began operating reduced emission fuel
    facilities located at Detroit Edison owned coal-fired power
    plants. The facilities reduce Nitrogen Oxide (NO) and Mercury
    (Hg) emissions and qualify for production tax credits when the
    fuel is sold to an unrelated party through 2019. We continue to
    optimize these facilities by seeking investors for facilities
    operating at Detroit Edison sites and intend to relocate other
    facilities to alternative sites which may provide increased
    production and emission reduction opportunities in 2011 and
    future years. In January 2011, the Company entered into an
    agreement to sell a membership interest in one of these reduced
    emission fuel facilities that is located at a Detroit Edison
    site.

Environmental and economic trends are creating growth
    opportunities for renewable power. The increasing number of
    states with renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency
    mandates provides investment opportunity in waste-wood power
    generation. In addition to the three facilities in operation, we
    will convert and place into service two additional facilities in
    2011 and 2013. We will continue to look for additional
    investment opportunities for waste-wood renewable power
    generation and other energy projects at favorable prices.

Effective January 1, 2011, our existing long-term rail
    transportation contract, at rates significantly below the
    current market, expired and we anticipate a decrease in
    transportation-related revenue of approximately
    $130 million as a result. The decrease in revenue will be
    mostly offset by lower variable costs incurred to provide the
    transportation.

We will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to
    promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy
    requirements of our customers. Power and Industrial Projects
    will continue to leverage its extensive energy-related operating
    experience and project management capability to develop
    additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial
    customers.

ENERGY
    TRADING

Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas
    marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of
    returns from DTE Energy’s asset portfolio, and optimization
    of contracted natural gas



pipeline transportation and storage, and power transmission and
    generating capacity positions. Energy Trading also provides
    natural gas, power and ancillary services to various utilities
    which may include the management of associated storage and
    transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf.

Gross margin

decreased $112 million in 2010 and
    increased $48 million in 2009. The overall decrease in
    gross margin in 2010 was the result of lower economic
    performance, lower commodity prices, lower volatility in the
    markets we participate in and lower risk positions relative to
    2009, coupled with the absence of prior year timing-related
    gains. We experienced timing-related earnings volatility based
    on market movement related to derivative contracts.

The decrease in 2010 represents a $78 million decrease in
    realized margins and $34 million decrease in unrealized
    margins. The $78 million decrease in realized margins is
    due to $108 million of unfavorable results, primarily in
    our power and gas trading and gas full requirements strategies,
    offset by $30 million of favorable results, primarily in
    our power full requirements and power origination strategies.
    The $34 million decrease in unrealized margins is due to
    $56 million of unfavorable results, primarily in our power
    trading strategy and the absence of prior year timing-related
    gains related to our gas transportation strategy. These
    decreases were offset by $22 million of favorable results,
    primarily due to timing-related gains in our gas full
    requirements strategy.

The $48 million increase in gross margin in 2009 was due to
    increases in realized margins of $69 million, offset by
    decreases in unrealized margins of $21 million. The
    $69 million increase in realized margins was primarily the
    result of increases in our gas trading strategy and
    timing-related increases in our gas storage and gas
    transportation strategies. The $21 million decrease in
    unrealized margins consisted of unfavorable results of
    $58 million from our gas trading and gas storage
    strategies, partially offset by increases of $29 million
    primarily in our power trading strategy and timing-related
    improvements of $8 million in our oil strategies.

Operation and maintenance

expense decreased
    $12 million in 2010 and increased $3 million in 2009.
    The 2010 decrease was primarily due to lower incentive costs.
    The 2009 increase was due to higher payroll and incentive costs
    and commissions, partially offset by lower contractor expense
    and allocated corporate costs.

Income tax provision

decreased $32 million in 2010.
    This decrease is due to lower pretax income, partially offset by
    $10 million of favorable tax-related adjustments in 2009
    resulting from the settlement of federal income tax audits.
    Income taxes were higher by $6 million in 2009 due to
    higher pretax income, partially offset by the $10 million
    of favorable tax-related adjustments.

Outlook —

In the near term, we expect market
    conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this
    segment may be impacted by the volatility or lack thereof in
    commodity prices in the markets we participate in and the
    uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform,
    regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of regional
    transmission organizations.



The Energy Trading portfolio includes financial instruments,
    physical commodity contracts and gas inventory, as well as
    contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and
    power transmission and generation capacity positions. Energy
    Trading also provides natural gas, power and ancillary services
    to various utilities which may include the management of
    associated storage and transportation contracts on the
    customers’ behalf. Significant portions of the Energy
    Trading portfolio are economically hedged. Most financial
    instruments and physical power and gas contracts are deemed
    derivatives, whereas natural gas inventory, power transmission,
    pipeline transportation and certain storage assets are not
    derivatives. As a result, we will experience earnings volatility
    as derivatives are

marked-to-market

without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and
    assets. Our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of
    these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with
    futures, forwards, swaps and options. This results in gains and
    losses that are recognized in different interim and annual
    accounting periods.

See also the “Fair Value” section that follows.

CORPORATE &
    OTHER

Corporate & Other includes various holding company
    activities and holds certain non-utility debt and energy-related
    investments.

The 2010 net loss of $69 million was an improvement of
    $1 million from the 2009 net loss of $70 million.
    The net $1 million improvement was a result of the 2009
    donation to the DTE Energy Foundation of $10 million and
    lower impairments of investments of $3 million, partially
    offset by higher state and local taxes of $3 million,
    higher tax related interest of $5 million, increased
    financing costs of $5 million. The 2010 donation to the DTE
    Energy Foundation of $14 million was made by Detroit Edison
    and MichCon.

The 2009 net loss of $70 million decreased from the
    net loss of $94 million in 2008 due to $34 million
    favorable tax-related adjustments primarily resulting from the
    settlement of federal income tax audits, $10 million lower
    inter-company interest expense and $9 million lower costs
    related to natural gas forward contracts associated with the
    2007 sale of the Antrim Shale properties. These favorable
    variances were partially offset by a $10 million donation
    of cash and

available-for-sale

securities to the DTE Energy Foundation, $10 million
    resulting from a realignment of employee benefit expense from
    MichCon, $7 million increase in financing fees,
    $1 million increased impairment of investments and a
    $1 million decrease in interest income.

CUMULATIVE
    EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted ASC 820
    (SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements)

. The
    cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of ASC 820
    represented a $4 million increase to the January 1,
    2008 balance of retained earnings. See also the “Fair
    Value” section.

CAPITAL
    RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Cash
    Requirements

We use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas
    utilities and to grow our non-utility businesses, retire and pay
    interest on long-term debt and pay dividends. We believe that we
    will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to
    fund anticipated capital and operating requirements. In 2011, we
    expect that cash from operations will be $1.9 billion due
    to lower working capital requirements. We anticipate base level
    capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in
    2011 of up to $1.4 billion. The capital needs of our
    utilities will increase due primarily to environmental
    expenditures. We plan to seek regulatory approval to include
    these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base
    consistent with prior treatment. Capital spending for growth of



existing or new non-utility businesses will depend on the
    existence of opportunities that meet our strict risk-return and
    value creation criteria.

Cash
    from Operating Activities

A majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our
    electric and gas utilities, which are significantly influenced
    by factors such as weather, electric Customer Choice, regulatory
    deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions and
    operating costs.

Cash from operations totaling $1.8 billion in 2010 was
    consistent with the comparable 2009 period. The operating cash
    flow comparison primarily reflects higher net income after
    adjusting for non-cash and non-operating items (depreciation,
    depletion and amortization, deferred income taxes and gains on
    sales of assets), offset by higher working capital requirements.

Cash from operations totaling $1.8 billion in 2009,
    increased $260 million from the comparable 2008 period. The
    operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects lower working
    capital requirements and higher net income after adjusting for
    non-cash and non-operating items (depreciation, depletion and
    amortization, deferred income taxes and gains on sales of
    assets).

Cash
    from Investing Activities

Cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily
    generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are
    primarily generated from plant and equipment expenditures. In
    any given year, we will look to realize



cash from under-performing or non-strategic assets or matured
    fully valued assets. Capital spending within the utility
    business is primarily to maintain our generation and
    distribution infrastructure, comply with environmental
    regulations and gas pipeline replacements. Capital spending
    within our non-utility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and
    expansion. The balance of non-utility spending is for growth,
    which we manage very carefully. We look to make investments that
    meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills,
    risks and returns. All new investments are analyzed for their
    rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis. We
    have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make
    investments unless they meet our criteria. For new business
    lines, we initially invest based on research and analysis. We
    start with a limited investment, we evaluate results and either
    expand or exit the business based on those results. In any given
    year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the
    underlying cash flows of the Company with a clear understanding
    of any potential impact on our credit ratings.

Net cash used for investing activities was approximately
    $1.2 billion in 2010, compared with net cash used for
    investing activities of $1.1 billion in 2009. The change
    was primarily driven by increased capital expenditures by our
    utility and non-utility businesses.

Net cash used for investing activities was approximately
    $1.1 billion in 2009, compared with net cash used for
    investing activities of $1.5 billion in 2008. The change
    was primarily driven by reduced capital expenditures by our
    utility and non-utility businesses and the completion of refund
    payments to our synfuel partners in 2008.

Cash
    from Financing Activities

We rely on both short-term borrowing and long-term financing as
    a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied
    by our operations.

Our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed
    and variable interest rates and maturity. We continually
    evaluate our leverage target, which is currently 50% to 52%, to
    ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong
    investment grade debt rating.

Net cash used for financing activities was $586 million in
    2010, compared to net cash used for financing activities of
    approximately $789 million for the same period in 2009. The
    change was primarily attributable to decreased payments for
    short-term borrowings. Increases in issuances of long-term debt
    were offset by increased long-term debt redemptions.

Net cash used for financing activities was $789 million in
    2009, compared to net cash used for financing activities of
    approximately $84 million for the same period in 2008. The
    change was primarily attributable to lower proceeds from the
    issuance of long-term debt.

Outlook

We expect cash flow from operations to increase over the
    long-term primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and
    the non-utility businesses. We expect growth in our utilities to
    be driven primarily by new and existing state and federal
    regulations that will result in additional environmental and
    renewable energy investments which will increase the base from
    which rates are determined. Our non-utility growth is expected
    from additional investments in energy projects as economic
    conditions improve.

We may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries
    of our various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of
    timing of MPSC orders. Energy prices are likely to be a source
    of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for
    the foreseeable future. We are continuing our efforts to
    identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working
    capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing
    and extent of our long-term capital projects.

We have approximately $900 million in long-term debt
    maturing in the next twelve months. DTE Energy has
    $600 million of unsecured debt maturing in June 2011 which
    is expected to be funded through a combination of internally
    generated funds and short- term debt. Substantially all of the
    remaining debt maturities relate to Securitization and other
    Detroit Edison issues. The repayment of the principal amount of
    the Securitization debt is



funded through a surcharge payable by Detroit Edison’s
    electric customers. The repayment of the other Detroit Edison
    debt is expected to be refinanced with long-term debt.

In August 2010, DTE Energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
    Detroit Edison and MichCon, entered into amended and restated
    two-year $1 billion unsecured revolving credit agreements
    and new three-year $800 million unsecured revolving credit
    agreements with a syndicate of 23 banks that may be used for
    general corporate borrowings, but are intended to provide
    liquidity support for each of the companies’ commercial
    paper programs. No one bank provides more than 8.25% of the
    commitment in any facility. Borrowings under the facilities are
    available at prevailing short-term interest rates. DTE Energy
    has approximately $1.7 billion of available liquidity at
    December 31, 2010.

In March 2010, the PPACA and the HCERA were enacted into law
    (collectively, the “Act”). The Act is a comprehensive
    health care reform bill. A provision of the PPACA repeals the
    current rule permitting deduction of the portion of the drug
    coverage expense that is offset by the Medicare Part D
    subsidy, effective for taxable years beginning after
    December 31, 2012. We have initiated changes in benefit
    design and delivery and are continuing to evaluate alternatives
    to minimize the impact of the legislation. We contributed
    $200 million to our pension plans during the year ended
    December 31, 2010, including a DTE Energy stock
    contribution of $100 million in March 2010. We
    contributed $160 million to our postretirement medical and
    life insurance benefit plans during the year ended
    December 31, 2010, including a transfer of $25 million
    from the MichCon Grantor Trust. In January 2011, we contributed
    $200 million to our pension plans. Also, we contributed
    $81 million to our postretirement medical and life
    insurance plans in January 2011, and we expect to contribute up
    to an additional $90 million throughout the remainder of
    2011.

In July 2010, a federal financial reform act was signed into
    law. The legislation reshapes financial regulation and is
    intended to address specific issues that contributed to the
    financial crisis. Most major areas of the legislation will be
    dependent upon regulatory interpretation, rulemaking and
    implementation. We do not expect any material effect on our
    operations and financial position.

The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job
    Creation Act of 2010 provided for a special allowance for bonus
    depreciation in 2011 and 2012. Bonus depreciation is accelerated
    depreciation on certain types of business equipment that allows
    a tax deduction of either 50% or 100% of the cost of qualifying
    property in the year the asset is placed in service. DTE Energy
    expects to generate approximately $100 million to
    $200 million of cash in

2011-2012

from bonus depreciation deductions, a significant portion of
    which is expected to result from Detroit Edison property, plant
    and equipment expenditures during the qualifying period. The
    cash benefit is an acceleration of tax deductions that the
    Company would otherwise have received over 20 years.

We believe we have sufficient operating flexibility, cash
    resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of
    liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital
    expenditure needs. However, virtually all of our businesses are
    capital intensive, or require access to capital, and the
    inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact
    earnings and cash flows.

See Notes 12, 16, 18, and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Credit
    Ratings

Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market
    participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality
    of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities. The Company’s credit ratings affect our cost of
    capital and other terms of financing as well as our ability to
    access the credit and commercial paper markets. Management
    believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient
    access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the
    banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may
    affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an
    increase in the return required by investors.

As part of the normal course of business, Detroit Edison,
    MichCon and various non-utility subsidiaries of the Company
    routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts
    for the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal,
    capacity, storage and other energy-related products and
    services. Certain of these contracts contain provisions which
    allow the counterparties to request that the Company post cash
    or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt
    rating of DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade.
    Certain of these contracts for Detroit Edison and MichCon
    contain similar provisions in the event that the senior
    unsecured debt rating of the particular utility is downgraded
    below investment grade. The amount of such collateral which
    could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and
    the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and
    could be substantial. Also, upon a downgrade below investment
    grade, we could have restricted access to the commercial paper
    market and if DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade
    our non-utility businesses, especially the Energy Trading and
    Power and Industrial Projects segments, could be required to
    restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity. A
    downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the
    borrowing costs of DTE



Energy and its subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital
    markets. The impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability
    to comply with our existing debt covenants. While we currently
    do not anticipate such a downgrade, we cannot predict the
    outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews.

In January 2010, Standard & Poor’s Rating Group
    (Standard & Poor’s) revised the outlook on DTE
    Energy and its subsidiaries to stable from negative, and raised
    the short-term corporate credit and commercial paper ratings for
    DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon to ‘A-2’ from
    ‘A-3’. The revision was primarily due to the
    diminished possibility of a downgrade in light of the
    Company’s decreasing regulatory risk. We have experienced
    an improvement in our ability to issue commercial paper since
    the restoration of our short-term ratings. Short-term
    borrowings, principally in the form of commercial paper, provide
    us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis. Our commercial
    paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities.
    Potential instability in the credit markets and any lowering of
    ratings may impact future access to the commercial paper
    markets, which may require us to draw on our

back-up

facilities. In June 2010, Standard & Poor’s
    revised the outlook on DTE Energy and its subsidiaries to
    positive from stable. The outlook revision reflected the
    Company’s decreasing regulatory risk. In December 2010,
    Standard and Poor’s upgraded the corporate credit rating of
    DTE Energy and its utility subsidiaries to ‘BBB+’ from
    ‘BBB’ to reflect the company’s decreasing
    regulatory risk and improved financial measures. At the same
    time, Standard and Poor’s raised the rating on Detroit
    Edison’s senior secured debt to ‘A’ from
    ‘A-’ and raised the rating on MichCon’s senior
    secured debt to ‘A’ from ‘BBB+’. In January
    2011, Fitch Ratings revised the rating outlook for Detroit
    Edison to positive from stable due to improvement in its credit
    protection measures as a result of supportive regulatory
    policies in Michigan.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles require that management
    apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions
    that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and
    liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management
    believes that the areas described below require significant
    judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making
    estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently
    uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional
    discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this Report.

Regulation

A significant portion of our business is subject to regulation.
    This results in differences in the application of generally
    accepted accounting principles between regulated and
    non-regulated businesses. Detroit Edison and MichCon are
    required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain
    transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense
    in non-regulated businesses. Future regulatory changes or
    changes in the competitive environment could result in the
    discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory
    assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses.
    Management believes that currently available facts support the
    continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all
    regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable
    in the current rate environment.

In March 2010, the PPACA and the HCERA were enacted into law
    (collectively, the “Act”). A provision of the PPACA
    repeals the current rule permitting deduction of the portion of
    the drug coverage expense that is offset by the Medicare
    Part D subsidy, effective for taxable years beginning after
    December 31, 2012. This change in tax law required a
    remeasurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Other
    Postretirement Benefit Obligation (OPEB) and the deferred tax
    liability related to the OPEB Regulatory Asset. Income tax
    accounting rules require the impact of a change in tax law be
    recognized in continuing operations in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations in the period that the tax law change
    is enacted. However, regulated businesses may defer changes in
    tax law if allowed by regulators. The MPSC’s historical
    practice has been to recognize both the expense and working
    capital impacts for OPEB costs. In addition, the current and
    deferred tax effects related to OPEB costs have been recognized
    consistently. The effects of the subsidy have been reflected
    through lower tax expense included in rates. We believe we have
    reasonable assurance that the impacts related to the enactment
    of the Act are recoverable through rates in future periods.
    Therefore, the amounts related to Detroit Edison of
    $18 million and MichCon of $4 million have been
    deferred as Regulatory Assets.

See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.



Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as
    Derivative Assets or Liabilities. Changes in the fair value of
    the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the
    period of change, unless the derivative meets certain defined
    conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge. The normal
    purchases and normal sales exception requires, among other
    things, physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or
    sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business.
    Contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal
    sales are not recorded at fair value. Substantially all of the
    commodity contracts entered into by Detroit Edison and MichCon
    meet the criteria specified for this exception.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date
    in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a
    market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs,
    which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use
    in pricing assets and liabilities. These inputs can be readily
    observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable
    inputs. Management makes certain assumptions it believes that
    market participants would use in pricing assets and liabilities,
    including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the
    inputs to valuation techniques. Credit risk of the Company and
    our counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of the
    assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the
    impact of which was immaterial at December 31, 2010 and
    2009. Management believes it uses valuation techniques that
    maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and minimize
    the use of unobservable inputs.

The fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change
    significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new
    information. Actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may
    be different from the results we estimate using models. As fair
    value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity
    prices, we perform sensitivity analysis on the fair values of
    our forward contracts. See sensitivity analysis in Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See
    also the Fair Value section, herein. See Notes 4 and 5 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this report.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on
    historical losses and management’s assessment of existing
    economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. The
    allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is
    calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates
    developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past
    due receivable balances. As a result of the reduction in past
    due receivables in 2010, our allowance for doubtful accounts
    decreased significantly from the 2009 balance. We believe the
    allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable
    estimates. As part of the 2005 gas rate order for MichCon, the
    MPSC provided for the establishment of an uncollectible expense
    tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact
    associated with MichCon uncollectible expenses. The MPSC
    provided for a similar tracking mechanism for Detroit Edison in
    its rate order received January 2010. Detroit Edison filed for
    the suspension of the tracking mechanism effective with the
    order in its pending rate case.

Asset
    Impairments

Goodwill

Certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated
    goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations. We
    perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with
    goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate
    that the value of goodwill may be impaired. In performing Step 1
    of the impairment test, we compare the fair value of the
    reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. If the
    carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value
    of a reporting unit, Step 2 of the test would be performed. Step
    2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill
    to be reduced to its fair value, if lower, as of the test date.

For Step 1 of the test, we estimate the reporting unit’s
    fair value using standard valuation techniques, including
    techniques which use estimates of projected future results and
    cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. Such
    techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an
    earnings multiple approach, which incorporates the current
    market values of comparable entities. These cash flow valuations
    involve a number of estimates that require



broad assumptions and significant judgment by management
    regarding future performance. We also employ market-based
    valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the
    indications of value for the reporting units determined under
    the cash flow technique.

We performed our annual impairment test as of October 1,
    2010 and determined that except for the Coal Services reporting
    unit, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded
    its carrying value, and no impairment existed. The
    $4 million of goodwill attributable to the Coal Services
    reporting unit was written off in the fourth quarter of 2010 in
    connection with the sale of rail services assets. We also
    compared the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our
    overall market capitalization. The implied premium of the
    aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely
    attributable to an acquisition control premium (the price in
    excess of a stock’s market price that investors typically
    pay to gain control of an entity). The results of the test and
    key estimates that were incorporated are as follows.

The Gas Utility reporting unit passed Step 1 of the impairment
    test by a 7% margin. A substantive decrease in market multiples,
    negative regulatory actions or other disruptions in cash flows
    for the Gas Utility reporting unit could result in an impairment
    charge in the foreseeable future. For example, at the current
    discount rate and holding all other variables constant, a 0.5x
    decrease in the terminal multiple would lower the fair value by
    approximately $130 million. At the lower fair value, the
    Gas Utility reporting unit would likely fail Step 1 of the test
    potentially resulting in a charge for impairment of goodwill
    following completion of the Step 2 analysis.

We perform an annual impairment test each October. In between
    annual tests, we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding
    estimated future cash flows, including the impact of movements
    in market indicators in future quarters and will update our
    impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs. While we
    believe our assumptions are reasonable, actual results may
    differ from our projections. To the extent projected results or
    cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be
    required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill, which
    would adversely impact our earnings.



Long-Lived
    Assets

We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets,
    excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable.
    Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows
    and fair value of the long-lived assets are deteriorating
    business climate, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of
    the asset before the end of its useful life. The review of
    long-lived assets for impairment requires significant
    assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future
    cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected
    market conditions. An impairment evaluation is based on an
    undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which
    independent cash flows of long-lived assets can be identified
    from other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment may
    occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future
    undiscounted cash flows. When the undiscounted cash flow
    analysis indicates a long-lived asset is not recoverable, the
    amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the
    excess of the long-lived asset over its fair value. An
    impairment would require us to reduce both the long-lived asset
    and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment,
    which would adversely impact our earnings. See Note 11 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this Report.

Pension
    and Postretirement Costs

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement
    benefit plans for substantially all of the employees of the
    Company. The measurement of the plan obligations and cost of
    providing benefits under these plans involve various factors,
    including numerous assumptions and accounting elections. When
    determining the various assumptions that are required, we
    consider historical information as well as future expectations.
    The benefit costs are affected by, among other things, the
    actual rate of return on plan assets, the long-term expected
    return on plan assets, the discount rate applied to benefit
    obligations, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining
    service period of plan participants, level of compensation and
    rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service,
    the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs and the
    level of benefits provided to employees and retirees. Pension
    and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are
    included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects
    within the segments, some of which are capitalized.

We had pension costs for pension plans of $112 million in
    2010, $58 million in 2009, and $24 million in 2008.
    Postretirement benefits costs for all plans were
    $164 million in 2010, $205 million in 2009 and
    $142 million in 2008. Pension and postretirement benefits
    costs for 2010 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial
    assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on
    our plan assets of 8.75%. In developing our expected long-term
    rate of return assumptions, we evaluated asset class risk and
    return expectations, as well as inflation assumptions. Projected
    returns are based on broad equity, bond and other markets. Our
    2011 expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is
    based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active
    investment management of 47% in equity markets, 25% in fixed
    income markets, and 28% invested in other assets. Because of
    market volatility, we periodically review our asset allocation
    and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate. Given
    market conditions, we are lowering our long-term rate of return
    assumption for our pension plans to 8.50% for 2011. Our
    long-term rate of return assumption for our postretirement
    health and life plans will remain at 8.75% for 2011. We believe
    these two rates are reasonable assumptions for the long-term
    rate of return on our plan assets for 2011 given our investment
    strategy. We will continue to evaluate our actuarial
    assumptions, including our expected rate of return, at least
    annually.

We calculate the expected return on pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected
    return on plan assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan
    assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration
    anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be
    made during the year. Current accounting rules provide that the
    MRV of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated
    value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and
    rational manner over not more than five years. For our pension
    plans, we use a calculated value when determining the MRV of the
    pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a
    three-year period. Accordingly, the future value of assets will
    be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are
    recognized. Financial markets in 2010 contributed to our
    investment performance resulting in unrecognized net gains. As
    of December 31, 2010, we had $242 million of
    cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the
    calculation of the MRV of pension assets. For our postretirement
    benefit plans, we use fair value when



determining the MRV of postretirement benefit plan assets,
    therefore all investment losses and gains have been recognized
    in the calculation of MRV for these plans.

The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension
    and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve
    approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two
    highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. The yield
    curve approach matches projected pension plan and postretirement
    benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual
    liability duration unique to our plans. The discount rate
    determined on this basis decreased to 5.5% at December 31,
    2010 from 5.9% at December 31, 2009. We estimate that our
    2011 total pension costs will approximate $167 million
    compared to $112 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower
    discount rate, partially offset by better than expected asset
    returns in 2010 and 2011 contributions. Our 2011 postretirement
    benefit costs will approximate $137 million compared to
    $164 million in 2010 primarily due to changing our strategy
    for providing post-65 prescription drug benefits to retirees,
    better than expected asset returns in 2010 and favorable retiree
    medical utilization. These positive impacts were partially
    offset by a lower discount rate and updated assumed long-term
    retiree medical inflation. Our health care trend rate assumes 7%
    for 2011 through 2015, 6.5% in 2016, 6% in 2017, 5.5% in 2018
    and 5% in 2019 and beyond. Future actual pension and
    postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment
    performance, changes in future discount rates and various other
    factors related to plan design. The pension cost tracking
    mechanism that provided for recovery or refunding of pension
    costs above or below amounts reflected in Detroit Edison’s
    base rates, at the request of Detroit Edison, was not
    reauthorized by the MPSC in its rate order effective
    January 1, 2009. The MPSC approved the deferral of the
    non-capitalized portion of MichCon’s negative pension
    expense. MichCon records a regulatory liability for any negative
    pension costs, as determined under generally accepted accounting
    principles.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on our plan
    assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2010
    pension costs by approximately $30 million. Lowering the
    discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one
    percentage point would have increased our 2010 pension costs by
    approximately $10 million. Lowering the health care cost
    trend assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased
    our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2010
    by approximately $25 million.

The value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets
    was $3.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and
    $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009. At
    December 31, 2010 our pension plans were underfunded by
    $872 million and our other postretirement benefit plans
    were underfunded by $1.3 billion. The 2010 and 2009 funding
    levels were generally similar due to positive investment
    performance returns and plan sponsor contributions in 2010 and
    2009, largely offset by the decreased discount rates.

Pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding
    requirements may increase in future years without typical
    returns in the financial markets. We made contributions to our
    pension plans of $200 million in each of 2010 and 2009.
    Also, we contributed $200 million to our pension plans in
    January 2011. At the discretion of management, consistent with
    the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and depending upon financial
    market conditions, we anticipate making contributions to our
    pension plans of up to $1.2 billion over the next five
    years. We made postretirement benefit plan contributions of
    $160 million and $205 million in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. We are required by orders issued by the MPSC to
    make postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the
    amounts included in Detroit Edison’s and MichCon’s
    base rates. As a result, we contributed $81 million to our
    postretirement plans in January 2011 and expect to make up to an
    additional $90 million contribution to our postretirement
    plans in 2011 and, subject to MPSC funding requirements, up to
    $850 million over the next five years. The planned
    contributions will be made in cash, DTE Energy common stock or a
    combination of cash and stock.

See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Legal
    Reserves

We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and
    litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We
    regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection
    with asserted or potential matters, and establish reserves when
    appropriate. Legal reserves are based upon management’s
    assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and
    claims against us.



Insured
    and Uninsured Risks

Our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for
    various types of risks. Our insurance policies cover risk of
    loss including property damage, general liability, workers’
    compensation, auto liability, and directors’ and
    officers’ liability. Under our risk management policy, we
    self-insure portions of certain risks up to specified limits,
    depending on the type of exposure. The maximum self-insured
    retention for various risks is as follows: property damage-
    $10 million, general liability- $7 million,
    workers’ compensation- $9 million, and auto

liability-$7 million.

We have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but
    not reported (IBNR) liability prepared annually and we adjust
    our reserves for self-insured risks as appropriate. As of
    December 31, 2010, this IBNR liability was approximately
    $39 million.

Accounting
    for Tax Obligations

We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax
    effects of various financial transactions and results of
    operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing
    authorities. We account for uncertain income tax positions using
    a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a
    more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement
    attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of
    tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement. If the benefit does not meet the more
    likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical
    merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions
    that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax
    return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. We
    also have non-income tax obligations related to property, sales
    and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals related
    to these tax matters.

Accounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including
    assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be
    sustained, and estimating reserves for potential adverse
    outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. We also
    assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in
    the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already
    been reflected in the financial statements. We do not record
    valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital
    losses that we believe will be realized in future periods. We
    believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 are
    appropriately accounted. The ultimate outcome of such matters
    could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our
    consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be
    material.

See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

FAIR
    VALUE

Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as
    Derivative Assets or Liabilities. Contracts we typically
    classify as derivative instruments include power, gas, oil and
    certain coal forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign
    currency exchange contracts. Items we do not generally account
    for as derivatives include natural gas inventory, power
    transmission, pipeline transportation and certain storage
    assets. See Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

As a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting
    principles, the tables below do not include the expected
    earnings impact of non-derivative gas storage, transportation
    and power contracts. Consequently, gains and losses from these
    positions may not match with the related physical and financial
    hedging instruments in some reporting periods, resulting in
    volatility in DTE Energy’s reported

period-by-period

earnings; however, the financial impact of the timing
    differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery

and/or

settlement.

The Company manages its

mark-to-market

(MTM) risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period
    of its contracts and the individual components of the risks
    within each contract. Accordingly, it records and manages the
    energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in
    separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or
    gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or
    off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the
    risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period
    (e.g. by month and year).



The Company has established a fair value hierarchy, which
    prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
    fair value in three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives
    the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
    inputs (Level 3). For further discussion of the fair value
    hierarchy, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Price Risk

DTE Energy has commodity price risk in both utility and
    non-utility businesses arising from market price fluctuations.

The Electric and Gas utility businesses have risks in
    conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal, natural gas,
    uranium, electricity, and base metals to meet their service
    obligations. However, the Company does not bear significant
    exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the
    form of PSCR and GCR regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms. In
    addition, changes in the price of natural gas can impact the
    valuation of lost and stolen gas, storage sales revenue and
    uncollectible expenses at the Gas Utility. Gas Utility manages
    its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily
    through the sale of long-term storage contracts. The Company is
    exposed to short-term cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of
    the time differential between actual cash settlements and
    regulatory rate recovery.

Our Gas Storage and Pipelines business segment has limited
    exposure to natural gas price fluctuations and manages its
    exposure through the sale of long-term storage and
    transportation contracts.

Our Unconventional Gas Production business segment has exposure
    to natural gas and crude oil price fluctuations. These commodity
    price fluctuations can impact both current year earnings and
    reserve valuations. To manage this exposure we may use forward
    energy and futures contracts.



Our Power and Industrial Projects business segment is subject to
    electricity, natural gas, coal and coal-based product price risk
    and other risks associated with the weakened U.S. economy.
    To the extent that commodity price risk has not been mitigated
    through the use of long-term contracts, we manage this exposure
    using forward energy, capacity and futures contracts.

Our Energy Trading business segment has exposure to electricity,
    natural gas, crude oil, heating oil, and foreign currency
    exchange price fluctuations. These risks are managed by our
    energy marketing and trading operations through the use of
    forward energy, capacity, storage, options and futures
    contracts, within pre-determined risk parameters.

Credit
    Risk

Bankruptcies

The Company purchases and sells electricity, gas, coal, coke and
    other energy products from and to numerous companies operating
    in the steel, automotive, energy, retail, financial and other
    industries. Certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy
    protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
    Code. The Company regularly reviews contingent matters relating
    to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and
    records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable
    loss. The Company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for
    probable loss. The final resolution of these matters may have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Other

The Company has tracking mechanisms to mitigate a significant
    amount of losses related to uncollectible accounts receivable at
    Detroit Edison and MichCon. These mechanisms are subject to the
    jurisdiction of the MPSC and are periodically reviewed. See
    Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in Item 8 of this Report.

We engage in business with customers that are non-investment
    grade. We closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers
    and, when deemed necessary, we request collateral or guarantees
    from such customers to secure their obligations.

Trading
    Activities

We are exposed to credit risk through trading activities. Credit
    risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading
    counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations. We
    utilize both external and internal credit assessments when
    determining the credit quality of our trading counterparties.
    The following table displays the credit quality of our trading
    counterparties as of December 31, 2010:

Interest
    Rate Risk

We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the
    issuance of debt and preferred securities. In order to manage
    interest costs, we may use treasury locks and interest rate swap
    agreements. Our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily
    from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial paper rates
    and London Inter-Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). As of
    December 31, 2010, we had a floating rate

debt-to-total

debt ratio of approximately two percent (excluding securitized
    debt).

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

We have foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price
    fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts. These
    contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily
    for the purchase and sale of power as well as for long-term
    transportation capacity. To limit our exposure to foreign
    currency exchange fluctuations, we have entered into a series of
    exchange forward contracts through January 2013. Additionally,
    we may enter into fair value foreign currency exchange hedges to
    mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans.

Summary
    of Sensitivity Analysis

We performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our
    commodity contracts, long-term debt obligations and foreign
    currency exchange forward contracts. The commodity contracts and
    foreign currency exchange risk listed below principally relate
    to our energy marketing and trading activities. The sensitivity
    analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 by a hypothetical 10% and
    calculating the resulting change in the fair values.

    December 31, 2010 and 2009:

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of disclosure controls and procedures

Management of the Company carried out an evaluation, under the
    supervision and with the participation of DTE Energy’s
    Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
    of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
    Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e))

as of December 31, 2010, which is the end of the period
    covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the
    Company’s CEO and CFO have concluded that such disclosure
    controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
    Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
    Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
    forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including its CEO and CFO, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure. Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness
    of any disclosure controls and procedures, management cannot
    provide absolute assurance that the objectives of its disclosure
    controls and procedures will be attained.

(b)

Management’s
    report on internal control over financial
    reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company has assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on this
    assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31,
    2010, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm who also audited the Company’s
    financial statements, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.

(c)

Changes
    in internal control over financial reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of DTE Energy Company and its
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
    ended in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
    opinion, the financial statement schedule for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 listed in the accompanying index
    presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
    consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1 —

ORGANIZATION
    AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Corporate
    Structure

DTE Energy owns the following businesses:

•

Detroit Edison, an electric utility engaged in the generation,
    purchase, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately
    2.1 million customers in southeast Michigan;

•

MichCon, a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase, storage,
    transportation, gathering, distribution and sale of natural gas
    to approximately 1.2 million customers throughout Michigan
    and the sale of storage and transportation capacity; and

•

Other businesses are involved in 1) natural gas pipelines
    and storage; 2) unconventional gas and oil project
    development and production; 3) power and industrial
    projects and coal transportation and marketing; and
    4) energy marketing and trading operations.

Detroit Edison and MichCon are regulated by the MPSC. Certain
    activities of Detroit Edison and MichCon, as well as various
    other aspects of businesses under DTE Energy are regulated by
    the FERC. In addition, the Company is regulated by other federal
    and state regulatory agencies including the NRC, the EPA and the
    MDNRE.

References in this report to “Company” or
    “DTE” are to DTE Energy and its subsidiaries,
    collectively.

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared
    using accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. These accounting principles require
    management to use estimates and assumptions that impact reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
    may differ from the Company’s estimates.

Certain prior year balances were reclassified to match the
    current year’s financial statement presentation.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The Company consolidates all majority owned subsidiaries and
    investments in entities in which it has controlling influence.
    Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the
    equity method when the Company is able to influence the
    operating policies of the investee. Non-majority owned
    investments include investments in limited liability companies,
    partnerships or joint ventures. When the Company does not
    influence the operating policies of an investee, the cost method
    is used. These consolidated financial statements also reflect
    the Company’s proportionate interests in certain jointly
    owned utility plant. The Company eliminates all intercompany
    balances and transactions.

Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the
    provisions of ASU

2009-17,

Amendments to FASB Interpretation 46(R)

. ASU

2009-17

changed the methodology for determining the primary beneficiary
    of a VIE from a quantitative risk and rewards-based model to a
    qualitative determination. There is no grandfathering of
    previous consolidation conclusions. As a result, the Company
    re-evaluated all prior VIE and primary beneficiary
    determinations. The requirements of ASU

2009-17

were
    adopted on a prospective basis.

The Company evaluates whether an entity is a VIE whenever
    reconsideration events occur. The Company consolidates VIEs for
    which it is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is not the
    primary beneficiary and an ownership interest is held, the VIE
    is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. When
    assessing the determination of the primary beneficiary, the
    Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances,
    including: the power, through voting or similar rights, to
    direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact
    the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb
    the expected losses

and/or

the
    right to receive the expected

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial
    Statements —

(Continued)

returns of the VIE. The Company performs ongoing reassessments
    of all VIEs to determine if the primary beneficiary status has
    changed.

Legal entities within the Company’s Power and Industrial
    Projects segments enter into long-term contractual arrangements
    with customers to supply energy-related products or services.
    The entities are generally designed to pass-through the
    commodity risk associated with these contracts to the customers,
    with the Company retaining operational and customer default
    risk. These entities generally are VIEs. The Company
    re-evaluated prior VIE and primary beneficiary determinations
    and, as a result, in 2010 began consolidating five entities that
    were previously accounted for as equity investments. The primary
    reason for the change in the primary beneficiary conclusion was
    the determination that the Company’s responsibility for the
    management and operations of the VIEs afforded the Company the
    power to direct the significant activities of the VIEs. In
    addition, the Company has interests in certain VIEs that we
    share control of all significant activities for those entities
    with our partners, and therefore are accounted for under the
    equity method.

The Company has variable interests in VIEs through certain of
    its long-term purchase contracts. As of December 31, 2010,
    the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the
    Consolidated Statement of Financial Position that relate to its
    variable interests under long-term purchase contracts are
    predominately related to working capital accounts and generally
    represent the amounts owed by the Company for the deliveries
    associated with the current billing cycle under the contracts.
    The Company has not provided any form of financial support
    associated with these long-term contracts. There is no
    significant potential exposure to loss as a result of its
    variable interests through these long-term purchase contracts.

In 2001, Detroit Edison financed a regulatory asset related to
    Fermi 2 and certain other regulatory assets through the sale of
    rate reduction bonds by a wholly-owned special purpose entity,
    Securitization. Detroit Edison performs servicing activities
    including billing and collecting surcharge revenue for
    Securitization. Under ASU

2009-17,

this entity is now a VIE, and continues to be consolidated as
    the Company is the primary beneficiary.

DTE Energy has interests in various unconsolidated trusts that
    were formed for the purpose of issuing preferred securities and
    lending the gross proceeds to the Company. The assets of the
    trusts are debt securities of DTE Energy with terms similar to
    those of the related preferred securities. Payments the Company
    makes are used by the trusts to make cash distributions on the
    preferred securities it has issued. DTE Energy has reviewed
    these interests and has determined they are VIEs, but the
    Company is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have
    variable interests in the trusts and therefore, the trusts are
    not consolidated by the Company.

The maximum risk exposure for consolidated VIEs is reflected on
    the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial
    Position. For non-consolidated VIEs, the maximum risk exposure
    is generally limited to its investment and amounts which it has
    guaranteed.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Revenues

Revenues from the sale and delivery of electricity, and the
    sale, delivery and storage of natural gas are recognized as
    services are provided. Detroit Edison and MichCon record
    revenues for electric and gas provided but unbilled at the end
    of each month. Rates for Detroit Edison and MichCon include
    provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel and
    purchased power costs, cost of natural gas and certain other
    costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between actual
    costs and the amounts billed in current rates. Under or over
    recovered revenues related to these cost tracking mechanisms are
    recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and
    are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments to
    the billing factors. See Note 12 for further discussion of
    cost recovery mechanisms.

Detroit Edison has a CIM, which is an over/under recovery
    mechanism that measures non-fuel revenues lost or gained as a
    result of fluctuations in electric Customer Choice sales. If
    annual electric Customer Choice sales exceed the baseline amount
    from Detroit Edison’s most recent rate case,
    90 percent of its lost non-fuel revenues associated with
    sales above that level may be recovered from full service
    customers. If annual electric Customer Choice sales decrease
    below the baseline, the Company must refund 90 percent of
    its increase in non-fuel revenues associated with sales below
    that level to full service customers.

Detroit Edison and MichCon have RDMs that are designed to
    minimize the impact on revenues of changes in average customer
    usage of electricity and natural gas. The January 2010 MPSC
    order in Detroit Edison’s 2009 rate case provided for,
    among other items, the implementation of a pilot electric RDM
    effective February 1, 2010. The electric RDM enables
    Detroit Edison to recover or refund the change in revenue
    resulting from the difference between actual average sales per
    customer compared to the base level of average sales per
    customer established in the MPSC order. The June 2010 MPSC order
    in MichCon’s 2009 rate case provided for, among other
    items, the implementation of a pilot gas RDM effective
    July 1, 2010. The gas RDM enables MichCon to recover or
    refund the change in revenue resulting from the difference in
    weather-adjusted average sales per customer compared to the base
    average sales per customer established in the MPSC order. The
    RDMs for Detroit Edison and MichCon address changes in customer
    usage due to general economic conditions and conservation, but
    do not shield the utilities from the impacts of lost customers.
    In addition, the pilot electric RDM materially shields Detroit
    Edison from the impact of weather on customer usage. The pilot
    gas RDM does not shield MichCon from the impact of weather on
    customer usage. The electric and gas RDMs are subject to review
    by the MPSC after the initial one-year pilot programs.

Non-utility businesses recognize revenues as services are
    provided and products are delivered. Revenues and energy costs
    related to trading contracts are presented on a net basis in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Commodity derivatives
    used for trading purposes are accounted for using the

mark-to-market

method with unrealized gains and losses recorded in Operating
    Revenues.

Accounting
    for ISO Transactions

Detroit Edison participates in the energy market through MISO.
    MISO requires that we submit hourly day-ahead, real time and FTR
    bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region.
    Detroit Edison accounts for MISO transactions on a net hourly
    basis in each of the day-ahead, real-time and FTR markets and
    net transactions across all MISO energy market locations. In any
    single hour Detroit Edison records net purchases in Fuel,
    purchased power and gas and net sales in Operating revenues on
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Detroit Edison
    records net sale billing adjustments when invoices are received.
    Detroit Edison records expense accruals for future net purchases
    adjustments based on historical experience, and reconciles
    accruals to actual expenses when invoices are received from MISO.

Energy Trading participates in the energy markets through
    various independent system operators and regional transmission
    organizations. These markets require that we submit hourly
    day-ahead, real time bids and offers for



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial
    Statements —

(Continued)

energy at locations across each region. We submit bids in the
    annual and monthly auction revenue rights and FTR auctions to
    the regional transmission organizations. Energy Trading accounts
    for these transactions on a net hourly basis for the day-ahead,
    real-time and FTR markets. These transactions are related to our
    trading contracts which are presented on a net basis in
    Operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income is the change in Common shareholders’
    equity during a period from transactions and events from
    non-owner sources, including net income. As shown in the
    following table, amounts recorded to accumulated other
    comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2010
    include unrealized gains and losses from derivatives accounted
    for as cash flow hedges, unrealized gains and losses on
    available for sale securities, the Company’s interest in
    comprehensive income of equity investees, and changes in benefit
    obligations, consisting of deferred actuarial losses, prior
    service costs and transition amounts related to pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans, and foreign currency
    translation adjustments.

Cash
    Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks
    and temporary investments purchased with remaining maturities of
    three months or less. Restricted cash consists of funds held to
    satisfy requirements of certain debt, primarily Securitization
    bonds, and partnership operating agreements. Restricted cash
    designated for interest and principal payments within one year
    is classified as a current asset.

Receivables

Accounts receivable are primarily composed of trade receivables
    and unbilled revenue. Our accounts receivable are stated at net
    realizable value.

The allowance for doubtful accounts for Detroit Edison and
    MichCon is generally calculated using the aging approach that
    utilizes rates developed in reserve studies. We establish an
    allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses
    and management’s assessment of existing economic
    conditions, customer trends, and other factors. Customer
    accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount
    billed is not received by the due date, which is typically in
    21 days, however, factors such as assistance programs may
    delay aggressive action. We assess late payment fees on trade
    receivables based on past-due terms with customers. Customer
    accounts are written off when collection efforts have been
    exhausted, generally one year after service has been terminated.

The customer allowance for doubtful accounts for our other
    businesses is calculated based on specific review of probable
    future collections based on receivable balances in excess of
    90 days.

Unbilled revenues of $575 million and $618 million are
    included in customer accounts receivable at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial
    Statements —

(Continued)

Notes
    Receivable

Notes receivable, or financing receivables, are primarily
    comprised of capital lease receivables and loans and are
    included in Other current assets and Notes receivable on the
    Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Notes receivable are typically considered delinquent when
    payment is not received for periods ranging from 60 to
    120 days. The Company ceases accruing interest (nonaccrual
    status), considers a note receivable impaired, and establishes
    an allowance for credit loss when it is probable that all
    principal and interest amounts due will not be collected in
    accordance with the contractual terms of the note receivable.
    Cash payments received on nonaccrual status notes receivable,
    that do not bring the account contractually current, are first
    applied to contractually owed past due interest, with any
    remainder applied to principle. Accrual of interest is generally
    resumed when the note receivable becomes contractually current.

In determining the allowance for credit losses for notes
    receivable, we consider the historical payment experience and
    other factors that are expected to have a specific impact on the
    counterparty’s ability to pay. In addition, the Company
    monitors the credit ratings of the counterparties from which we
    have notes receivable.

Inventories

The Company generally values inventory at average cost.

Gas inventory of $43 million and $44 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, at MichCon is
    determined using the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method. At December 31, 2010, the
    replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the LIFO
    cost by $147 million. At December 31, 2009, the
    replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the LIFO
    cost by $218 million.

Property,
    Retirement and Maintenance, and Depreciation, Depletion and
    Amortization

Property is stated at cost and includes construction-related
    labor, materials, overheads and, for utility property, an
    allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). The cost
    of utility properties retired, less salvage value, is charged to
    accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and
    repairs are charged to expense when incurred, except for Fermi 2.

The Company bases depreciation provisions for utility property
    at Detroit Edison and MichCon on straight-line and

units-of-production

rates approved by the MPSC.

Non-utility property is depreciated over its estimated useful
    life using straight-line, declining-balance or

units-of-production

methods.

The Company credits depreciation, depletion and amortization
    expense when it establishes regulatory assets for plant-related
    costs such as depreciation or plant-related financing costs. The
    Company charges depreciation, depletion and amortization expense
    when it amortizes these regulatory assets. The Company credits
    interest expense to reflect the accretion income on certain
    regulatory assets.

Approximately $3 million and $13 million of expenses
    related to Fermi 2 refueling outages were accrued at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
    Amounts are accrued on a pro-rata basis over an

18-month

period that coincides with scheduled refueling outages at Fermi
    2. This accrual of outage costs matches the regulatory recovery
    of these costs in rates set by the MPSC.

See Note 7.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial
    Statements —

(Continued)

Unconventional
    Gas Production

The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting
    for investments in gas properties. Under this method of
    accounting, all property acquisition costs and costs of
    exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred,
    pending determination of whether the well contains proved
    reserves. If an exploratory well does not contain proved
    reserves, the costs of drilling the well are expensed. The costs
    of development wells are capitalized, whether productive or
    nonproductive. Geological and geophysical costs on exploratory
    prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining properties
    without economical quantities of proved reserves are expensed as
    incurred. An impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized
    costs of proved gas properties exceed the aggregate related
    undiscounted future net revenues. An impairment loss is recorded
    to the extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties, on
    a

property-by-property

basis, are considered not to be realizable. Depreciation,
    depletion and amortization of proved gas properties are
    determined using the

units-of-production

method.

Long-Lived
    Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an
    asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the
    asset exceeds the expected future cash flows generated by the
    asset, an impairment loss is recognized resulting in the asset
    being written down to its estimated fair value. Assets to be
    disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
    fair value, less costs to sell.

Intangible
    Assets

The Company has certain intangible assets relating to emission
    allowances, renewable energy credits and non-utility contracts.
    Emission allowances and renewable energy credits are charged to
    expense as the allowances and credits are consumed in the
    operation of the business. The Company’s intangible assets
    related to emission allowances were $9 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Company’s intangible
    assets related to renewable energy credits were $17 million
    at December 31, 2010. The Company had no renewable energy
    credits at December 31, 2009. The gross carrying amount and
    accumulated amortization of contract intangible assets at
    December 31, 2010 were $63 million and
    $22 million, respectively. The gross carrying amount and
    accumulated amortization of contract intangible assets at
    December 31, 2009 were $64 million and
    $19 million, respectively. The Company amortizes contract
    intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the expected
    period of benefit, ranging from 4 to 30 years. Intangible
    assets amortization expense was $4 million in 2010,
    $4 million in 2009 and $7 million in 2008.
    Amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to be
    $4 million annually for 2011 through 2015.

Excise
    and Sales Taxes

The Company records the billing of excise and sales taxes as a
    receivable with an offsetting payable to the applicable taxing
    authority, with no net impact on the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Deferred
    Debt Costs

The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred
    and amortized over the life of each debt issue. In accordance
    with MPSC regulations applicable to the Company’s electric
    and gas utilities, the unamortized discount, premium and expense
    related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized over
    the life of the replacement issue. Discount, premium and expense
    on early redemptions of debt associated with non-utility
    operations are charged to earnings.

Investments
    in Debt and Equity Securities

The Company generally classifies investments in debt and equity
    securities as either trading or

available-for-sale

and has recorded such investments at market value with
    unrealized gains or losses included in earnings



DTE
    Energy Company

    Statements —

(Continued)

or in other comprehensive income or loss, respectively. Changes
    in the fair value of Fermi 2 nuclear decommissioning investments
    are recorded as adjustments to regulatory assets or liabilities,
    due to a recovery mechanism from customers. The Company’s
    equity investments are reviewed for impairment each reporting
    period. If the assessment indicates that the impairment is other
    than temporary, a loss is recognized resulting in the equity
    investment being written down to its estimated fair value. See
    Note 4.

The Company offsets the fair value of derivative instruments
    with cash collateral received or paid for those derivative
    instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master
    netting agreement, which reduces both the Company’s total
    assets and total liabilities. As of December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, the total cash collateral posted, net of
    cash collateral received, was $77 million and
    $117 million, respectively. Derivative assets and
    derivative liabilities are shown net of collateral of
    $9 million and $33 million, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2010 and $34 million and
    $120 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.
    The Company recorded cash collateral received of $2 million
    and cash collateral paid of $35 million not related to
    unrealized derivative positions as of December 31, 2010.
    The Company recorded cash collateral received of $1 million
    and cash collateral paid of $32 million not related to
    unrealized derivative positions, as of December 31, 2009.
    These amounts are included in accounts receivable and accounts
    payable and are recorded net by counterparty.

Government
    Grants

Grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that
    the grant will be received and that any conditions associated
    with the grant will be met. When grants are received related to
    Property, Plant and Equipment, the Company reduces the basis of
    the assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position,
    resulting in lower depreciation expense over the life of the
    associated asset. Grants received related to expenses are
    reflected as a reduction of the associated expense in the period
    in which the expense is incurred.

as well as qualifying special purpose entities that are
    currently outside the scope of

ASC 810-10.

Accordingly, the Company reconsidered its previous

ASC 810-10

conclusions, including (1) whether an entity is a VIE,
    (2) whether the enterprise is the VIE’s primary
    beneficiary, and (3) what type of financial statement
    disclosures are required. ASU

is
    effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that
    begins after November 15, 2009. The Company adopted the
    standard as of January 1, 2010. The adoption of the
    standard resulted in the consolidation of certain entities
    within the Power and Industrial Projects segment where the
    investments in such entities were previously accounted for under
    the equity method. See Note 1.

Fair
    Value Measurements and Disclosures

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-06,

Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements

. ASU

2010-06

requires details of transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2
    fair value measurements and the gross presentation of activity
    within the Level 3 fair value measurement roll forward. The
    new disclosures are required of all entities that are required
    to provide disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair
    value measurements. The Company adopted ASU

2010-06

effective January 1, 2010, except for the gross
    presentation of the Level 3 fair value measurement roll
    forward which is effective for annual reporting periods
    beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim reporting
    periods within those years.

Determining
    Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions
    Are Participating Securities

The Company adopted the requirements of

ASC 260-10

(FASB Staff Position EITF

No. 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions are Participating Securities)

effective
    January 1, 2009 and applied the requirements
    retrospectively. This FSP addresses whether instruments granted
    in share-based payment transactions are participating securities
    prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the
    earnings allocation in computing earnings per share. The
    adoption of the FSP had the effect of reducing previously
    reported 2008 amounts for basic and diluted earnings per common
    share by $.03 and $.02, respectively.

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company adopted

ASC 810-10

(SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an Amendment of
    ARB No. 51)

effective as of January 1, 2009
    and applied the new presentation and disclosure requirements
    retrospectively. As a result, the formats and captions of
    certain 2008 financial statement amounts were revised, including
    reclassifying minority interest expense as net income
    attributable to noncontrolling interests, and separately
    reflecting activity of noncontrolling interests in the
    Consolidated Statements of Equity and of Comprehensive Income.

NOTE 4 —

FAIR
    VALUE

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date
    in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a
    market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs,
    which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use
    in pricing assets or liabilities. These inputs can be readily
    observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable
    inputs. The Company makes certain assumptions it believes that
    market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities,
    including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the
    inputs to valuation techniques. Credit risk of the Company and
    its counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets
    and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact
    of which was immaterial at December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009. The Company believes it uses valuation
    techniques that maximize the use of observable market-based
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial
    Statements —

(Continued)

A fair value hierarchy has been established, which prioritizes
    the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in
    three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
    priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the
    lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). In some
    cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in
    different levels of the fair value hierarchy. All assets and
    liabilities are required to be classified in their entirety
    based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
    fair value measurement in its entirety. Assessing the
    significance of a particular input may require judgment
    considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may
    affect the valuation of the asset or liability and its placement
    within the fair value hierarchy. The Company classifies fair
    value balances based on the fair value hierarchy defined as
    follows:

•

Level 1

— Consists of unadjusted quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting
    date.

•

Level 2

— Consists of inputs other than
    quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly
    observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable
    through corroboration with observable market data.

•

Level 3

— Consists of unobservable inputs
    for assets or liabilities whose fair value is estimated based on
    internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that
    are generally less readily observable and supported by little,
    if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable
    inputs are developed based on the best available information and
    subject to cost-benefit constraints.

Transfers in/out of Level 3 represent existing assets or

    level and for which the inputs to the model became unobservable
    or assets and liabilities that were previously classified as
    Level 3 for which the lowest significant input became
    observable during the period. Transfers in/out of Level 3
    are reflected as if they had occurred at the beginning of the
    period. No significant transfers between Level 1 and 2
    occurred in years ended December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009. Transfers from Level 2 to
    Level 3 representing $9 million of assets reflect
    inputs related to certain power transactions identified as
    unobservable due to lack of available broker quotes for the year
    ended December 31, 2010. Transfers from Level 3 to
    Level 2

representing $35 million of liabilities reflect inputs
    related to certain power transactions identified as observable
    due to available broker quotes for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. Transfers out of Level 3 of
    $202 million reflect increased reliance on broker quotes
    for certain gas transactions for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Cash
    Equivalents

Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three
    months or less when purchased. The cash equivalents shown in the
    fair value table are comprised of investments in money market
    funds. The fair values of the shares of these funds are based on
    observable market prices and, therefore, have been categorized
    as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Trusts and Other Investments

The nuclear decommissioning trusts and other investments hold
    debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through
    commingled funds and institutional mutual funds. Exchange-traded
    debt and equity securities held directly are valued using quoted
    market prices in actively traded markets. The commingled funds
    and institutional mutual funds which hold exchange-traded equity
    or debt securities are valued based on the underlying
    securities, using quoted prices in actively traded markets.
    Non-exchange-traded fixed income securities are valued based
    upon quotations available from brokers or pricing services. A
    primary price source is identified by asset type, class or issue
    for each security. The trustees monitor prices supplied by
    pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or
    change the primary price source of a given security if the
    trustees determine that another price source is considered to be
    preferable. DTE Energy has obtained an understanding of how
    these prices are derived, including the nature and observability
    of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, DTE
    Energy selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by
    comparison of market-based price sources.

Derivative
    Assets and Liabilities

Derivative assets and liabilities are comprised of physical and
    financial derivative contracts, including futures, forwards,
    options and swaps that are both exchange-traded and

over-the-counter

traded contracts. Various inputs are used to value derivatives
    depending on the type of contract and availability of market
    data. Exchange-traded derivative contracts are valued using
    quoted prices in active markets. DTE Energy considers the
    following criteria in determining whether a market is considered
    active: frequency in which pricing information is updated,
    variability in pricing between sources or over time and the
    availability of public information. Other derivative contracts
    are valued based upon a variety of inputs including commodity
    market prices, broker quotes, interest rates, credit ratings,
    default rates, market-based seasonality and basis differential
    factors. DTE Energy monitors the prices that are supplied by
    brokers and pricing services and may use a supplemental price
    source or change the primary price source of an index if prices
    become unavailable or another price source is determined to be
    more representative of fair value. DTE Energy has obtained an
    understanding of how these prices are derived. Additionally, DTE
    Energy selectively corroborates the fair value of its
    transactions by comparison of market-based price sources.
    Mathematical valuation models are used for derivatives for which
    external market data is not readily observable, such as
    contracts which extend beyond the actively traded reporting
    period.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using quoted
    market prices when available and a discounted cash flow analysis
    based upon estimated current borrowing rates when quoted market
    prices are not available. The table below shows the fair value
    and the carrying value for long-term debt securities. Certain
    other financial

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Trust Funds

Detroit Edison has a legal obligation to decommission its
    nuclear power plants following the expiration of their operating
    licenses. This obligation is reflected as an asset retirement
    obligation on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
    See Note 9 for additional information.

The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear
    power plants and requires decommissioning funding based upon a
    formula. The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of
    decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of
    external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi 2.
    Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of
    decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level
    radioactive waste. Detroit Edison is continuing to
    fund FERC jurisdictional amounts for decommissioning even
    though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates. The
    Company believes the MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate
    to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning using the NRC
    formula. The decommissioning assets, anticipated earnings
    thereon and future revenues from decommissioning collections
    will be used to decommission Fermi 2. The Company expects the
    liabilities to be reduced to zero at the conclusion of the
    decommissioning activities. If amounts remain in the trust funds
    for Fermi 2 following the completion of the decommissioning
    activities, those amounts will be disbursed based on rulings by
    the MPSC and FERC. The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by
    Detroit Edison. Contributions to the Fermi 1 trust are
    discretionary.

At December 31, 2010, investments in the nuclear

    publicly traded equity securities, 38% in fixed debt instruments
    and 1% in cash equivalents. At December 31, 2009,
    investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds consisted
    of approximately 51% in publicly traded equity securities, 48%
    in fixed debt instruments and 1% in cash equivalents. The debt
    securities at both December 31, 2010 and December 31,

Securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are
    classified as

available-for-sale.

As Detroit Edison does not have the ability to hold impaired
    investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for the
    anticipated recovery of market value, all unrealized losses are
    considered to be other than temporary impairments.

Impairment charges for unrealized losses incurred by the Fermi 2
    trust are recognized as a Regulatory asset. Detroit Edison
    recognized $26 million and $48 million of unrealized
    losses as Regulatory assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Since the decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by
    Detroit Edison rather than through a regulatory recovery
    mechanism, there is no corresponding regulatory asset treatment.
    Therefore, impairment charges for unrealized losses incurred by
    the Fermi 1 trust are recognized in earnings immediately. There
    were no impairment charges in 2010, 2009 and 2008 for Fermi 1.

FINANCIAL
    AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Company recognizes all derivatives at their fair value as
    Derivative Assets or Liabilities on the Consolidated Statements
    of Financial Position unless they qualify for certain scope
    exceptions, including the normal purchases and normal sales
    exception. Further, derivatives that qualify and are designated
    for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of a
    forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be
    received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability
    (cash flow hedge), or as hedges of the fair value of a
    recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm
    commitment (fair value hedge). For cash flow hedges, the portion
    of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting
    the change in the value of the underlying exposure is deferred
    in Accumulated other comprehensive income and later reclassified
    into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. For fair
    value hedges, changes in fair values for the derivative are
    recognized in earnings each period. Gains and losses from the
    ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings
    immediately. For derivatives that do not qualify or are not
    designated for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are
    recognized in earnings each period.

The Company’s primary market risk exposure is associated
    with commodity prices, credit, interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange. The Company has risk management policies to
    monitor and manage market risks. The Company uses derivative
    instruments to manage some of the exposure. The Company uses
    derivative instruments for trading purposes in its Energy
    Trading segment and the coal marketing activities of its Power
    and Industrial Projects segment. Contracts classified as
    derivative instruments include power, gas, oil and certain coal
    forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign currency
    exchange contracts. Items not classified as derivatives include
    natural gas inventory, unconventional gas reserves, power
    transmission, pipeline transportation and certain storage assets.

Electric Utility

— Detroit Edison generates,
    purchases, distributes and sells electricity. Detroit Edison
    uses forward energy and capacity contracts to manage changes in
    the price of electricity and fuel. Substantially all of these
    contracts meet the normal purchases and sales exemption and are
    therefore accounted for under the accrual method. Other
    derivative contracts are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism
    when settled. This results in the deferral of unrealized gains
    and losses as Regulatory assets or liabilities until realized.

Gas Utility

— MichCon purchases, stores,
    transports, gathers, distributes and sells natural gas and sells
    storage and transportation capacity. MichCon has fixed-priced
    contracts for portions of its expected gas supply requirements
    through March 2014. Substantially all of these contracts meet
    the normal purchases and sales exemption and are therefore
    accounted for under the accrual method. MichCon may also sell
    forward transportation and storage capacity contracts. Forward
    transportation and storage contracts are not derivatives and are
    therefore accounted for under the accrual method.

Gas Storage and Pipelines —

This segment is
    primarily engaged in services related to the transportation and
    storage of natural gas. Fixed-priced contracts are used in the
    marketing and management of transportation and storage services.
    Generally these contracts are not derivatives and are therefore
    accounted for under the accrual method.

Unconventional Gas Production

— The
    Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in
    unconventional natural gas and oil project development and
    production. The Company uses derivative contracts to manage
    changes in the price of natural gas and crude oil. In 2010 and
    prior periods, these derivatives were designated as cash flow
    hedges. Approximately $1 million after-tax gain recorded in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of 2009 was
    reclassified to earnings as the related production affected
    earnings through 2010. Total pre-tax gains from derivative
    contracts on natural gas during 2010 were approximately
    $3 million.

Power and Industrial Projects

— Business units
    within this segment manage and operate onsite energy and
    pulverized coal projects, coke batteries, landfill gas recovery
    and power generation assets. These businesses utilize
    fixed-priced contracts in the marketing and management of their
    assets. These contracts are generally not

derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual
    method. The segment also engages in coal marketing which
    includes the marketing and trading of physical coal and coal
    financial instruments, and forward contracts for the purchase
    and sale of emissions allowances. Certain of these physical and
    financial coal contracts and contracts for the purchase and sale
    of emission allowances are derivatives and are accounted for by
    recording changes in fair value to earnings.

Energy Trading — Commodity Price Risk —

Energy Trading markets and trades electricity and natural
    gas physical products and energy financial instruments, and
    provides risk management services utilizing energy commodity
    derivative instruments. Forwards, futures, options and swap
    agreements are used to manage exposure to the risk of market
    price and volume fluctuations in its operations. These
    derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value
    to earnings unless hedge accounting criteria are met.

Energy Trading — Foreign Currency Exchange
    Risk —

Energy Trading has foreign currency
    exchange forward contracts to economically hedge fixed Canadian
    dollar commitments existing under power purchase and sale
    contracts and gas transportation contracts. The Company enters
    into these contracts to mitigate price volatility with respect
    to fluctuations of the Canadian dollar relative to the
    U.S. dollar. These derivatives are accounted for by
    recording changes in fair value to earnings unless hedge
    accounting criteria are met.

Corporate and Other — Interest Rate
    Risk —

The Company uses interest rate swaps,
    treasury locks and other derivatives to hedge the risk
    associated with interest rate market volatility. In 2004 and
    2000, the Company entered into a series of interest rate
    derivatives to limit its sensitivity to market interest rate
    risk associated with the issuance of long-term debt. Such
    instruments were designated as cash flow hedges. The Company
    subsequently issued long-term debt and terminated these hedges
    at a cost that is included in other comprehensive loss. Amounts
    recorded in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to
    interest expense through 2033. In 2011, the Company estimates
    reclassifying less than $1 million of losses to earnings.

Credit Risk —

The utility and non-utility
    businesses are exposed to credit risk if customers or
    counterparties do not comply with their contractual obligations.
    The Company maintains credit policies that significantly
    minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an
    evaluation of potential customers’ and counterparties’
    financial condition, credit rating, collateral requirements or
    other credit enhancements such as letters of credit or
    guarantees. The Company generally uses standardized agreements
    that allow the netting of positive and negative transactions
    associated with a single counterparty. The Company maintains a
    provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the
    credit risk of its customers, historical trends, and other
    information. Based on the Company’s credit policies and its
    December 31, 2010 provision for credit losses, the
    Company’s exposure to counterparty nonperformance is not
    expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial statements.

Derivative
    Activities

The Company manages its MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon
    the delivery period of its contracts and the individual
    components of the risks within each contract. Accordingly, it
    records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations
    under its contracts in separate components based on the
    commodity (e.g. electricity or gas), the product (e.g.
    electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the
    delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g.
    forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and
    year). The following describe the four categories of activities
    represented by their operating characteristics and key risks:

•

Asset Optimization

— Represents derivative
    activity associated with assets owned and contracted by DTE
    Energy, including forward sales of gas production and trades
    associated with power transmission, gas transportation and
    storage capacity. Changes in the value of derivatives in this
    category economically offset changes in the value of underlying
    non-derivative positions, which do not qualify for fair value
    accounting. The difference in accounting treatment of
    derivatives in this category and the underlying non-derivative
    positions can result in significant earnings volatility.

•

Marketing and Origination

— Represents
    derivative activity transacted by originating substantially
    hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers, producers, end
    users, utilities, retail aggregators and alternative energy
    suppliers.

•

Fundamentals Based Trading

— Represents
    derivative activity transacted with the intent of taking a view,
    capturing market price changes, or putting capital at risk. This
    activity is speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an
    existing exposure.

•

Other

— Includes derivative activity at Detroit
    Edison related to FTRs and forward contracts related to
    emissions. Changes in the value of derivative contracts at
    Detroit Edison are recorded as Derivative Assets or Liabilities,
    with an offset to Regulatory Assets or Liabilities as the
    settlement value of these contracts will be included in the PSCR
    mechanism when realized.

Various non-utility subsidiaries of the Company have entered
    into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed
    by DTE Energy. These contracts contain provisions which allow
    the counterparties to request that the Company post cash or
    letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE
    Energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment
    grade. Certain of these provisions (known as “hard
    triggers”) state specific circumstances under which the
    Company can be asked to post collateral upon the occurrence of a
    credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as “soft
    triggers”) are not as specific. For contracts with soft
    triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral
    which may be requested by counterparties

and/or

which
    the Company may ultimately be required to post. The amount of
    such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on
    commodity prices (primarily gas, power and coal) and the
    provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions. As of
    December 31, 2010, the value of the transactions for which
    the Company would have been exposed to collateral requests had
    DTE Energy’s credit rating been below investment grade on
    such date under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions
    was approximately $234 million. In circumstances where an
    entity is downgraded below investment grade and collateral
    requests are made as a result, the requesting parties often
    agree to accept less than the full amount of their exposure to
    the downgraded entity.

ASSET
    RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

The Company has a legal retirement obligation for the
    decommissioning costs for its Fermi 1 and Fermi 2 nuclear
    plants. To a lesser extent, the Company has legal retirement
    obligations for gas production facilities, gas gathering
    facilities and various other operations. The Company has
    conditional retirement obligations for gas pipeline retirement
    costs and disposal of asbestos at certain of its power plants.
    To a lesser extent, the Company has conditional retirement
    obligations at certain service centers, compressor and gate
    stations, and disposal costs for PCB contained within
    transformers and circuit breakers. The Company recognizes such
    obligations as liabilities at fair market value when they are
    incurred, which generally is at the time the associated assets
    are placed in service. Fair value is measured using expected
    future cash outflows discounted at our credit-adjusted risk-free
    rate. In its regulated operations, the Company recognizes
    regulatory assets or liabilities for timing differences in
    expense recognition for legal asset retirement costs that are
    currently recovered in rates.

No liability has been recorded with respect to lead-based paint,
    as the quantities of lead-based paint in the Company’s
    facilities are unknown. In addition, there is no incremental
    cost to demolitions of lead-based paint facilities vs.
    non-lead-based paint facilities and no regulations currently
    exist requiring any type of special disposal of items containing
    lead-based paint.

The Ludington Hydroelectric Power Plant (a jointly owned plant)
    has an indeterminate life and no legal obligation currently
    exists to decommission the plant at some future date.
    Substations, manholes and certain other distribution assets
    within Detroit Edison have an indeterminate life. Therefore, no
    liability has been recorded for these assets.

Detroit Edison has a legal obligation to decommission its
    nuclear power plants following the expiration of their operating
    licenses. This obligation is reflected as an asset retirement
    obligation on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
    In 2010, Detroit Edison filed a rate case with the MPSC
    proposing a reduction to the nuclear

decommissioning surcharge under the assumption that it would
    request an extension of the Fermi 2 license for an additional
    20 years beyond the term of the existing license which
    expires in 2025. This proposed extension of the license,
    including the associated impact on spent nuclear fuel, resulted
    in a revision in estimated cash flows for the Fermi 2 asset
    retirement obligation of approximately $22 million. It is
    estimated that the cost of decommissioning Fermi 2 is
    $1.3 billion in 2010 dollars and $10 billion in 2045
    dollars, using a 6% inflation rate. In 2001, Detroit Edison
    began the decommissioning of Fermi 1, with the goal of removing
    the radioactive material and terminating the Fermi 1 license.
    The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is expected to be completed by
    2012. Approximately $1.3 billion of the asset retirement
    obligations represent nuclear decommissioning liabilities that
    are funded through a surcharge to electric customers over the
    life of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant.

The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear
    power plants and requires minimum decommissioning funding based
    upon a formula. The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs
    of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use
    of external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi
    2. Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of
    decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level
    radioactive waste. Detroit Edison is continuing to
    fund FERC jurisdictional amounts for decommissioning even
    though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates. The
    Company believes the MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate
    to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning. The
    decommissioning assets, anticipated earnings thereon and future
    revenues from decommissioning collections will be used to
    decommission Fermi 2. The Company expects the liabilities to be
    reduced to zero at the conclusion of the decommissioning
    activities. If amounts remain in the trust funds for Fermi 2
    following the completion of the decommissioning activities,
    those amounts will be disbursed based on rulings by the MPSC and
    FERC.

A portion of the funds recovered through the Fermi 2
    decommissioning surcharge and deposited in external trust
    accounts is designated for the removal of non-radioactive assets
    and the

clean-up

of
    the Fermi site. This removal and

clean-up

is
    not considered a legal liability. Therefore, it is not included
    in the asset retirement obligation, but is reflected as the
    nuclear decommissioning liability. The decommissioning of Fermi
    1 is funded by Detroit Edison. Contributions to the Fermi 1
    trust are discretionary. See Note 4 for additional
    discussion of Nuclear Decommissioning
    Trust Fund Assets.

DISPOSALS
    AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Sale
    of Rail Services Assets

In 2010, the Company sold certain non-strategic rail services
    assets for gross proceeds of approximately $23 million. The
    Company recognized a gain of approximately $5 million, net
    of a write-off of goodwill of approximately $4 million.

Sale
    of Gathering and Processing Assets

In 2009, the Company sold certain non-strategic gas gathering
    and processing assets in northern Michigan for gross proceeds of
    approximately $45 million, which approximated its carrying
    value, including goodwill of approximately $13 million.

Sale
    of Interest in Barnett Shale Properties

In 2008, the Company sold a portion of its Barnett shale
    properties for gross proceeds of approximately
    $260 million. The Company recognized a gain of
    $128 million ($80 million after-tax) on the sale
    during 2008.

Plan
    to Sell Interest in Certain Power and Industrial
    Projects

In 2007, the Company announced its plans to sell a 50% interest
    in a portfolio of select Power and Industrial Projects. As a
    result, the assets and liabilities of the Projects were
    classified as held for sale at that time and the

Company ceased recording depreciation and amortization expense
    related to these assets. In 2008, the Company’s work on
    this planned monetization was discontinued and the assets and
    liabilities of the Projects were no longer classified as held
    for sale. Depreciation and amortization resumed when the assets
    were reclassified as held and used. In 2008, the Company
    recorded a loss of $19 million related to the valuation
    adjustment for the cumulative depreciation and amortization not
    recorded during the held for sale period.

Synthetic
    Fuel Business

The Company discontinued the operations of its synthetic fuel
    production facilities throughout the United States as of
    December 31, 2007. The Company provided certain guarantees
    and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in
    its synfuel facilities. The guarantees cover potential
    commercial, environmental, oil price and tax-related obligations
    and will survive until 90 days after expiration of all
    applicable statutes of limitations. The Company estimates that
    its maximum potential liability under these guarantees at
    December 31, 2010 is $2.6 billion, although payment
    under these guarantees is not considered probable. The Company
    has reported the business activity of the synthetic fuel
    business as a discontinued operation. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the synthetic fuels business had net
    income of $22 million (including $2 million for
    noncontrolling interests), primarily from asset gains, net of
    income taxes.

OTHER
    IMPAIRMENTS AND RESTRUCTURING

Other
    Impairments — Barnett Shale

Our Unconventional Gas Production segment recorded pre-tax
    impairment losses of $10 million, $6 million and
    $8 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    impairments related primarily to the write-off of expired or
    expiring leasehold positions that the Company does not intend to
    drill.

Restructuring
    Costs

In 2005, the Company initiated a company-wide review of its
    operations called the Performance Excellence Process. The
    Company incurred CTA restructuring expense for employee
    severance, early retirement programs and other costs which
    include project management and consultant support. In September
    2006, the MPSC issued an order approving a settlement agreement
    that allowed Detroit Edison and MichCon, commencing in 2006, to
    defer the incremental CTA. Further, the order provided for
    Detroit Edison and MichCon to amortize the CTA deferrals over a
    ten-year period beginning with the year subsequent to the year
    the CTA was deferred. Detroit Edison deferred approximately
    $24 million of CTA in 2008 as a regulatory asset and
    capitalized $2 million. The recovery of these costs for
    Detroit Edison was provided for by the MPSC in the order
    approving the settlement in the show cause proceeding and in the
    December 23, 2008 MPSC rate order. Detroit Edison amortized
    prior year deferred CTA costs of $18 million in 2010,
    $18 million in 2009 and $16 million in 2008. The
    September 2006 order did not provide a regulatory recovery
    mechanism for MichCon, therefore MichCon expensed CTA incurred
    during the period 2006 through 2008. The Company incurred
    restructuring expense, net of amounts deferred and capitalized
    of $10 million in 2008. The June 2010 MPSC order provided
    for MichCon’s recovery of the regulatory unamortized
    balance of CTA. At June 30, 2010, MichCon deferred and
    recognized in income approximately $32 million
    ($20 million after-tax) of previously expensed CTA. The
    non-pension component of CTA of approximately $21 million
    is included in Regulatory assets. The pension component of CTA
    of approximately $11 million is included in Regulatory
    liabilities. MichCon amortized approximately $2 million of
    prior year deferred CTA costs in 2010. Amounts expensed are
    recorded in Operation and maintenance expense on the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deferred amounts are
    recorded in Regulatory assets and Regulatory liabilities on the
    Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. See Note 12.

NOTE 12 —

REGULATORY
    MATTERS

Regulation

Detroit Edison and MichCon are subject to the regulatory
    jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to
    rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of
    generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of
    service, accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit
    Edison is also regulated by the FERC with respect to financing
    authorization and wholesale electric activities. Regulation
    results in differences in the application of generally accepted
    accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated
    businesses.

Regulatory
    Assets and Liabilities

Detroit Edison and MichCon are required to record regulatory
    assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have
    been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses.
    Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment
    requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of
    providing regulated services and be charged to and collected
    from customers. Future regulatory changes or changes in the
    competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of
    this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities
    for some or all of our businesses and may require the write-off
    of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no
    longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management
    believes that currently available facts support the continued
    use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory
    assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the
    current rate environment.

The following are balances and a brief description of the
    regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31:

As noted below, regulatory assets for which costs have been
    incurred have been included (or are expected to be included, for
    costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate
    case) in Detroit Edison or MichCon’s rate base, thereby
    providing a return on invested costs. Certain regulatory assets
    do not result from cash expenditures and therefore do not
    represent investments included in rate base or have offsetting
    liabilities that reduce rate base.

ASSETS

•

Recoverable pension and postretirement costs

— In 2007, the Company adopted ASC 715
    (SFAS No. 158) which required, among other
    things, the recognition in other comprehensive income of the
    actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs that arise
    during the period but that are not immediately recognized as
    components of net periodic benefit costs. Detroit Edison and
    MichCon record the charge related to the additional liability as
    a regulatory asset since the traditional rate setting process
    allows for the recovery of pension and postretirement costs. The
    asset will reverse as the deferred items are recognized as
    benefit expenses in net
    income.

(1)

.

•

Asset retirement obligation

— This obligation
    is primarily for Fermi 2 decommissioning costs. The asset
    captures the timing differences between expense recognition and
    current recovery in rates and will reverse over the remaining
    life of the related
    plant.

(1)

•

Recoverable income taxes related to securitized regulatory
    assets

— Receivable for the recovery of income
    taxes to be paid on the non-bypassable securitization bond
    surcharge. A non-bypassable securitization tax surcharge
    recovers the income tax over a fourteen-year period ending 2015.

•

Deferred income taxes — Michigan Business Tax (MBT)

— In July 2007, the MBT was enacted by the State
    of Michigan. State deferred tax liabilities were established for
    the Company’s utilities, and offsetting regulatory assets
    were recorded as the impacts of the deferred tax liabilities
    will be reflected in rates as the related taxable temporary
    differences reverse and flow through current income tax
    expense.

DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial
    Statements —

(Continued)

•

Cost to achieve Performance Excellence Process (PEP)

— The MPSC authorized the deferral of costs to
    implement the PEP. These costs consist of employee severance,
    project management and consultant support. These costs are
    amortized over a ten-year period beginning with the year
    subsequent to the year the costs were deferred.

•

Choice incentive mechanism

— Detroit Edison
    receivable for non-fuel revenues lost as a result of
    fluctuations in electric Customer Choice sales.

•

Recoverable uncollectible expense

— Detroit
    Edison and MichCon receivable for the MPSC approved
    uncollectible expense tracking mechanism that tracks the
    difference in the fluctuation in uncollectible accounts and
    amounts recognized pursuant to the MPSC authorization.

•

Other recoverable income taxes

— Income taxes
    receivable from Detroit Edison’s customers representing the
    difference in property-related deferred income taxes and amounts
    previously reflected in Detroit Edison’s rates. This asset
    will reverse over the remaining life of the related
    plant.

(1)

•

Unamortized loss on reacquired debt

— The
    unamortized discount, premium and expense related to debt
    redeemed with a refinancing are deferred, amortized and
    recovered over the life of the replacement issue.

•

Accrued PSCR revenue

— Receivable for the
    temporary under-recovery of and a return on fuel and purchased
    power costs incurred by Detroit Edison which are recoverable
    through the PSCR mechanism.

•

Accrued GCR revenue

— Receivable for the
    temporary under-recovery of and a return on gas costs incurred
    by MichCon which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.

•

Deferred environmental costs

— The MPSC
    approved the deferral of investigation and remediation costs
    associated with Gas Utility’s former MGP sites.
    Amortization of deferred costs is over a ten-year period
    beginning in the year after costs were incurred, with recovery
    (net of any insurance proceeds) through base rate filings.

•

Enterprise Business Systems (EBS) costs

— The
    MPSC approved the deferral and amortization over 10 years
    beginning in January 2009 of EBS costs that would otherwise be
    expensed.

•

Recoverable restoration expense

— Receivable
    for the MPSC approved restoration expenses tracking mechanism
    that tracks the difference between actual restoration expense
    and the amount provided for in base rates, recognized pursuant
    to the MPSC authorization.

•

Electric Customer Choice implementation costs

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization, the
    recovery of and a return on costs incurred associated with the
    implementation of the electric Customer Choice program.

•

Securitized regulatory assets

— The net book
    balance of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant was written off in 1998 and
    an equivalent regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the
    Fermi 2 regulatory asset and certain other regulatory assets
    were securitized pursuant to PA 142 and an MPSC order. A
    non-bypassable securitization bond surcharge recovers the
    securitized regulatory asset over a fourteen-year period ending
    in 2015.

(1)

Regulatory assets not earning a return.

LIABILITIES

•

Asset removal costs

— The amount collected from
    customers for the funding of future asset removal activities.

•

Deferred income taxes — Michigan Business
    Tax —

In July 2007, the MBT was enacted by the
    State of Michigan. State deferred tax assets were established
    for the Company’s utilities, and offsetting regulatory
    liabilities were recorded as the impacts of the deferred tax
    assets will be reflected in rates.

•

Negative pension offset —

MichCon’s
    negative pension costs are not included as a reduction to its
    authorized rates; therefore, the Company is accruing a
    regulatory liability to eliminate the impact on earnings of the
    negative pension expense accrued. This regulatory liability will
    reverse to the extent MichCon’s pension expense is positive
    in future years.

•

Renewable energy —

Amounts collected in rates
    in excess of renewable energy expenditures.

•

Refundable income taxes

— Income taxes
    refundable to MichCon’s customers representing the
    difference in property-related deferred income taxes payable and
    amounts recognized pursuant to MPSC authorization.

•

Refundable self implemented rates —

Amounts
    refundable to customers for base rates implemented by Detroit
    Edison and MichCon in excess of amounts authorized in MPSC
    orders.

•

Refundable revenue decoupling —

Amounts
    refundable to Detroit Edison customers for the change in revenue
    resulting from the difference between actual average sales per
    customer compared to the base level of average sales per
    customer established by the MPSC. Amounts refundable to MichCon
    customers for the change in revenue resulting from the
    difference in weather-adjusted average sales per customer
    compared to the base level of average sales per customer
    established by the MPSC.

•

Refundable costs under PA 141 —

Detroit
    Edison’s 2007 CIM reconciliation and allocation resulted in
    the elimination of Regulatory Asset Recovery Surcharge (RARS)
    balances for commercial and industrial customers. RARS revenues
    received that exceed the regulatory asset balances are required
    to be refunded to the affected classes.

•

Refundable restoration expense —

Amounts
    refundable for the MPSC approved restoration expenses tracking
    mechanism that tracks the difference between actual restoration
    expense and the amount provided for in base rates, recognized
    pursuant to the MPSC authorization.

•

Accrued PSCR refund

— Liability for the
    temporary over-recovery of and a return on power supply costs
    and transmission costs incurred by Detroit Edison which are
    recoverable through the PSCR mechanism.

•

Accrued GCR refund —

Liability for the
    temporary over-recovery of and a return on gas costs incurred by
    MichCon which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.

•

Fermi 2 refueling outage

— Accrued liability
    for refueling outage at Fermi 2 pursuant to MPSC authorization.

•

Pension equalization mechanism —

Pension
    expense refundable to customers representing the difference
    created from volatility in the pension obligation and amounts
    recognized pursuant to MPSC authorization.

    Electric Rate Case Filing

Detroit Edison filed a rate case on October 29, 2010 based
    on a projected twelve-month period ending March 31, 2012.
    The filing with the MPSC requested a $443 million increase
    in base rates that is required to recover higher costs
    associated with environmental compliance, operation and
    maintenance of the Company’s electric distribution system
    and generation plants, inflation, the capital costs of plant
    additions, the reduction in territory sales, the impact from the
    expiration of certain wholesale for resale contracts and the
    increased migration of customers to the electric Customer Choice
    program. Detroit Edison also proposed certain adjustments which
    could reduce the net impact on the required increase in rates by
    approximately $190 million. These adjustments relate to
    electric Customer Choice migration, pension and other
    postretirement benefits expenses and the Nuclear Decommissioning
    surcharge.

    Electric Rate Case Filing

On January 11, 2010, the MPSC issued an order in Detroit
    Edison’s January 26, 2009 rate case filing. The MPSC
    approved an annual revenue increase of $217 million or a
    4.8% increase in Detroit Edison’s annual revenue
    requirement for 2010. Included in the approved increase in
    revenues was a return on equity of 11% on an expected 49% equity
    and 51% debt capital structure. In addition, the order provided
    for continued application of adjustment mechanisms for electric
    Customer Choice sales and expenses associated with restoration
    costs (storm and non-storm) and line clearance expenses and
    implementation of RDM and UETM mechanisms.

Since the final rate relief ordered was less than the
    Company’s self-implemented rate increase of
    $280 million effective on July 26, 2009, the MPSC
    ordered refunds for the period the self-implemented rates were
    in effect. On December 21, 2010, the MPSC issued an order
    authorizing this refund to be applied as credits to customer
    bills during the January 2011 billing period. Detroit Edison has
    a refund liability of approximately $27 million, including
    interest at December 31, 2010 representing the refund due
    customers.

    Detroit Edison Depreciation Filing

In 2007, the MPSC ordered Michigan utilities to file
    depreciation studies using the current method, an approach that
    considers the time value of money and an inflation adjusted
    method proposed by the Company that removes excess escalation.
    In compliance with the MPSC order, Detroit Edison filed its
    ordered depreciation studies in November 2009. The various
    required depreciation studies indicate composite depreciation
    rates from 3.05% to 3.54%. The Company has proposed no change to
    its current composite depreciation rate of 3.33%. An MPSC order
    is expected in the second quarter of 2011.

Renewable
    Energy Plan

In March 2009, Detroit Edison filed its Renewable Energy Plan
    with the MPSC as required under Michigan Public Act 295 of 2008.
    The Renewable Energy Plan application requests authority to
    recover approximately $35 million of additional revenue in
    2009. The proposed revenue increase is necessary in order to
    properly implement Detroit Edison’s

20-year

renewable energy plan, to deliver cleaner, renewable electric
    generation to its customers, to further diversify Detroit
    Edison’s and the State of Michigan’s sources of
    electric supply, and to address the state and national goals of
    increasing energy independence. An MPSC order was issued in June
    2009 approving the renewable energy plan and customer
    surcharges. The Renewable Energy Plan surcharges became
    effective in September 2009. In August 2010, Detroit Edison
    filed its reconciliation for the 2009 plan year indicating that
    the 2009 actual renewable plan revenues and costs approximated
    the related surcharge revenues and cost of the filed plan. An
    MPSC order is expected in the third quarter of 2011.

Energy
    Optimization (EO) Plans

In March 2009, Detroit Edison and MichCon filed EO Plans with
    the MPSC as required under Michigan Public Act 295 of 2008. The
    EO Plan applications are designed to help each customer class
    reduce their electric and gas usage by: (1) building
    customer awareness of energy efficiency options and
    (2) offering a diverse set of programs and participation
    options that result in energy savings for each customer class.
    In March 2010, Detroit Edison and MichCon filed amended EO Plans
    with the MPSC. Detroit Edison’s amended EO Plan application
    proposed the recovery of EO expenditures for the period

2010-2015

of
    $406 million and further requested approval of surcharges
    to recover these costs, including a financial incentive
    mechanism. MichCon’s amended EO Plan proposed the recovery
    of EO expenditures for the period

2010-2015

of
    $150 million and further requested approval of surcharges
    that are designed to recover these costs, including a financial
    incentive mechanism. The MPSC approved the amended EO Plans and
    the surcharge and tariff sheets reflecting the exclusion of the
    financial incentive mechanism. The disposition of the financial
    incentive mechanisms is expected to be addressed in the EO
    reconciliation cases. In April 2010, Detroit Edison and MichCon
    filed reconciliations for the 2009 plan years. The Detroit
    Edison

reconciliation included $3.2 million in overrecovery, net
    of $3 million in incentives. The MichCon reconciliation
    included an underrecovery of $0.2 million, net of
    incentives of $0.9 million. On February 8, 2011, the
    MPSC issued an order approving Detroit Edison’s and
    MichCon’s 2009 EO reconciliation filings, including
    financial incentives for both utilities.

Detroit
    Edison Restoration Expense Tracker Mechanism (RETM) and Line
    Clearance Tracker (LCT) Reconciliation

In March 2010, Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC
    for approval of the reconciliation of its 2009 RETM and LCT. The
    Company’s 2009 restoration and line clearance expenses are
    less than the amount provided in rates. Accordingly, Detroit
    Edison has proposed a refund in the amount of approximately
    $16 million, including interest. An MPSC order is expected
    in the second quarter of 2011.

Detroit
    Edison Uncollectible Expense

True-Up

Mechanism (UETM)

In March 2010, Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC
    for approval of its UETM for 2009 requesting recovery of
    approximately $4.5 million consisting of costs related to
    2009 uncollectible expense and associated carrying charges. In
    August 2010, the MPSC determined that the UETM was effective
    with its January 2010 order in Detroit Edison’s rate case
    and dismissed the request for UETM expenses for 2009.

Detroit
    Edison Regulatory Asset Recovery Surcharge (RARS)
    Reconciliation

In April 2010, Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC
    for approval of the final reconciliation of its RARS. On
    January 20, 2011, the MPSC issued an order authorizing a
    refund of approximately $28 million, including interest, to
    be applied as credits to customer bills during the February 2011
    billing period.

Power
    Supply Cost Recovery Proceedings

The PSCR process is designed to allow Detroit Edison to recover
    all of its power supply costs if incurred under reasonable and
    prudent policies and practices. Detroit Edison’s power
    supply costs include fuel costs, purchased and net interchange
    power costs, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission
    allowances costs, urea costs, transmission costs and MISO costs.
    The MPSC reviews these costs, policies and practices for
    prudence in annual plan and reconciliation filings.

The following table summarizes Detroit Edison’s PSCR
    reconciliation filing currently pending with the MPSC:

    included in base rates for all PSCR customers. The filing
    supports a 2010 power supply expense forecast of
    $1.2 billion. Also included in the filing is a request for
    approval of the Company’s expense associated with the use
    of urea in the selective catalytic reduction units at Monroe
    power plant as well as a request for approval of a contract for
    capacity and energy associated with a wind energy project. The
    Company has also requested authority to recover transfer prices
    for renewable energy, coke oven gas expense and other potential
    expenses.

2011 Plan Year

— In September 2010, Detroit
    Edison filed its 2011 PSCR plan case seeking approval of a
    levelized PSCR factor of 2.98 mills/kWh below the amount
    included in base rates for all PSCR customers. The filing
    supports a total power supply expense forecast of
    $1.2 billion. The plan also includes approximately
    $36 million for the recovery of its projected 2010 PSCR
    under-recovery.

    Gas Rate Case Filing

MichCon filed a rate case on July 27, 2010 based on a fully
    projected 2011 test year. The filing with the MPSC requested a
    $51 million increase in revenues. During the pendency of
    this proceeding, MichCon continuously evaluated its case and
    determined that it no longer desired to pursue the relief
    requested. On December 13, 2010, the MPSC approved
    MichCon’s request to withdraw this rate filing.

    Gas Rate Case Filing

On June 3, 2010, the MPSC issued an order in MichCon’s
    June 9, 2009 rate case filing. The MPSC approved an annual
    revenue increase of $119 million. Included in the approved
    increase in revenues was a return on equity of 11% on an
    expected permanent capital structure of 50.4% equity and 49.6%
    debt. The rate order includes a $22 million impact of lower
    depreciation rates as ordered by the MPSC in March 2010,
    effective April 1, 2010. Since the final rate relief
    ordered was less than the Company’s self-implemented rate
    increase of $170 million effective on January 1, 2010,
    the MPSC ordered refunds for the period the self-implemented
    rates were in effect. On January 20, 2011, the MPSC issued
    an order authorizing this refund to be applied as credits to
    customer bills during the February 2011 billing period. MichCon
    has a refund liability of approximately $26 million,
    including interest at December 31, 2010 representing the
    refund due customers.

Other key aspects of the MPSC order include the following:

•

Continued application of an Uncollectible Expense Tracking
    Mechanism with two modifications. The base amount was increased
    prospectively from $37 million to $70 million with an
    80/20 percent sharing of the expenses (modified from 90/10)
    above or below the base amount.

•

Implementation of a pilot Revenue Decoupling Mechanism, that
    will require MichCon to recover or refund the change in
    distribution revenue resulting from the difference in
    weather-adjusted average sales per customer by rate schedule
    compared to the base average sales per customer by rate schedule
    established in the MPSC order for the period July 1, 2010
    to June 30, 2011.

•

    MichCon Depreciation Filing

On March 18, 2010, the MPSC issued an order reducing
    MichCon’s composite depreciation rates from 2.97% to 2.38%
    effective April 1, 2010.

MichCon
    UETM

In March 2010, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for
    approval of its UETM for 2009 requesting approximately
    $59 million consisting of $51 million of costs related
    to 2009 uncollectible expense and associated carrying charges
    and $8 million of under-collections for the 2007 UETM. On
    December 21, 2010, the MPSC approved MichCon’s request
    with new surcharges applicable to services rendered beginning on
    January 1, 2011.

Gas
    Cost Recovery Proceedings

The GCR process is designed to allow MichCon to recover all of
    its gas supply costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent
    policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies
    and practices for prudence in annual plan and reconciliation
    filings.

The following table summarizes MichCon’s GCR reconciliation

    September 2010 authorizing MichCon to charge a maximum of $7.06
    per Mcf, adjustable monthly by a contingent factor. The MPSC
    also approved MichCon’s proposed fixed price gas purchasing
    program and provided clarification regarding treatment of
    certain affiliate purchases.

    $5.89 per Mcf adjustable monthly by a contingency factor.

Gas
    Main Renewal and Gas Meter Move Out Programs

The June 3, 2010 MPSC gas rate case order required MichCon
    to make filings related to gas main renewal and meter move-out
    programs. In a July 30, 2010 filing, MichCon proposed to
    implement a

10-year

gas
    main renewal program beginning in 2012 which would require
    capital expenditures of approximately $17 million per year
    for renewing gas distribution mains, retiring gas mains, and
    where appropriate and when related to the gas main renewal or
    retirement activity, relocate inside meters to outside locations
    and renew service lines.

In a September 30, 2010 filing, MichCon proposed to
    implement a

10-year

gas
    meter move out program beginning in 2012 which would require
    capital expenditures of approximately $22 million per year
    primarily for relocation of inside meters to the outside of
    residents’ houses. Recovery of costs associated with these
    two programs is expected to be provided through these filings or
    future MichCon rate cases.

Other

The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the unresolved
    regulatory matters discussed herein. Resolution of these matters
    is dependent upon future MPSC orders and appeals, which may
    materially impact the financial position, results of operations
    and cash flows of the Company.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    estimated future tax effect of temporary differences between the
    tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts in
    the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are classified as current or noncurrent according to the
    classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred
    tax assets and liabilities not related to assets or liabilities
    are classified according to the expected reversal date of the
    temporary differences. Consistent with rate making treatment,
    deferred taxes are offset in the table below for temporary
    differences which have related regulatory assets and liabilities.

(Continued)

Production tax credits earned in prior years but not utilized
    totaled $337 million and are carried forward indefinitely
    as alternative minimum tax credits. The majority of the
    production tax credits earned, including all of those from our
    synfuel projects, were generated from projects that had received
    a private letter ruling (PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service
    (IRS). These PLRs provide assurance as to the appropriateness of
    using these credits to offset taxable income, however, these tax
    credits are subject to IRS audit and adjustment.

The above table excludes deferred tax liabilities associated
    with unamortized investment tax credits that are shown
    separately on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
    Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over
    the average life of the related property.

The Company has state deferred tax assets related to net
    operating loss and credit carry-forwards of $32 million and
    $43 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The state net operating loss and credit
    carry-forwards expire from 2011 through 2030. The Company has
    recorded valuation allowances at December 31, 2010 and 2009
    of approximately $32 million and $43 million,
    respectively, with respect to these deferred tax assets. In
    assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company
    considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
    or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
    ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
    the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
    which those temporary differences become deductible.

The Company had $5 million and $7 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010 and at
    December 31, 2009, respectively, that, if recognized, would
    favorably impact its effective tax rate. During the next twelve
    months, it is reasonably possible that the Company will settle
    certain federal and state tax examinations and audits. As a
    result, the Company believes that it is possible that there will
    be a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of up to
    $13 million within the next twelve months.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties pertaining to
    income taxes in Interest expense and Other expenses,
    respectively, on its Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    Accrued interest pertaining to income taxes totaled
    $3 million and $6 million at December 31, 2010
    and December 31, 2009, respectively. The Company had no
    accrued penalties pertaining to income taxes. The Company
    recognized interest expense related to income taxes of
    $1 million, $(2) million and $2 million in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

In 2009, the Company settled a federal tax audit for the 2004
    through 2006 tax years, which resulted in the recognition of
    $9 million of unrecognized tax benefits. In 2010, the
    Company settled a federal tax audit for the 2007 and 2008 tax
    years, which resulted in the recognition of $53 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s federal income tax
    returns for 2009 and subsequent years remain subject to
    examination by the IRS. The Company’s Michigan Business Tax
    returns for the year 2008 and subsequent years remain subject to
    examination by the State of Michigan. The Company also files tax
    returns in numerous state and local jurisdictions with varying
    statutes of limitation.

Michigan
    Business Tax

In July 2007, the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) was enacted by the
    State of Michigan to replace the Michigan Single Business Tax
    (MSBT) effective January 1, 2008. The MBT is comprised of
    an apportioned modified gross receipts tax of 0.8 percent;
    and an apportioned business income tax of 4.95 percent. The
    MBT provides credits for Michigan business investment,
    compensation, and research and development. Legislation was also
    enacted, in 2007, by the State of Michigan creating a deduction
    for businesses that realize an increase in their deferred tax
    liability due to the enactment of the MBT. The MBT is accounted
    for as an income tax.

The MBT consolidated deferred tax liability balance is
    $366 million as of December 31, 2010 and
    $357 million as of December 31, 2009 and is reported
    net of the related federal tax benefit. The MBT deferred tax
    asset balance is $330 million as of December 31, 2010
    and $331 million as of December 31, 2009 and is
    reported net of the related federal deferred tax liability. The
    utilities’ regulatory asset balance is $383 million
    and the regulatory liability balance is $418 million as of
    December 31, 2010. The utilities’ regulatory asset
    balance is $407 million and the regulatory liability
    balance is $423 million as of December 31, 2009 and is
    further discussed in Note 12.

COMMON
    STOCK

Common
    Stock

In March 2010, the Company contributed $100 million of DTE
    Energy common stock to the DTE Energy Company Affiliates
    Employee Benefit Plans Master Trust. The common stock was
    contributed over four business days from March 26, 2010
    through March 31, 2010 and was valued using the closing
    market prices of DTE Energy common stock on each of those days
    in accordance with fair value measurement and accounting
    requirements.

Under the DTE Energy Company Long-Term Incentive Plan, the
    Company grants non-vested stock awards to key employees,
    primarily management. As a result of a stock award, a settlement
    of an award of performance shares, or by exercise of a
    participant’s stock option, the Company may deliver common
    stock from the Company’s authorized but unissued common
    stock

and/or

from outstanding common stock acquired by or on behalf of the
    Company in the name of the participant.

Dividends

Certain of the Company’s credit facilities contain a
    provision requiring the Company to maintain a total funded debt
    to capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, of no
    more than 0.65 to 1, which has the effect of limiting the amount
    of dividends the Company can pay in order to maintain compliance
    with this provision. See Note 18 for a definition of this
    ratio. The effect of this provision as of December 31, 2010
    was to restrict the payment of approximately $46 million of
    total retained earnings of approximately $3.4 billion.
    There are no other effective limitations with respect to the
    Company’s ability to pay dividends.

NOTE 15 —

EARNINGS
    PER SHARE

The Company reports both basic and diluted earnings per share.
    The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes the
    issuance of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding
    during the period from the exercise of stock options. Effective
    January 1, 2009, the adoption of new accounting
    requirements clarifying the definition of participating
    securities to be included in the earnings per share calculation

Trust Preferred-Linked

Securities

DTE Energy has interests in various unconsolidated trusts that
    were formed for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities
    and lending the gross proceeds to the Company. The sole assets
    of the trusts are debt securities of DTE Energy with terms
    similar to those of the related preferred securities. Payments
    the Company makes are used by the trusts to make cash
    distributions on the preferred securities it has issued.

The Company has the right to extend interest payment periods on
    the debt securities. Should the Company exercise this right, it
    cannot declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or
    acquire, any of its capital stock during the deferral period.

DTE Energy has issued certain guarantees with respect to
    payments on the preferred securities. These guarantees, when
    taken together with the Company’s obligations under the
    debt securities and related indenture, provide full and
    unconditional guarantees of the trusts’ obligations under
    the preferred securities.

Financing costs for these issuances were paid for and deferred
    by DTE Energy. These costs are being amortized using the
    straight-line method over the estimated lives of the related
    securities.

SHORT-TERM
    CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS

In August 2010, DTE Energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
    Detroit Edison and MichCon, entered into amended and restated
    two-year unsecured revolving credit agreements and new
    three-year unsecured revolving credit agreements with a
    syndicate of 23 banks that may be used for general corporate
    borrowings, but are intended to provide liquidity support for
    each of the companies’ commercial paper programs. No one
    bank provides more than 8.25% of the commitment in any facility.
    Borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing
    short-term interest rates. Additionally, DTE Energy has other
    facilities to support letter of credit issuance.

The above agreements require the Company to maintain a total
    funded debt to capitalization ratio of no more than 0.65 to 1.
    In the agreements, “total funded debt” means all
    indebtedness of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries,
    including capital lease obligations, hedge agreements and
    guarantees of third parties’ debt, but excluding contingent
    obligations, nonrecourse and junior subordinated debt and
    certain equity-linked securities and, except for calculations at
    the end of the second quarter, certain MichCon short-term debt.
    “Capitalization” means the sum of (a) total
    funded debt plus (b) “consolidated net worth,”
    which is equal to consolidated total stockholders’ equity
    of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (excluding
    pension effects under certain FASB statements), as determined in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. At December 31, 2010, the total
    funded debt to total capitalization ratios for DTE Energy,
    Detroit Edison and MichCon are 0.49 to 1, 0.52 to 1 and 0.46 to
    1, respectively, and are in compliance with this financial
    covenant. The availability under these combined facilities at

The Company has other outstanding letters of credit which are

In conjunction with maintaining certain exchange traded risk
    management positions, the Company may be required to post cash

    allow for up to $50 million of additional margin financing
    provided that the Company posts a letter of credit for the
    incremental amount. At December 31, 2010, a
    $10 million letter of credit was in place, raising capacity
    under this facility for up to $110 million. The
    $10 million letter of credit is included in the table

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

Electric
    Utility

Air

— Detroit Edison is subject to the EPA
    ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant
    emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Since 2005, the
    EPA and the State of Michigan have issued additional emission
    reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate,
    regional haze and mercury air pollution. The new rules will lead
    to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
    nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. To comply
    with these requirements, Detroit Edison has spent approximately
    $1.5 billion through 2010. The Company estimates Detroit
    Edison will make capital expenditures of over $230 million
    in 2011 and up to $2.1 billion of additional capital
    expenditures through 2020 based on current regulations. Further,
    additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years
    which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide,
    nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants. It is not possible
    to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this
    time.

In July 2009, DTE Energy received a Notice of Violation/Finding
    of Violation (NOV/FOV) from the EPA alleging, among other
    things, that five of Detroit Edison’s power plants violated
    New Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration requirements, and operating permit requirements
    under the Clean Air Act. In June 2010, the EPA issued a NOV/FOV
    making similar allegations related to a recent project and
    outage at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant.

On August 5, 2010, the United States Department of Justice,
    at the request of the EPA, brought a civil suit in the
    U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
    against DTE Energy and Detroit Edison, related to the June 2010
    NOV/FOV and the outage work performed at Unit 2 of the Monroe
    Power Plant, but not relating to the July 2009 NOV/FOV. Among
    other relief, the EPA is requesting the court to require Detroit
    Edison to install and operate the best available control
    technology at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant. Further, the EPA
    is requesting the court to issue a preliminary injunction to
    require Detroit Edison to (i) begin the process of
    obtaining the necessary permits

for the Monroe Unit 2 modification and (ii) offset the
    pollution from Monroe Unit 2 through emissions reductions from
    Detroit Edison’s fleet of coal-fired power plants until the
    new control equipment is operating. In January 2011, the
    EPA’s motion for preliminary injunction was denied and the
    liability phase of the civil suit has been scheduled for trial
    in May 2011.

DTE Energy and Detroit Edison believe that the plants identified
    by the EPA, including Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant, have
    complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations.
    Depending upon the outcome of discussions with the EPA regarding
    the NOV/FOV and the result of the civil action, Detroit Edison
    could also be required to install additional pollution control
    equipment at some or all of the power plants in question,
    implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment
    is not economical, engage in supplemental environmental
    programs,

and/or

pay
    fines. DTE Energy and Detroit Edison cannot predict the
    financial impact or outcome of this matter, or the timing of its
    resolution.

Water

— In response to an EPA regulation,
    Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing
    the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures
    at several of its facilities. Based on the results of completed
    studies and expected future studies, Detroit Edison may be
    required to install additional control technologies to reduce
    the impacts of the water intakes. Initially, it was estimated
    that Detroit Edison could incur up to approximately
    $55 million in additional capital expenditures over the
    four to six years subsequent to 2008 to comply with these
    requirements. However, a January 2007 circuit court decision
    remanded back to the EPA several provisions of the federal
    regulation that has resulted in a delay in compliance dates. The
    decision also raised the possibility that Detroit Edison may
    have to install cooling towers at some facilities at a cost
    substantially greater than was initially estimated for other
    mitigative technologies. In 2008, the Supreme Court agreed to
    review the remanded cost-benefit analysis provision of the rule
    and in April 2009 upheld the EPA’s use of this provision in
    determining best technology available for reducing environmental
    impacts. Concurrently, the EPA continues to develop a revised
    rule, a draft of which is expected to be published in the first
    quarter of 2011, with a final rule scheduled for mid-2012. The
    EPA has also issued an information collection request to begin a
    review of steam electric effluent guidelines. It is not possible
    at this time to quantify the impacts of these developing
    requirements.

Contaminated Sites

— Prior to the construction
    of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and
    other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving
    coal, coke or oil. The facilities, which produced gas, have been
    designated as manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites. Detroit Edison
    conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites,
    including three former MGP sites. The investigations have
    revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas
    manufacturing at each site. In addition to the MGP sites, the
    Company is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated
    sites, including the area surrounding an ash landfill,
    electrical distribution substations, and underground and
    aboveground storage tank locations. The findings of these
    investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate
    these sites is expected to be incurred over the next several
    years. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the
    Company had $9 million accrued for remediation. Any
    significant change in assumptions, such as remediation
    techniques, nature and extent of contamination and regulatory
    requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs
    for the sites and affect the Company’s financial position
    and cash flows.

Landfill

— Detroit Edison owns and operates a
    permitted engineered ash storage facility at the Monroe Power
    Plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant.
    Detroit Edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and
    identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and
    reconstruction.

The EPA has published proposed rules to regulate coal ash under
    the authority of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act
    (RCRA). The proposed rule published on June 21, 2010
    contains two primary regulatory options to regulate coal ash
    residue. The EPA is currently considering either designating
    coal ash as a “Hazardous Waste” as defined by RCRA or
    regulating coal ash as non-hazardous waste under RCRA. Agencies
    and legislatures have urged the EPA to regulate coal ash as a
    non-hazardous waste. If the EPA designates coal ash as a
    hazardous waste, the agency could apply some, or all, of the
    disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other
    existing hazardous wastes to disposal and reuse of coal ash.
    Some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated

could have a significant impact on our operations and financial
    position and the rates we charge our customers. It is not
    possible to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at
    this time.

Gas
    Utility

Contaminated Sites

— Gas Utility owns, or
    previously owned, 15 former MGP sites. Investigations have
    revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas
    manufacturing at each site. In addition to the MGP sites, the
    Company is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated
    sites. Cleanup activities associated with these sites will be
    conducted over the next several years.

The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery
    mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at
    former MGP sites. Accordingly, Gas Utility recognizes a
    liability and corresponding regulatory asset for estimated
    investigation and remediation costs at former MGP sites. As of
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the Company
    had $36 million, accrued for remediation.

Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation
    techniques, nature and extent of contamination and regulatory
    requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs
    for the sites and affect the Company’s financial position
    and cash flows. The Company anticipates the cost amortization
    methodology approved by the MPSC for MichCon, which allows
    MichCon to amortize the MGP costs over a ten-year period
    beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs
    were incurred, and the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism
    for Citizens Fuel Gas approved by the City of Adrian, will
    prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse
    impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Non-Utility

The Company’s non-utility affiliates are subject to a
    number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the
    protection of the environment from various pollutants.

The Michigan coke battery facility received and responded to
    information requests from the EPA that resulted in the issuance
    of a Notice of Violation in June of 2007 alleging potential
    maximum achievable control technologies and new source review
    violations. The EPA is in the process of reviewing the
    Company’s position of demonstrated compliance and has not
    initiated escalated enforcement. At this time, the Company
    cannot predict the impact of this issue. Furthermore, the
    Michigan coke battery facility is the subject of an
    investigation by the MDNRE concerning visible emissions readings
    that resulted from the Company self reporting to MDNRE
    questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired by
    the Company to perform the visible emissions readings. At this
    time, the Company cannot predict the impact of this
    investigation.

The Company is also in the process of settling historical air
    and water violations at its coke battery facility located in
    Pennsylvania. At this time, the Company cannot predict the
    impact of this settlement. The Company received two notices of
    violation from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
    Protection in 2010 alleging violations of the permit for the
    Pennsylvania coke battery facility in connection with coal pile
    storm water runoff. The Company has implemented best management
    practices to address this issue and is currently seeking a
    permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
    Protection to upgrade its wastewater treatment technology to a
    biological treatment facility. The Company expects to spend
    approximately $0.7 million on the existing waste water
    treatment system to comply with existing water discharge
    requirements. The Company may spend an additional
    $13 million over the next few years to meet future
    regulatory requirements and gain other operational improvements
    savings. The Company’s non-utility affiliates are
    substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements,
    other than as noted above.

In February 2008, DTE Energy was named as one of approximately
    24 defendant oil, power and coal companies in a lawsuit filed in
    a United States District Court. DTE Energy was served with
    process in March 2008. The plaintiffs, the Native Village of
    Kivalina and City of Kivalina, which are home to approximately
    400 people in Alaska, claim that the defendants’
    business activities have contributed to global warming and, as a
    result, higher temperatures are damaging the local economy and
    leaving the island more vulnerable to storm activity in the fall
    and winter. As a result, the plaintiffs are seeking damages of
    up to $400 million for relocation costs associated with
    moving the village to a safer location, as well as unspecified
    attorney’s fees and expenses. On October 15, 2009, the
    U.S. District Court granted defendants’ motions
    dismissing all of plaintiffs’ federal claims in the case on
    two independent grounds: (1) the court lacks subject matter
    jurisdiction to hear the claims because of the political
    question doctrine; and (2) plaintiffs lack standing to
    bring their claims. The court also dismissed plaintiffs’
    state law claims because the court lacked supplemental
    jurisdiction over them after it dismissed the federal claims;
    the dismissal of the state law claims was without prejudice. The
    plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the Ninth Circuit.

Nuclear
    Operations

Property
    Insurance

Detroit Edison maintains property insurance policies
    specifically for the Fermi 2 plant. These policies cover such
    items as replacement power and property damage. The Nuclear
    Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) is the primary supplier of the
    insurance policies.

Detroit Edison maintains a policy for extra expenses, including
    replacement power costs necessitated by Fermi 2’s
    unavailability due to an insured event. This policy has a
    12-week waiting period and provides an aggregate
    $490 million of coverage over a three-year period.

Detroit Edison has $500 million in primary coverage and
    $2.25 billion of excess coverage for stabilization,
    decontamination, debris removal, repair

and/or

replacement of property and decommissioning. The combined
    coverage limit for total property damage is $2.75 billion.

In 2007, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005
    (TRIA) was extended through December 31, 2014. A major
    change in the extension is the inclusion of “domestic”
    acts of terrorism in the definition of covered or
    “certified” acts. For multiple terrorism losses caused
    by acts of terrorism not covered under the TRIA occurring within
    one year after the first loss from terrorism, the NEIL policies
    would make available to all insured entities up to
    $3.2 billion, plus any amounts recovered from reinsurance,
    government indemnity, or other sources to cover losses.

Under the NEIL policies, Detroit Edison could be liable for
    maximum assessments of up to approximately $28 million per
    event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear
    plant in the United States should exceed the accumulated funds
    available to NEIL.

Public
    Liability Insurance

As of January 1, 2011, as required by federal law, Detroit
    Edison maintains $375 million of public liability insurance
    for a nuclear incident. For liabilities arising from a terrorist
    act outside the scope of TRIA, the policy is subject to one
    industry aggregate limit of $300 million. Further, under
    the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005, deferred premium
    charges up to $117.5 million could be levied against each
    licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $17.5 million
    per year per facility. Thus, deferred premium charges could be
    levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the
    event of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities.

Nuclear
    Fuel Disposal Costs

In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982,
    Detroit Edison has a contract with the U.S. Department of
    Energy (DOE) for the future storage and disposal of spent
    nuclear fuel from Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is obligated to pay
    the DOE a fee of 1 mill per kWh of Fermi 2 electricity generated
    and sold. The fee is accounted as a component of nuclear fuel
    expense. Delays have occurred in the DOE’s program for the
    acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent
    repository and the proposed fiscal year 2011 federal budget
    recommends termination of funding for completion of the
    government’s long-term storage facility. Detroit Edison is
    a party in the litigation against the DOE for both past and
    future costs associated with the DOE’s failure to accept
    spent nuclear fuel under the timetable set forth in the Federal
    Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Detroit Edison currently
    employs a spent nuclear fuel storage strategy utilizing a fuel
    pool. In 2011, the Company expects to begin loading spent
    nuclear fuel into an

on-site

dry
    cask storage facility which is expected to provide sufficient
    storage capability for the life of the plant as defined by the
    original operating license. Issues relating to long-term waste
    disposal policy and to the disposition of funds contributed by
    Detroit Edison ratepayers to the federal waste fund await future
    governmental action.

Guarantees

In certain limited circumstances, the Company enters into
    contractual guarantees. The Company may guarantee another
    entity’s obligation in the event it fails to perform. The
    Company may provide guarantees in certain indemnification
    agreements. Finally, the Company may provide indirect guarantees
    for the indebtedness of others.

In connection with the November 2010 sale of the steam heating
    business by Thermal Ventures II, L.P. an $11 million bank
    term loan was repaid and the guarantee by Detroit Edison was
    released. In addition, Detroit Edison made a new $6 million
    secured senior term loan to the new entity. The Company has
    reserved the entire amount of the term loan.

The Company’s remaining guarantees are not individually
    material with maximum potential payments totaling
    $10 million at December 31, 2010.

The Company is periodically required to obtain performance
    surety bonds in support of obligations to various governmental
    entities and other companies in connection with its operations.
    As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately
    $14 million of performance bonds outstanding. In the event
    that such bonds are called for nonperformance, the Company would
    be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond.
    The Company is released from the performance bonds as the
    contractual performance is completed and does not believe that a
    material amount of any currently outstanding performance bonds
    will be called.

Millennium
    Pipeline Project

The Company owns a 26 percent equity interest in the
    Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium). Millennium is
    accounted for under the equity method. On August 26, 2010,
    Millennium closed on a $725 million long-term financing
    that is non-recourse to the Company. The proceeds thereof, along
    with equity contributions from the project sponsors, repaid in
    full Millennium’s $800 million construction loan and
    settled certain forward-starting interest rate swaps related to
    the new long-term financing. The Company’s share of the
    equity contribution was $49 million. The project
    partners’ guarantee of the $800 million construction
    loan and forward-starting interest rate swaps was terminated
    upon closing of the long-term financing. The project sponsors
    have agreed to provide credit support to Millennium’s debt
    service reserve requirement. The Company’s share of the
    credit support is $9 million and is being satisfied with a
    letter of credit in favor of the Trustee of the long-term bond
    holders.

Labor
    Contracts

There are several bargaining units for the Company’s
    approximately 5,000 represented employees. In the 2010 third
    quarter, a new three-year agreement was ratified covering
    approximately 3,800 represented employees. The majority of the
    remaining represented employees are under contracts that expire
    in June 2011 and August 2012.

Purchase
    Commitments

As of December 31, 2010, the Company was party to numerous
    long-term purchase commitments relating to a variety of goods
    and services required for the Company’s business. These
    agreements primarily consist of fuel supply commitments and
    energy trading contracts. The Company estimates that these
    commitments will be approximately $6 billion from 2011
    through 2051 as detailed in the following table:

Bankruptcies

The Company purchases and sells electricity, gas, coal, coke and
    other energy products from and to numerous companies operating
    in the steel, automotive, energy, retail, financial and other
    industries. Certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy
    protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
    Code. The Company regularly reviews contingent matters relating
    to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and
    records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable
    loss. The Company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for
    probable loss. The final resolution of these matters may have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Other
    Contingencies

The Company is involved in certain other legal, regulatory,
    administrative and environmental proceedings before various
    courts, arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning
    claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These
    proceedings include certain contract disputes, additional
    environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from
    various regulators, and pending judicial matters. The Company
    cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. The
    Company regularly reviews legal matters and records provisions
    for claims that it can estimate and are considered probable of
    loss. The resolution of these pending proceedings is not
    expected to have a material effect on the Company’s

Pension
    Plan Benefits

The Company has qualified defined benefit retirement plans for
    eligible represented and non-represented employees. The plans
    are noncontributory and cover substantially all employees. The
    plans provide traditional retirement benefits based on the
    employees’ years of benefit service, average final
    compensation and age at retirement. In addition, certain
    represented and non-represented employees are covered under cash
    balance provisions that determine benefits on annual employer
    contributions and interest credits. The Company also maintains
    supplemental nonqualified, noncontributory, retirement benefit
    plans for selected management employees. These plans provide for
    benefits that supplement those provided by DTE Energy’s
    other retirement plans.

The Company’s policy is to fund pension costs by
    contributing amounts consistent with the Pension Protection Act
    of 2006 provisions and additional amounts when it deems
    appropriate. The Company contributed $200 million to its
    pension plans in 2010, including a contribution of DTE Energy
    stock of $100 million (consisting of approximately
    2.2 million shares valued at an average price of $44.97 per

    widely accepted capital market principle that asset classes with
    higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-term.
    Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates, asset
    class risks and asset class returns are evaluated and considered
    before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The
    long-term portfolio return is also established employing a
    consistent formal process, with due consideration of
    diversification, active investment management and rebalancing.
    Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness. The long-term
    portfolio return is also established employing a consistent
    formal process, with due consideration of diversification,
    active investment and rebalancing. As a result of this process,
    the Company is lowering its long-term rate of return assumptions
    for its pension plans to 8.50% for 2011. The Company believes
    this rate is a reasonable assumption for the long-term rate of
    return on its plan assets for 2011 given its investment strategy.

At December 31, 2010, the benefits related to the
    Company’s qualified and nonqualified pension plans expected
    to be paid in each of the next five years and in the aggregate
    for the five fiscal years thereafter are as follows:

The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a
    mix of equities, fixed income and other investments are used to
    maximize the long-term return on plan assets consistent with
    prudent levels of risk, with consideration given to the
    liquidity needs of the plan. The intent of this strategy is to
    minimize plan expenses over the long-term. Risk tolerance is
    established through consideration of future plan cash flows,
    plan funded status, and corporate financial considerations. The
    investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity,
    fixed income and other investments. Furthermore, equity
    investments are diversified across U.S. and

non-U.S. stocks,

growth and value investment styles, and large and small market
    capitalizations. Fixed income securities generally include
    corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries,
    mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Other
    assets such as private equity and hedge funds are used to
    enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio
    diversification. Derivatives may be utilized in a risk
    controlled manner, to potentially increase the portfolio beyond
    the market value of invested assets and reduce portfolio
    investment risk. Investment risk is measured and monitored

The pension trust holds debt and equity securities directly and
    indirectly through commingled funds and institutional mutual
    funds. Exchange-traded debt and equity securities held directly
    are valued using quoted market prices in actively traded
    markets. The commingled funds and institutional mutual funds
    which hold exchange-traded equity or debt securities are valued
    based on underlying securities, using quoted prices in actively
    traded markets. Non-exchange traded fixed income securities are
    valued by the trustee based upon quotations available from
    brokers or pricing services. A primary price source is
    identified by asset type, class or issue for each security. The
    trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use
    a supplemental price source or change the primary price source
    of a given security if the trustees challenge an assigned price
    and determine that another price source is considered to be
    preferable. DTE Energy has obtained an understanding of how
    these prices are derived, including the nature and observability
    of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, DTE
    Energy selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by
    comparison of market-based price sources.

The Company also sponsors defined contribution retirement
    savings plans. Participation in one of these plans is available
    to substantially all represented and non-represented employees.
    The Company matches employee contributions up to certain
    predefined limits based upon eligible compensation, the
    employee’s contribution rate and, in some cases, years of
    credited service. The cost of these plans was $34 million,
    $33 million, and $33 million in each of the years

Healthcare
    Legislation

In March 2010, the PPACA and the HCERA were enacted into law
    (collectively, the “Act”). The Act is a comprehensive
    health care reform bill. A provision of the PPACA repeals the
    current rule permitting deduction of the portion of the drug
    coverage expense that is offset by the Medicare Part D
    subsidy, effective for taxable years beginning after
    December 31, 2012.

DTE Energy’s retiree healthcare plan includes the provision
    of postretirement prescription drug coverage
    (“coverage”) which is included in the calculation of
    the recorded other postemployment benefit (OPEB) obligation.
    Because the Company’s coverage meets certain criteria, DTE
    Energy is eligible to receive the Medicare Part D subsidy.
    With the enactment of the Act, the subsidy will continue to not
    be subject to tax, but an equal amount of prescription drug
    coverage expenditures will not be deductible. Income tax
    accounting rules require the impact of a change in tax law be
    recognized in continuing operations in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations in the period that the tax law change
    is enacted.

For DTE Energy and its utilities this change in tax law required
    a remeasurement of the Deferred Tax Asset related to the OPEB
    obligation and the Deferred Tax Liability related to the OPEB
    Regulatory Asset. The net impact of the remeasurement is
    $23 million, $18 million and $4 million for DTE
    Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon, respectively. The Detroit
    Edison and MichCon amounts have been deferred as Regulatory
    Assets as the traditional rate setting process allows for the
    recovery of income tax costs. Income tax expense of
    $1 million was recognized related to corporate entities in
    2010.

In December 2003, the Medicare Act was signed into law which
    provides for a non-taxable federal subsidy to sponsors of
    retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is
    at least “actuarially equivalent” to the benefit
    established by law. The effects of the subsidy reduced net
    periodic postretirement benefit costs by $7 million in
    2010, $20 million in 2009, and $14 million in 2008. At
    December 31, 2010, the gross amount of federal subsidies
    expected to be received in each of the next two years is
    estimated to be $7 million in 2011 and $8 million in
    2012.

Grantor
    Trust

MichCon maintains a Grantor Trust to fund other postretirement
    benefit obligations that invests in life insurance contracts and
    income securities. Employees and retirees have no right, title
    or interest in the assets of the Grantor Trust, and MichCon can
    revoke the trust subject to providing the MPSC with prior
    notification. The Company accounts for its investment at fair
    value with unrealized gains and losses recorded to earnings.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

The Company’s stock incentive program permits the grant of
    incentive stock options, non-qualifying stock options, stock
    awards, performance shares and performance units to employees
    and members of its Board of Directors. Key provisions of the
    stock incentive program are:

•

Authorized limit is 9,000,000 shares of common stock;

•

Prohibits the grant of a stock option with an exercise price
    that is less than the fair market value of the Company’s
    stock on the date of the grant; and

•

Imposes the following award limits to a single participant in a
    single calendar year, (1) options for more than
    500,000 shares of common stock; (2) stock awards for
    more than 150,000 shares of common stock;
    (3) performance share awards for more than
    300,000 shares of common stock (based on the maximum payout
    under the award); or (4) more than 1,000,000 performance
    units, which have a face amount of $1.00 each.

The Company records compensation expense at fair value over the
    vesting period for all awards it grants. In addition, the
    Company is required to record compensation expense at fair value
    (as previous awards continue to vest) for the unvested portion
    of previously granted stock option awards that were outstanding
    as of January 1, 2006. As of December 31, 2008, all
    such awards have been fully expensed.

Stock-based compensation for the reporting periods is as follows:

    standards.

Stock
    Awards

Stock awards granted under the plan are restricted for varying
    periods, generally for three years. Participants have all rights
    of a shareholder with respect to a stock award, including the
    right to receive dividends and vote the shares. Prior to vesting
    in stock awards, the participant: (i) may not sell,
    transfer, pledge, exchange or otherwise dispose of shares;
    (ii) shall not retain custody of the share certificates;
    and (iii) will deliver to the Company a stock power with
    respect to each stock award.

The stock awards are recorded at cost that approximates fair
    value on the date of grant. The cost is amortized to
    compensation expense over the vesting period.

Performance
    Share Awards

Performance shares awarded under the plan are for a specified
    number of shares of common stock that entitle the holder to
    receive a cash payment, shares of common stock or a combination
    thereof. The final value of the award is determined by the
    achievement of certain performance objectives and market
    conditions. The awards vest at the end of a specified period,
    usually three years. The Company accounts for performance share
    awards by accruing compensation expense over the vesting period
    based on: (i) the number of shares expected to be paid
    which is based on the probable achievement of performance
    objectives; and (ii) the closing stock price market value.
    The settlement of the award is based on the closing price at the
    settlement date.

The Company recorded compensation expense as follows:

Sum of cash and stock settlements approximates the intrinsic
    value of the liability.

During the vesting period, the recipient of a performance share
    award has no shareholder rights. However, for performance shares
    granted before 2010, recipients will be paid an amount equal to
    the dividend equivalent on such shares. Performance shares
    granted in 2010 or later will not be entitled to dividend
    equivalent payments before the performance shares granted are
    earned and vested. Performance share awards are nontransferable
    and are subject to risk of forfeiture.
