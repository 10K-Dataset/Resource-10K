Items
1., 1A. & 2. Business, Company Risk Factors and Properties

General

In 1995, DTE Energy incorporated in the State of Michigan. Our utility operations consist
primarily of Detroit Edison and MichCon. We also have three non-utility segments that are engaged
in a variety of energy related businesses such as synfuels, energy services, natural gas
exploration and production, energy marketing and trading, coal transportation and gas storage and
transportation. In August 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA), effective February 8, 2006. As a result of the repeal of PUHCA, DTE
Energy no longer has to claim itself as an exempt holding company. A discussion of the Energy
Policy Act of 2005 is in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of this Form 10-K.

Detroit Edison is a Michigan corporation organized in 1903 and is a public utility subject to
regulation by the MPSC and the FERC. Detroit Edison is engaged in the generation, purchase,
distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 2.2 million customers in southeastern
Michigan.

MichCon is a Michigan corporation organized in 1898 and is a public utility subject to regulation
by the MPSC. MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage, transmission, distribution and sale of
natural gas to approximately 1.3 million customers throughout Michigan.

Corporate Structure

Through 2004, we operated our businesses through three strategic business units (Energy
Resources, Energy Distribution and Energy Gas). Each business unit had utility and non-utility
operations. The balance of our business consisted of Corporate & Other. See Note 16 for financial
information by segment for the last three years. Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, we
realigned our operations into the following business units to strengthen the Company’s focus on
customer relationships and growth within our non-utility businesses. Based on this structure, we
set strategic goals, allocate resources and evaluate performance.

Refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis for an in-depth analysis of each segment’s
financial results. A description of each business unit follows.

ELECTRIC UTILITY

Description

Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison, an electric utility subject to regulation
by the MPSC and FERC. Detroit Edison is engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution and sale
of electric energy to approximately 2.2 million customers in a 7,600 square mile area in
southeastern Michigan.

Our plants are regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies, including the MPSC,
the FERC, the NRC, the EPA and the MDEQ. Electricity is generated from our numerous fossil plants,
a hydroelectric pumped storage plant and a nuclear plant, and is purchased from electricity
generators, suppliers and wholesalers. The electricity we produce and purchase is sold to four
major classes of customers: residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale, principally
throughout Michigan.

Represents power that is not distributed by Detroit Edison.

Weather, economic factors, competition and electricity prices affect sales levels to
customers. Our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter
of the year, driven by air conditioning and other cooling-related demands.

Our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a
few customers would not have a material adverse effect on Detroit Edison.

Fuel Supply and Purchased Power

Our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power. We expect
an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to serve customers. Our
generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal. Coal is purchased from
various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms.
We expect to obtain the majority of our coal requirements through long-term contracts with the
balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot purchases. We have several long-term
and short-term contracts for a total purchase of approximately 26 million tons of low-sulfur
western coal to be delivered from 2006 to 2008. We also have contracts with several suppliers for
the purchase of approximately 7 million tons of Appalachian coal to be delivered from 2006 through
2008. These existing long-term coal contracts have fixed prices except for a single contract that
has provisions for price escalation as well as de-escalation. We have approximately 90% of our 2006
expected coal requirements under contract. Given the geographic diversity of supply, we believe we
can meet our expected generation requirements. We lease a fleet of rail cars and have long-term
transportation contracts with companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of
purchased coal to our generating facilities.

Detroit Edison participates in the energy market through the Midwest Independent System Operator, a
Regional Transmission Organization. We offer our generation in the market on a day-ahead and
real-time basis and bid for power in the market to serve our load. We are a net purchaser of power
which supplements our generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles. For
example, when high temperatures occur during the summer, we require additional electricity to meet
demand. This access to additional power is an efficient and economical way to meet our obligation
to customers without increasing capital expenditures to build additional base-load power plants.

Properties

Detroit Edison owns generating plants and facilities that are located in the State of Michigan.
Substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage. Generating plants owned

There are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between Detroit
Edison and electricity providers external to our service area. These interconnections are
generally owned and operated by ITC and connect to neighboring energy companies.

Regulation

Detroit Edison’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies, including
the MPSC, the FERC and the NRC. The MPSC issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain
costs, including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of service,
accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit Edison’s MPSC-approved rates charged to customers
have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of
return on our investments. The FERC regulates Detroit Edison with respect to financing
authorization and wholesale electric activities.



The NRC has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation, construction, licensing and decommissioning of Detroit Edison’s nuclear
plant operations. We are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to
safety, the environment and health.

Since 1996, there have been several important acts, orders, court rulings and legislative actions
in the State of Michigan that affect Detroit Edison’s operations. In 1996, the MPSC began an
initiative designed to give all of Michigan’s electric customer’s access to electricity supplied by
other generators and marketers. In 1998, the MPSC authorized the electric Customer Choice program
that allowed for a limited number of customers to purchase electricity from suppliers other than
their local utility. The local utility continues to transport the electric supply to the
customers’ facilities, thereby retaining distribution margins. The electric Customer Choice
program was phased in over a three-year period, with all customers having the option to choose
their electric supplier by January 2002.

In 2000, the Michigan Legislature enacted legislation that reduced electric rates by 5% and
reaffirmed January 2002 as the date for full implementation of the electric Customer Choice
program. This legislation also contained provisions freezing rates through 2003 and preventing
rate increases for small business customers through 2004 and for residential customers through
2005. The legislation and an MPSC order issued in 2001 established a methodology to enable Detroit
Edison to recover stranded costs related to its generation operations that may not otherwise be
recoverable due to electric Customer Choice related lost sales and margins. The legislation also
provides for the recovery of the costs associated with the implementation of the electric Customer
Choice program. The MPSC has determined that these costs will be treated as regulatory assets.
Additionally, the legislation provides for recovery of costs incurred as a result of changes in
taxes, laws and other governmental actions including the Clean Air Act.

In 2004, the MPSC issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases
totaling $374 million, and eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for
electric Customer Choice customers. The increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a
rate cap. The interim order affirmed the resumption of the PSCR mechanism for both capped and
uncapped customers, which reduced PSCR revenues. The MPSC also authorized the recovery of
approximately $385 million in regulatory assets, including stranded costs. As part of the final
order Detroit Edison was ordered to file an application to restructure its electric rates.

In February 2005, Detroit Edison filed a rate restructuring proposal with the MPSC to restructure
its electric rates and begin phasing out subsidies within the current pricing structure. In
December 2005, the MPSC issued an order that provided for initial steps to improve the current
competitive imbalance in Michigan’s electric Customer Choice program. The December 2005 order
establishes cost-based power supply rates for Detroit Edison’s full service customers. Electric
Customer Choice participants will pay cost-based distribution rates while Detroit Edison’s full
service commercial and industrial customers will pay cost-based distribution rates that reflect the
cost of the residential rate subsidy. Residential customers continue to pay a subsidized below cost
rate for distribution service. These revenue neutral revised rates were effective February 1, 2006.
Detroit Edison was also ordered to file a general rate case no later than July 1, 2007, based on
2006 actual results.

See Note 4.

Energy Assistance Programs

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain
critical to Detroit Edison’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and
collections expenses. Detroit Edison’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly
affected by the level of government funded assistance its qualifying customers receive. We work
continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding
allocated to our customers is representative of the number of low-income individuals in our service
territory.



Strategy and Competition

We strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation in southeast Michigan. We can
accomplish this goal by working with our customers, communities and regulatory agencies to be a
reliable low cost supplier of electricity. To control expenses, we optimize our fuel blends thereby
taking maximum advantage of low cost, environmentally friendly low-sulfur western coals. To ensure
generation reliability we continue to invest in our generating plants, which will improve both
plant availability and operating efficiencies. We also are making capital investments in areas
that have a positive impact on reliability and environmental compliance with the goal of high
customer satisfaction.

Our distribution operations focus on improving reliability, restoration time and the quality
of customer service. We seek to lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies.
Revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions, economic factors, regulatory
events and other risk factors as discussed in the “Risk Factors” section that follows.

Effective January 2002, the electric Customer Choice program expanded in Michigan so that all of
the Company’s electric customers can choose to purchase their electricity from alternative electric
suppliers of generation services. Detroit Edison lost 12% of retail sales in 2005, 18% in 2004 and
12% of such sales in 2003 as a result of customers choosing to
purchase power from alternative electric suppliers. Customers participating in the electric Customer Choice program consist primarily of
industrial and commercial customers whose MPSC-authorized full service rates exceed their cost of
service. Customers who elect to purchase their electricity from alternative electric suppliers by
participating in the electric Customer Choice program have an unfavorable effect on our financial
performance. The effect of lost sales due to the electric Customer Choice program has reduced our
need for purchased power and when market conditions are favorable we sell power into the wholesale
market, in order to lower costs to full service customers.

Detroit Edison acquires transmission services from ITC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DTE Energy
until February 2003. By FERC order, rates charged by ITC to Detroit Edison were frozen through
December 2004. Thereafter, rates became subject to normal FERC regulation. With the MPSC’s
November 2004 final rate order, transmission costs are recoverable through Detroit Edison’s PSCR
mechanism.

Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the on-site
generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and
commercial customers. We do not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of
customers in the near term.

GAS UTILITY

Description

Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens, natural gas utilities subject to
regulation by the MPSC. MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage, transmission, distribution
and sale of natural gas to approximately 1.3 million residential, commercial and industrial
customers in the State of Michigan. MichCon also has subsidiaries involved in the gathering and
transmission of natural gas in northern Michigan. MichCon operates one of the largest natural gas
distribution and transmission systems in the United States. Citizens distributes natural gas in
Adrian, Michigan.

Gas delivery service provided
primarily to large-volume commercial and industrial
customers. Additionally, the service is provided to
residential customers, and small-volume commercial and
industrial customers who have elected to participate in our
Customer Choice program. End user transportation customers
purchase natural gas directly from producers or brokers and
utilize our pipeline network to transport the gas to their
facilities or homes.

•

Intermediate Transportation —

Gas delivery service provided
to producers, brokers and other gas companies that own the
natural gas, but are not the ultimate consumers.
Intermediate transportation customers utilize our gathering
and high-pressure transmission system to transport the gas to
storage fields, processing plants, pipeline interconnections
or other locations.

•

Other —

Includes revenues from providing appliance
maintenance, facility development, gas storage and other
energy-related services.

Our gas sales, end user transportation and intermediate transportation volumes, revenues and net
income are impacted by weather. Given the seasonal nature of our business, revenues and net income
are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. By the end of the first
quarter, the heating season is largely over, and we typically realize substantially reduced
revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter.

Our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a
few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our Gas Utility segment.

Natural Gas Supply

Our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily send-out capacity of 2.8 Bcf, with
approximately 67% of the volume coming from underground storage for 2005. Peak-use requirements
are met through utilization of our storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, and
purchased storage services. Because of our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline
transportation and storage capacity, we are able to reliably meet our supply requirements. We believe natural gas supply and pipeline capacity
will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future.

We purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers,
and we maintain a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts. Supplier, producing
region, quantity, and available transportation diversify our natural gas supply base. We obtain our
natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic areas (Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent,
Canada and Michigan) under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms. Gas supply pricing is
generally tied to published price indices to approximate current market prices.



Properties

We own distribution, transmission and storage properties that are located in the State of Michigan.
Our distribution system includes approximately 18,000 miles of distribution mains, approximately
1,179,000 service lines and approximately 1,320,000 active meters. We own approximately 2,600 miles
of transmission lines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect our
storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas.

We own properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working
gas storage capacity of approximately 124 Bcf. These facilities are important in providing reliable
and cost-effective service to our customers. Most of the company’s distribution and transmission
property are located on property owned by others and used by the company through easements, permits
or licenses. Substantially all of our property is subject to the lien of a mortgage.

We are directly connected to interstate pipelines, providing access to most of the major natural
gas producing regions in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and Canadian regions. The company’s primary
long-term transportation contracts are as follows:

Availability (MMcf/d)

Contract expiration

Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company



Trunkline Gas Company



Viking Gas Transmission Company



TransCanada PipeLines Limited



Great Lakes Gas Transmission L.P



ANR Pipeline Company



Vector Pipeline L.P



We own 840 miles of transportation and gathering pipelines in the northern lower peninsula of
Michigan. We lease a portion of our pipeline system to the Vector Pipeline Partnership (an
affiliate) through a capital lease arrangement. See Note 11. We also own a 2,400 horsepower
compressor station located in northern Michigan.

Regulation

We are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to rates,
recovery of certain costs, including the costs of regulatory assets, conditions of service,
accounting and other operating-related matters. We are subject to the requirements of other
regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment and health.

In the late 1990s, the MPSC began an initiative designed to give all of Michigan’s natural gas
customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower gas costs resulting from
competition. In 1999, the MPSC approved a comprehensive experimental three-year gas Customer Choice program that allowed
an increasing number of customers to purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their local
utility. In December 2001, the MPSC issued an order that continued the gas Customer Choice program
on a permanent and expanding basis. The permanent gas Customer Choice program was phased in over a
three-year period, with all customers having the option to choose their gas supplier by April 2004.
Since MichCon continues to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at
prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales, customers switching to other suppliers have
little impact on MichCon’s earnings.

In April 2005, the MPSC issued a final rate order which increased MichCon’s base rates by $61
million annually effective April 29, 2005. See Note 4.



Energy Assistance Program

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain
critical to MichCon’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections
expenses. MichCon’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of
government funded assistance its qualifying customers receive. We work continuously with the State
of Michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is
representative of the number of low-income individuals in our service territory.

Strategy and Competition

Our strategy is to expand our role as the preferred provider of natural gas in Michigan. As a
result of more efficient furnaces and appliances, and customer conservation due to high natural gas
prices, we expect future sales volumes to remain at current levels or slightly decline. We continue to provide energy-related services that capitalize on our expertise, capabilities and
efficient systems. We anticipate revenue growth through increased rates authorized by the MPSC in
April 2005. See Note 4. We continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by improving operating
efficiencies.

Competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas providers, as well as
providers of alternative fuels and energy sources. The primary focus of competition in the end user
transportation market is cost and reliability. Some large commercial and industrial customers have
the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal, electricity, oil and steam. If
these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source, they would not have a need for our
end-user transportation service. In addition, some of these customers could bypass our pipeline
system and have their gas delivered directly from an interstate pipeline. We compete against
alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service, supported by our
extensive storage capacity.

Our extensive transmission pipeline system has enabled us to develop a 600 to 700 Bcf annual market
for intermediate transportation services for Michigan gas producers, marketers, distribution
companies and other pipeline companies. We operate in a central geographic location with
connections to major Mid-western interstate pipelines that extend throughout the Midwest, eastern
United States and eastern Canadian markets.

NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS

Power and Industrial Projects

Description

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised of Coal-Based Fuels, On-Site Energy Projects,
Non-Utility Power Generation, Landfill Gas Recovery, and Waste Coal Recovery.

Coal-Based Fuels

Coal-based fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from our nine synfuel plants and
producing coke from two coke battery plants. The production of synfuel from all of the synfuel
plants and the production of coke from one of the coke battery plants generate production tax
credits. Production tax credits are designed to stimulate investment in and development of
alternate fuel sources. We have private letter rulings from the IRS for all of our synfuel plants.
Production tax credits for synfuel-related facilities and one coke battery expire in 2007.
Production tax credits were reinstated for one coke battery for the years 2006 through 2009.

The synthetic fuel process involves chemically modifying and binding particles of coal to produce a
fuel that is used for power generation and coke production. Since 2002, we have sold interests in
all nine of our synfuel plants, ranging from a 49%-99% share in each, or approximately 91% of our
total production



capacity. We will continue evaluating opportunities to sell additional interests
in our synfuel plants. We consolidate these projects due to our controlling influence and
continuing involvement.

The coke battery facilities produce coke that is used in blast furnaces within the steel industry.

On-Site Energy Projects

We own and/or operate on-site facilities, including pulverized coal injection, power generation,
steam production, chilled water, wastewater treatment, pulverized petroleum coke and compressed
air. Many of these facilities deliver utility-type services to industrial, commercial and
institutional customers. In 2005, we executed an agreement to purchase five on-site energy
projects. The purchase of three of the projects closed in 2005. We expect the purchases of the two
remaining projects will close early in 2006. We also began commercial operations of a petroleum
coke pulverizing facility located in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

Non-Utility Power Generation

We operate peaking, gas-fired and biomass-fired electric generating plants. We have four natural
gas-fired electric generating plants that are located in the Great Lakes region, and in 2005 we
acquired a 99% interest in one biomass-fired electric generating plant in California.

Landfill Gas Recovery

We develop, own and operate landfill gas recovery systems in the U.S. Landfill gas, a byproduct of
solid waste decomposition, is composed of approximately equal portions of methane and carbon
dioxide. We develop landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and use it productively.
Landfill gas recovery systems provide local utilities, industry and consumers with an opportunity
to use a competitive, renewable source of energy. During 2005, we acquired and placed in commercial
operation a coal mine gas processing facility in southern Illinois. This processed methane is sold
into the natural gas transmission system. Converting the methane into a renewable energy resource
conserves fossil fuels. Many of our facilities generate production tax credits that will expire in
2007.

Landfill gas recovery has operations in 13 states.

Waste Coal Recovery

We own the rights to a proprietary technology that produces high quality coal products from fine
coal slurries that are typically discarded from coal mining operations. The technology produces a
fine-coal fuel by removing impurities from waste coal material. The fine-coal fuel can be used in
power plants, as



a feedstock for synthetic fuel production and for other industrial applications.
Our first facility in Ohio became operational in late-2003. Certain problems were encountered in
the excavation of the waste material and delivery to the cleaning plant. We are in a testing phase
of a proprietary slurry mining system designed to allow us to economically produce a consistent
product at a rate of 300,000 tons of fine coal per year.

In late 2005, we completed construction of an “in-line” demonstration waste coal recovery facility
at an active coal preparation plant in Virginia. This facility is designed to increase the recovery
of high value coal while reducing the amount of discarded waste coal. We are currently conducting
preliminary testing. If the demonstration project proves successful, this may lead to additional
opportunities for similar projects in 2006.

Strategy and Competition

Power and Industrial Projects will continue leveraging its extensive energy-related operating
experience and project management capability to develop and grow our on-site energy business. We
will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell interests in our two remaining majority-owned
synfuel plants in 2006. We also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management
and operations services to third parties.

We anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate. In determining
the markets in which to compete, we examine closely the regulatory and competitive environment, the
number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins. We plan to maximize the
effectiveness of our inter-related businesses as we expand from our current regional focus. As we
pursue growth opportunities, our first priority will be to achieve value-added returns.

We intend to focus on the following areas for growth:

Landfill gas recovery’s strategy capitalizes upon our industry experience of over 15 years. We are
evaluating business growth through both development and acquisitions. We compete primarily with
fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal. However, we believe the environmental benefits of
landfill gas recovery along with reasonable and economic access to landfill sites provide a
platform for future growth.

We believe that the waste coal recovery business has the potential to contribute to future earnings
and provide significant environmental benefits.

Unconventional Gas Production

Description

Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural gas exploration, development and
production primarily within the Antrim shale in the northern lower peninsula of Michigan and the
Barnett shale in north central Texas. We are experienced in Antrim shale where we manage one of the
industry’s largest inventories of proved gas shale reserves. We are developing a significant
presence in the emerging Barnett shale.

During 2005, we invested $144 million acquiring, testing, developing and producing our Antrim and
Barnett shale acreage. In 2005, we added proved reserves of 76 Bcfe in both the Antrim and Barnett
shales, resulting in year end total proved reserves of 397 Bcfe. The Barnett shale wells yielded
0.7 Bcfe of production in 2005. Barnett shale leasehold acres increased to 87,804 gross acres
(75,994 net of interest



of others) primarily through the acquisition of a 100% interest in 44 wells
and 18,000 acres in one transaction. We drilled 17 development wells (11.2 net of interest of
others) in the Barnett shale acreage with a success rate of 100% in 2005. We also drilled 3 test
wells (100% gross and net of interest of others) in an unproved area of the southern portion of our
Barnett shale acreage holdings. Testing of the southern acreage is ongoing and will continue in
2006.

Strategy and Competition

We manage and operate our Antrim and Barnett shale gas properties to maximize returns on investment
and increase earnings with the overriding goal of optimizing the cost of producing reserves and
adding additional proved reserves. Some of our long-term contracts that fixed the prices of gas
sold from production of Antrim shale gas begin to expire in 2006. This will create opportunities
to remarket Antrim shale gas production at current higher market rates.

High natural gas prices and the potential for successes within the Barnett shale are resulting in
more capital being invested into the region. This competition for opportunities, goods and
services increases costs. However, our experience in the Antrim shale and our experienced Barnett
shale personnel provide an advantage in addressing potential cost increases.

In 2006, we expect to drill 130 wells in the Antrim shale and 55 wells in the Barnett shale.
Combined investment for both areas is expected to be approximately $100 million to $130 million
during 2006. Successful testing on unproved acreage may yield additional significant investment
opportunities.

Fuel Transportation and Marketing

Description

Fuel Transportation and Marketing consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading operations
of DTE Energy Trading, Coal Transportation and Marketing, and the Pipelines, Processing and Storage
businesses.



DTE Energy Trading

DTE Energy Trading focuses on physical power and gas marketing and trading, structured
transactions, enhancement of returns from DTE Energy’s power plants and the optimization
of contracted natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions. Our customer base is
predominantly utilities, local distribution companies, large industrials, and other marketing and
trading companies. We enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and
hedging activities. Most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted
for under the mark-to-market method, which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and
losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives. We utilize forwards, futures,
swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as
well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines. DTE Energy Trading is integral in
providing commodity risk management services to the other unregulated businesses within DTE Energy.

Coal Transportation and Marketing

Coal Transportation and Marketing provides fuel, transportation, and equipment management services
tailored to the individual requirements of each customer. We specialize in minimizing fuel costs
and maximizing reliability of supply for energy-intensive customers. Our external customers
include electric utilities, merchant power producers, integrated steel mills and large industrial
companies with significant energy requirements. Additionally, we participate in coal trading,
coal-to-power tolling transactions and the purchase and sale of emissions credits. Coal-to-power
tolling is another facet of the trading function, where we buy and arrange transportation of coal
to a power plant that has excess generating capacity. The plant then burns the coal and produces
electricity for a fee and returns it via the grid to DTE Energy Trading, which uses the power to
fulfill contracts or meet market needs.

Includes intercompany transactions of 20 tons, 18 tons and 14 tons in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

We also provide rail car equipment management services tailored to the individual requirements
of each customer. We operate a number of railcar maintenance and repair facilities in Nebraska and
Indiana serving coal transporters, as well as other industries and rail car types.

Pipelines, Processing and Storage

The Pipelines, Processing and Storage business owns and manages a network of natural gas
transmission pipelines, storage facilities and gas processing facilities. We have a partnership
interest in Vector Pipeline (Vector), an interstate transmission pipeline, which connects Michigan
to Chicago and Ontario market centers. We specialize in providing natural gas storage and
transportation services in the Midwest and Northeast markets.

Pipelines, Processing and Storage has interests in seven processing plants that extract carbon
dioxide from Antrim gas production in northern Michigan, making it suitable for transportation to
nearby markets. Additionally, we have storage capacity rights capable of storing up to 75.7 Bcf in
natural gas storage fields located in Michigan. The Washington 10 storage facility is a 66 Bcf
high deliverability storage field having bi-directional interconnections with Vector Pipeline and
MichCon providing customers access to the Chicago, Michigan and Ontario market hubs.

Strategy and Competition

DTE Energy Trading focuses on physical gas, power marketing and structured transactions for large
customers, as well as the enhancement of returns from other DTE Energy assets including natural gas
production, power plants, and pipeline and storage assets.

Our strategy for our trading business is to deliver value-added services to our customers. We
seek to manage this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our
other business segments. We focus on physical marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of
energy assets. We compete with electric and gas marketers, traders, utilities and other energy
providers. We have risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk.

Our Coal Transportation and Marketing business continues to leverage our position as one of the top
North American coal marketers and our reputation as an efficient manager of transportation assets.
Trends such as railroad and mining consolidation and the lack of certainty in developing new mines
by many mining firms could have an impact on how we compete in the future. We will continue to
work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and competitive access to coal to meet the
energy requirements of our customers.

Pipelines, Processing and Storage focuses on asset development opportunities in the
Midwest-to-Northeast region to supply natural gas to meet growing demand. We expect much of the
growth in the demand for natural gas in the U.S. to occur within the Mid-Atlantic and New England
regions. These regions currently lack the pipeline and gas storage infrastructure necessary to
deliver gas volumes to meet growing demand. Vector is an interstate pipeline that is filling a
large portion of that need, and is complemented by our Michigan storage business. Vector is
awaiting FERC approval for a 200 MMcf per day expansion of long-haul capacity scheduled to be in
service by November 2007. The Washington 10 storage facility received MPSC approval for a project,
which expands working capacity from 51.4 to 66 Bcf. This additional working gas capacity, added to
the unutilized working gas capacity previously unavailable due to lack of compression, will create
additional high deliverability firm storage service which is expected to be in service by April
2006. Another opportunity is Millennium Pipeline, in which we have a 10.5% interest. Upon
finalizing market support and receiving required federal and regulatory approvals, the Millennium
Pipeline could be in service by 2007 and would be able to transport up to 500 MMcf per day. The gas
supply for Millennium could be sourced from Michigan storage facilities or from Vector Pipeline for
consumption by the higher value markets in the Northeast U.S.

CORPORATE & OTHER

Description

Corporate & Other includes various corporate support functions such as accounting, legal and
information technology. Because these functions essentially support the entire Company, their
costs are allocated to



the various segments based on services utilized. Therefore, the effect of the allocation on
each segment can vary from year to year. Additionally, Corporate & Other holds certain non-utility
debt, assets held for sale and investments in energy related funds.

Strategy and Competition

Our energy related investment strategy is to create a profitable portfolio by investing in
companies that facilitate the creation of new businesses, expand growth opportunities for existing
businesses or enable performance improvements in our existing businesses. We seek to gain early
experience in emerging energy sectors where energy trends and technologies may create potentially
profitable opportunities. The investment portfolio consists of direct investments in energy related
companies and venture funds.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to extensive environmental regulation. Additional costs may result as the
effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are
developed and implemented. We expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility
operations through rates charged to our customers. The following table summarizes our expected
significant environmental expenditures:

Air

- Detroit Edison is subject to EPA ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit
power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In March 2005, EPA issued additional
emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze and mercury air
pollution. The new rules will lead to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. The cost to address environmental air issues
is estimated through 2018.

Water

- Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts
of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. Based on the results of
studies to be conducted over the next four to six years, Detroit Edison may be required to install
additional control technologies to reduce the environmental impact of the intake structures.

MGP Sites

- Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating
and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. The facilities,
which produced gas for heating and other uses, have been designated as MGP sites. Gas Utility
owns, or previously owned, fifteen such former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP sites, the company
is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites. As a result of these
determinations, we have recorded liabilities related to these sites. Cleanup activities associated
with these sites will be conducted over the next several years.

Detroit Edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites, including two MGP sites,
the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank
locations. The findings of



these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is expected to be
incurred over the next several years.

Non-utility –

Our non-utility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and
regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants. We are in the
process of installing new environmental equipment at our coke battery facilities in Michigan. We
expect the projects to be completed within two years. Our other non-utility affiliates are
substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements.

Item 1A. Company Risk Factors

There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE Energy’s utility and non-utility
businesses. To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy, we are
providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses.
Although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.
Each of the following risks could affect our performance.

Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.

We have generated production tax
credits from our synfuel, coke battery, landfill gas recovery and gas production operations. We
have received favorable private letter rulings on all of our synfuel facilities. All production
tax credits taken after 2001 are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If our
production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could
be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly
impact our earnings and cash flows. The value of future credits generated may be affected by new
tax legislation. Moreover, production tax credits related to generation of synfuels expire at the
end of 2007. The combination of IRS audits of production tax credits, supply and demand for
investment in credit producing activities and new tax legislation could have an impact on our
earnings and cash flows. We have also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction
with the sales of interests in our synfuel facilities.

The value of a production tax credit can vary each year and is adjusted annually by an inflation
factor as published by the IRS in April of the following year. Additionally, the value of the
production tax credit in a given year is reduced if the Reference Price of oil within the year
exceeds a threshold price and is eliminated entirely if the Reference Price exceeds a phase-out
price. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price
per barrel for domestic crude oil. For 2005, the monthly average wellhead prices were
approximately $6 lower than the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price for light, sweet crude
oil. The 2006 realized and unrealized NYMEX price was $65.08 as of February 28, 2006, equating to
an estimated Reference Price of $59, which is within the phase-out range. If during 2006 or 2007,
the annual average wellhead price for a barrel of domestic crude oil exceeds the threshold price,
our synthetic fuel business would be adversely affected for those years and, depending on the
magnitude of increases in oil prices, the adverse effect for that year could be material and could
have an impact on our synthetic fuel production plans which, in turn, may have a material impact on
our results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition.

Our estimates of gas reserves are subject to change.

We cannot assure that our estimates of our
Antrim and Barnett gas reserves are accurate. Estimates of proved gas reserves and the future net
cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by independent engineers. There are numerous
uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable
to such reserves, including factors beyond our control and that of our engineers. Reserve
engineering is a subjective
process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner.
The



accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of cash flows attributable to such
reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions regarding expenditures for future
development and exploration activities, and of engineering and geological interpretation and
judgment. Additionally, reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or
upward revisions, based upon production history, development and exploration activities and prices
of gas. Actual future production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses,
underlying information, quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such
reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information we used. In
addition, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based
on the same available data.

Failure to successfully implement new processes and information systems could interrupt our
operations.

Our businesses depend on numerous information systems for operations and financial
information and billings. DTE2 is a multi-year Company-wide initiative to improve existing
processes and implement new core information systems. We launched the first phase of our DTE2
project in 2005. Additional phases of implementation are planned for 2007. Failure to
successfully implement new processes and new core information systems could interrupt our
operations.

Michigan’s electric Customer Choice program is negatively impacting our financial performance

. The
electric Customer Choice program, as originally contemplated in Michigan, anticipated an eventual
transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged
market-based rates for their electricity. The MPSC has continued to regulate electric rates for our
customers, while alternative electric suppliers can charge market-based rates. In addition, such
regulated electric rates for certain groups of our customers exceed the cost of service to those
customers. Due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial period of electric Customer
Choice, many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers. MPSC rate orders in 2004
and 2005 have removed some of the pricing disparity. Recent higher wholesale electric prices have
also resulted in some former electric Customer Choice customers migrating back to Detroit Edison
for electric generation service. Even with the electric Customer Choice-related rate relief
received in Detroit Edison’s 2004 and 2005 orders, there continues to be considerable financial
risk associated with the electric Customer Choice program. Electric Customer Choice migration is
sensitive to market price and bundled electric service price increases.

Weather significantly affects operations

.

Deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions
affect our earnings and cash flow. Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our
assets, lowering income and cash flow. Damage due to ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can
damage our infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned
expenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be recoverable through the regulatory
process.

We are subject to rate regulation

. Electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the MPSC and
the FERC and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. We may be impacted by new
regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. New legislation,
regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates, impact our ability to
recover costs through rate increases or require us to incur additional expenses.

Our non-utility operations may not perform to our expectations.

We rely on our non-utility
operations for a significant portion of our earnings. If our current and contemplated non-utility
investments do not perform at expected levels, we could experience diminished earnings potential
and a corresponding decline in our shareholder value.

We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.

Cash flows from our utility and non-utility subsidiaries
are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities. Should a
major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, our ability to
pay interest and dividends would be restricted.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us.

Increased scrutiny of the energy
industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic performance, could result in
credit agencies reexamining our credit rating. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the
credit agencies issuing such



ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a
downgrade in our credit rating could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets
at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs. In addition, a reduction in credit rating
may require us to post collateral related to various trading contracts, which would impact our
liquidity.

Regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us.

Our businesses
follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve. Should national or regional economic
conditions decline, reduced volumes of electricity and gas we supply will result in decreased
earnings and cash flow. Economic conditions in our service territory also impact our collections of
accounts receivable and financial results.

Environmental laws and liability may be costly.

We are subject to numerous environmental
regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and
disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can significantly
increase capital spending, operating expenses and plant down times. These laws and regulations
require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other regulatory
approvals. We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address
the climate change issue. The regulatory environment is subject to significant change; therefore,
we cannot predict how future issues may impact the company.

Additionally, we may become a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a
regulatory body. We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures
related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs. There is
also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several
liability on potentially responsible parties.

Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory
process, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.

Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk.

Ownership of an operating nuclear generating
plant subjects us to significant additional risks. These risks include among others, plant
security, environmental regulation and remediation, and operational factors that can significantly
impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility. While we maintain insurance for
various nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to
cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating
plant, which may affect our financial performance.

The supply and price of fuel and other commodities may impact our financial results.

We are
dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuations and fuel
supply disruptions could have a negative impact on our ability to profitably generate electricity.
Our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas
customers. We have hedging strategies in place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity
supply prices, but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively
impacted by price fluctuations. The price of natural gas also impacts the market for other
non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.

A work interruption may adversely affect us.

Unions represent approximately 5,800 of our employees.
A union choosing to strike as a negotiating tactic would have an impact on our business. We are
unable to predict the effects a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial
performance.

Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.

Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely
produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations. As a result of unforeseen
maintenance, we
may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation.
Our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased
costs.



Our ability to access capital markets at attractive interest rates is important.

Our ability to
access capital markets is important to operate our businesses. Heightened concerns about the energy
industry, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit
our access to capital markets. Changes in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs and
negatively impact our financial performance.

Michigan tax reform may be costly

. We are a significant taxpayer in the State of Michigan. Should
the legislature change the tax laws, we could face increased taxes.

We may not be fully covered by insurance.

While we have a comprehensive insurance program in place
to provide coverage for various types of risks, catastrophic damage as a result of acts of God,
terrorism, war or a combination of significant unforeseen events could impact our operations and
economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance.

Terrorism could affect our business

. Damage to downstream infrastructure or our own assets by
terrorism would impact our operations. We have increased security as a result of past events and
further security increases are possible.

Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to additional risk

.

Events in the energy
trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy
industry as a whole. In certain situations we may also be required to post collateral to support
trading operations. We have established risk policies to manage the business.

As of December 31, 2005

Under our Bylaws, the officers of DTE Energy are elected annually by the Board of Directors at
a meeting held for such purpose, each to serve until the next annual meeting of directors or until
their respective successors are chosen and qualified. With the exception of Messrs. Ewing,
Hillegonds, Peterson and Ms. Ellyn, all of the above officers have been employed by DTE Energy in
one or more management capacities during the past five years.

Stephen E.
Ewing was elected Vice Chairman of DTE Energy on October 31, 2005 and President and
Chief Operating Officer of MichCon on April 28, 2005. He previously served as group president for
DTE Energy Gas since May 31, 2001. He joined DTE Energy having previously served as president and
chief operating officer of MCN Energy and president and chief executive officer of MichCon during
the previous five years.

Paul C. Hillegonds was elected Senior Vice President effective May 16, 2005. Mr. Hillegonds was
president of Detroit Renaissance for eight years prior to joining DTE Energy.

Bruce D. Peterson was elected Senior Vice President and General Counsel on June 25, 2002. Mr.
Peterson was a partner with Hunton & Williams in Washington, D.C. prior to joining DTE Energy.

Lynne Ellyn was elected Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer on December 31, 2001.
Ms. Ellyn returned to DTE Energy after spending a year serving as chief information officer of the
San Francisco-based Organic Online Internet media services company. She originally joined DTE
Energy in 1998 as vice president, information systems.

Pursuant to Article VI of our Articles of Incorporation, directors of DTE Energy will not be
personally liable to the Company or its shareholders in the performance of their duties to the full
extent permitted by law.

Article VII of our Articles of Incorporation provides that each current or former director or
officer of DTE Energy, or each current and former employee or agent of the Company or a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (including the heirs, executors, administrators or estate of such person), shall be
indemnified by the Company to the full extent permitted by the Michigan Business Corporation Act or
any other applicable laws as presently or hereafter in effect. In addition, we have entered into
indemnification agreements with all of our officers and
directors; these agreements set forth procedures for claims for indemnification as well as
contractually obligating us to provide indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by law.



We and our directors and officers in their capacities as such are insured against liability for
alleged wrongful acts (to the extent defined) under seven insurance policies providing aggregate
coverage in the amount of $165 million.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

We are involved in certain legal, regulatory, administrative and environmental proceedings
before various courts, arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in
the ordinary course of business. These proceedings include certain contract disputes,
environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and pending
judicial matters. We cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. We regularly
review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss. The
resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or
financial statements in the period they are resolved.

In June 2005, Detroit Edison was named as one of approximately 21 defendant utility companies in a
class action lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. Detroit Edison has
not been served with this lawsuit. The plaintiffs, a class comprised of current and prior residents
living in Ontario (and their respective family members and/or heirs), claim that the defendants
emitted and continue to emit pollutants that have harmed the plaintiffs. As a result, the
plaintiffs are seeking damages (in Canadian dollars) of approximately $49 billion for alleged
negligence, approximately $4 billion per year until the defendants cease emitting pollutants,
punitive and exemplary damages of $1 billion, and such other relief as the court deems appropriate.
Detroit Edison is not able to predict or assess the outcome of this lawsuit at this time.

At December 31, 2005, there were 177,814,429 shares of our common stock outstanding. These
shares were held by a total of 94,981 shareholders of record.

Our Bylaws nullify Chapter 7B of the Michigan Business Corporation Act (Act). This Act regulates
shareholder rights when an individual’s stock ownership reaches 20% of a Michigan corporation’s
outstanding shares. A shareholder seeking control of the Company cannot require our Board of
Directors to call a meeting to vote on issues related to corporate control within 10 days, as
stipulated by the Act. See Note 8 – Common Stock and Earnings Per Share for information concerning
the Shareholders’ Rights Agreement.

We paid cash dividends on our common stock of $360 million in 2005, $354 million in 2004 and $346
million in 2003. The amount of future dividends will depend on our earnings, cash flows, financial
condition and other factors that are periodically reviewed by our Board of Directors. Although
there can be no assurances, we anticipate paying dividends at the current rate of $0.515 per
quarter for the foreseeable future.

All of our equity compensation plans that provide for the annual awarding of stock-based
compensation have been approved by shareholders. See Note 15 — Stock Based Compensation for
additional detail. See the following table for information as of December 31, 2005.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

DTE Energy is a growing and diversified energy company with 2005 revenues in excess of $9
billion and approximately $23 billion in assets. Since 2003, our asset base has increased by 12%
and operating revenues have grown by 29%.

We are the parent company of Detroit Edison and MichCon, regulated electric and gas utilities
engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales and distribution
services throughout southeastern Michigan. We operate three energy-related non-utility segments
with operations throughout the United States.

In 2005, our utilities and Power and Industrial Projects segment generated most of our earnings.
The improvement in earnings was due to rate increases at our Michigan utilities, favorable weather
and continued asset gains from the synthetic fuel business. Earnings were also impacted by
mark-to-market losses in our Fuel Transportation and Marketing segment and losses from discontinued
operations.

Our 2005 financial performance improved over 2004. The following table summarizes our income since
2003:

The items discussed below influenced our 2005 financial performance and may affect future
results:

UTILITY OPERATIONS

Weather

- Earnings at our utility operations are seasonal and very sensitive to weather.
Electric utility earnings are dependent on hot summer weather, while the gas utility’s results are
dependent on cold winter weather. The following table explains the impact of weather relative to
30-year historical normal weather temperatures for each utility.

Electric Utility is based on cooling degree days and the Gas Utility is based on heating
degree days.

The positive impact of warmer weather was partially mitigated by the rate cap on residential
customers which prevented us from passing through increased generation and purchased power costs
incurred to serve the higher demand. Additionally, we occasionally experience various types of
storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages. Restoration
and other costs associated with storm-related power outages lowered pretax earnings by $82 million
in 2005, $48 million in 2004 and $72 million in 2003.

Receivables

- Both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables, especially
within our Gas Utility operations. The increase is attributable to economic conditions, high
natural gas prices and the lack of adequate levels of assistance for low-income customers.

We have taken aggressive actions to reduce the level of past due receivables including, increased
customer disconnections, contracting with collection agencies and working with the State of
Michigan and others to increase the share of low-income funding allocated to our customers. In
2005, we sold previously written-off accounts of $187 million resulting in a gain and net proceeds
of $6 million. The gain was recorded as a recovery through bad debt expense, which is included
within operation and maintenance expense. As a result of these factors, our allowance for doubtful
accounts expense for the two utilities decreased to $98 million in 2005 from $105 million in 2004.

The April 2005 MPSC gas rate order provided for an uncollectible tracking mechanism for MichCon. We
will file an annual application comparing our actual uncollectible expense to our designated
revenue recovery of approximately $37 million. Ninety percent of the difference from the date of
the order will be refunded or surcharged after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the MPSC.

Electric Utility

Electric rate orders —

In 2004, the MPSC issued interim and final rate orders that authorized
electric rate increases totaling $374 million, eliminated transition credits and implemented
transition charges for electric Customer Choice customers. The increases were applicable to all
customers not subject to a rate cap. The MPSC also authorized the recovery of approximately $385
million in regulatory assets, including stranded costs. As a result of increased rates, our 2005
pretax margins were higher by $116 million.

Electric Customer Choice

- Our customers have the option of participating in the electric Customer
Choice program where they can select an alternative electric supplier. Due to distorted pricing
mechanisms during the initial period of electric Customer Choice, many commercial customers chose
alternative electric suppliers. The impact of the final rate order in 2004, that increased base
rates including the recovery of lost margins and transition charges, combined with recent higher
wholesale electric prices has resulted in many former electric Customer Choice customers migrating
back to Detroit Edison for electrical generation service, partially mitigating the financial impact
of the electric Customer Choice program.

The return of customers from the electric Customer Choice program resulted in higher gross margins
during 2005. The following graph depicts the electric Customer Choice volumes:



We continue to work with the MPSC to address issues associated with the electric Customer Choice
program. In February 2005, we filed a revenue-neutral rate restructuring proposal with the MPSC
designed to adjust rates for each customer class to be reflective of the full costs incurred to
service such customers. In December 2005, the MPSC issued an order that took some initial steps to
improve the current competitive imbalance in Michigan’s electric Customer Choice program. The
December 2005 order establishes cost-based power supply rates for Detroit Edison’s full service
customers. Electric Customer Choice participants will pay cost-based distribution rates, while
Detroit Edison’s full service commercial and industrial customers will pay cost-based distribution
rates that reflect the cost of the residential rate subsidy. Residential customers pay a subsidized
below cost rate for distribution service. These revenue neutral revised rates were effective
February 1, 2006.

Coal Supply

– Our generating fleet produces in excess of 70% of its electricity from coal.
Increasing coal demand from domestic and international markets has resulted in significant price
increases. In addition, difficulty in recruiting workers, obtaining environmental permits and
finding economically recoverable amounts of new coal has resulted in decreasing coal output from
the central Appalachian region. Furthermore, as a result of environmental regulation and declining
eastern coal stocks, demand for cleaner burning western coal has increased. This increased demand
for western coal has also resulted in a corresponding demand for western rail shipping, straining
railroad capacity, resulting in longer lead times for western coal shipments.

Uranium Supply

- We operate one nuclear facility that undergoes a periodic refueling outage
approximately every eighteen months. Uranium prices have been rising due to supply concerns. In
the future, there may be additional nuclear facilities constructed in the industry that may place
additional pressure on uranium supplies and prices.

Gas Utility

Gas
final rate order

– In April 2005,
the MPSC issued a final rate order authorizing
MichCon to earn a rate of return on common equity of 11% based on a 50% debt and 50% equity capital
structure. Highlights of the order include:

•

$61 million increase in annual base rates;

•

base rate increase includes $25 million to recover safety and training costs;

•

deferral as a regulatory liability for the non-capitalized portion of negative pension expense; and

•

adoption of a tracking mechanism for uncollectible accounts receivable.

The final rate order from the MPSC denied recovery or required accounting impairment for the
following items:

•

$25 million of allocated merger interest from DTE Energy related to the acquisition of
MCN Energy;

•

$6 million of internal labor and legal costs to remediate MGP sites;

•

$5 million as a result of a change to the allocation of historical MGP insurance proceeds;



•

$6 million of computer equipment and related depreciation; and

•

$42 million impairment related to 90% of the cost of a computer billing system in place
prior to DTE Energy’s acquisition of MCN Energy. This impairment had a minimal earnings
impact on DTE Energy because a valuation allowance was established for this asset at the
time of the MCN acquisition in 2001.

Additionally, the rate order adjusted MichCon’s depreciation rates and the related revenue
requirements with no resulting impact on net income.

Gas cost recovery order

– Based on rate orders in place for 2001 and 2002, we filed a gas cost
recovery case in 2002 and recorded a $26 million regulatory asset related to unbilled volumes as of
December 31, 2001. Over time we recorded $3 million of interest associated with this regulatory
asset. In its April 28, 2005 order, the MPSC disallowed recovery and we recorded the impact of the
disallowance in the first quarter of 2005.

Natural Gas Supply

– Increased demand from natural gas power plants, 2005 hurricane related supply
disruptions, regulatory constraints and limited exploration have combined to strain existing
natural gas supplies and caused substantial increases in prices.

NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS

We anticipate significant investment opportunities within our non-utility businesses. We
employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing opportunities that will leverage our existing
assets, skill and expertise. Specifically, we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive
competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile. Assuming no
phase-out of production tax credits, the source of investment capital is the estimated cumulative
$1.2 billion we anticipate from synfuel cash flow which consists of cash from operations, asset
sales, and the utilization of current and previously earned production tax credits to reduce tax
payments. Tax credit carryforward utilization in part could be extended past 2008, if taxable
income is reduced from current forecasts. However, if oil prices remain at current levels or
continue to increase, the estimated cash flow from the synfuel business would be significantly less
and would adversely impact the success of this strategy, unless we identify alternative sources of
cash.

Power and Industrial Projects

We anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate. In determining
the markets in which to compete, we closely examine the regulatory environment, the number of
competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins. We plan to maximize the effectiveness
of our inter-related businesses as we expand from our current regional focus. As we pursue growth
opportunities, our first priority will be to achieve value-added returns.

We plan to focus on the following areas for growth:

Synfuel-related earnings —

We operate nine synthetic fuel production plants throughout the United
States. Synfuel plants chemically change coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the
Internal Revenue Code. Production tax credits are provided for the production and sale of solid
synthetic fuel produced from coal. These tax credits expire on December 31, 2007. Our synthetic
fuel plants generate operating losses which are offset by the resulting production tax credits. We
have not had sufficient taxable income to fully utilize production tax credits earned in prior
periods. As of December 31, 2005, we have $484 million in tax credit carry-forwards.



To optimize income and cash flow from our synfuel operations, we have sold interests in all nine of
our facilities, representing 91% of our total production capacity as of December 31, 2005. We will
continue to evaluate opportunities to sell additional interests in our two remaining majority-owned
plants. Proceeds from the sales are contingent upon production levels and the value of such
credits. When we sell an interest in a synfuel project, we recognize the gain as the facility
produces and sells synfuel and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have
become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. In substance, we are
receiving synfuel gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits associated with
the projects sold. Sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while
maintaining a stable income base.

The value of a production tax credit can vary each year and is adjusted annually by an inflation
factor as published by the IRS in April of the following year. The value of the production tax
credit in a given year is reduced if the Reference Price of oil within the year exceeds a threshold
price and is eliminated entirely if the Reference Price exceeds a phase-out price. The Reference
Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for
domestic crude oil. During 2005, the monthly average wellhead prices were approximately $6 lower
than the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price for light, sweet crude oil. The actual or
estimated Reference Price and beginning and ending phase-out prices per barrel of oil for 2004
through 2007 are as follows:

Beginning Phase-Out

Ending Phase-Out

Recent events have increased domestic crude oil prices, including hurricane-related supply
disruptions and continued worldwide demand. Through December 31, 2005, the NYMEX daily closing
price of a barrel of oil for 2005 averaged approximately $57, which due to the uncertainty of the
wellhead/NYMEX difference, is comparable to an approximate $51 Reference Price. For the remaining
life of the tax credits, if the Reference Price falls within or exceeds the phase-out range, the
availability of production tax credits in that year would be reduced or eliminated. Any actual tax
credit phase-out for 2006 and available tax credits, if any, will not be certain until published by
the IRS in April 2007. As of February 28, 2006, the realized and unrealized NYMEX daily closing
price of a barrel of oil was $65.08, equating to an estimated Reference Price of $59, which is
within the phase-out range. If prices remain at this level throughout 2006, we would experience a
phase-out of the production tax credits and our synthetic fuel business would be adversely
affected; this could have an impact on our synthetic fuel production plans which, in turn, may have
a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition.
However, we cannot predict with any certainty the Reference Price for 2006 or beyond.

There is legislation pending in Congress that may impact the potential phase-out of production tax
credits for 2006 and 2007. The legislation would use the prior year oil price to determine the
current year Reference Price. We are unable to predict the outcome of this legislation.

The gain from the sale of synfuel facilities is comprised of fixed and variable components. The
fixed component represents note payments of principal and interest, is not subject to refund, and
is recognized as a gain when earned and collectibility is assured. The variable component is based
on an estimate of tax credits allocated to our partners, is subject to refund based on the annual
oil price phase-out, and is recognized as a gain only when the probability of refund is considered
remote and collectibility is assured. Additionally, based on estimates of tax credits allocated,
our partners reimburse us (through the project entity) for the operating losses of the synfuel
facilities. In the event that the tax credit is phased out, we are contractually obligated to
refund to our partners all or a portion of the operating losses funded by our partners. To assess
the probability of refund, we use valuation and analysis models that calculate the probability of
surpassing the estimated lower band of the phase-out range for the Reference Price of oil for the
year. Due to the rise in oil prices, there was a possibility that the 2005 Reference Price of oil
could have reached the threshold at which production tax credits would have begun to phase-out. We



deferred all variable gains for the first three quarters of 2005. However, in the fourth quarter
of 2005, when there was persuasive evidence that the Reference Price of oil would not surpass the
estimated lower band of the phase-out range, we recognized all the variable gains related to 2005,
of which $167 million (pre-tax) were attributable to the first three quarters of 2005.

Due to changes in the agreements with certain of our synfuel partners
and the exercise of existing rights by other of our synfuels
partners, a higher percentage of the expected payments in 2006 may be
variable note payments. As a result, a larger portion of the 2006
synfuel payments may be subject to refund should a phase-out occur.
We will likely defer recognition of the quarterly variable and
certain indemnified fixed note payments in 2006 until the probability
of refund is remote and collectibility is assured.

As discussed in Note 12, we have entered into derivative and other contracts to economically hedge
a portion of our 2006 and 2007 synfuel cash flow exposure related to the risk of oil prices
increasing. The derivative contracts are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded as
an adjustment to synfuel gains. We recorded a pretax mark to market gain of $48 million during
2005. As part of our synfuel-related risk management strategy, we continue to evaluate alternatives
available to mitigate unhedged exposure to oil price volatility. These contracts, and other actions
we can take and have taken, will protect approximately 53% of our 2006 cash flow and 31% of our
2007 cash flow. As our risk management position changes due to market volatility or
legislative actions, we may adjust our hedging strategy in response to changing conditions.

In addition to entering into economic hedges, we can mitigate our exposure to a tax credit
phase-out by shutting down or reducing production at our synfuel facilities, which decreases the
amount of operating losses we generate. We regularly monitor oil prices and have created
contingency plans to cease synfuel production.

Assuming no synfuel tax credit phase-out, we expect cash flow from our synfuel business will be
approximately $1.2 billion from 2006 to 2008. If prices remain at current levels or increase
throughout 2006, synfuel production levels may be reduced, which would reduce the income and cash
flow from this business. If the Reference Price results in a complete phase out of the synfuel tax
credits for 2006, and assuming the previously discussed current level of economic hedges and an
early cessation of synfuel production to avoid operating losses, there is a potential negative
impact to net income and cash flow of $160 million and $140 million, respectively, before any
potential asset impairment and goodwill write-off.

Unconventional Gas Production

During the past year, natural gas prices have reached historically high levels. These high prices
provide attractive opportunities for our Unconventional Gas Production business segment. We are an
experienced operator with 15 years of experience in the Antrim shale in northern Michigan, and we
recently expanded our operations in the Barnett shale basin in north central Texas. Recent
leasehold acquisitions have increased our total leasehold acreage to 452,621 acres (366,693 net of
interest of others). Over the next few years, our goal is to expand our existing leasehold acreage
position and transform unproved acreage into proved reserves.

Antrim shale

– We plan to grow through the extension of existing producing areas and
acquisition of other producer’s properties. Additionally, we intend to develop existing acreage
using the latest horizontal drilling techniques and to continue to search for expansion acreage.
Some of our long-term fixed-price obligations for production of Antrim gas begin to expire in 2006.
This will create opportunities to remarket Antrim production at significantly higher current
market rates.

Barnett shale

- We anticipate significant opportunities in our existing Barnett shale acreage
and expect continued extension of producing areas within the Fort Worth Basin. We are currently in
the test and development phase for unproved and recently acquired Barnett shale acreage. We plan
to increase our acreage through small negotiated acquisitions to build scale.

Due to high natural gas prices and the potential for successes within the Barnett shale, more
capital is being invested into the region. The competition for opportunities and goods and
services may result in increased operating costs. However, our experience in the Antrim shale and
our experienced Barnett shale personnel provide an advantage in addressing potential cost
increases. We expect to invest a combined amount of approximately $100 million to $130 million in
our unconventional gas business in 2006.

Fuel Transportation and Marketing

Pipelines, Processing and Storage is in the process of expanding our storage capacity in Michigan
and expanding and building new pipeline capacity to the northeast United States. Our Coal
Transportation



and Marketing business will seek to build our capacity to transport greater amounts of western coal
and may seek to expand into coal terminals.

Significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and trading portfolio are economically
hedged. The portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory, as well as owned and
contracted natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions. Most financial instruments are
deemed derivatives, whereas the gas inventory, pipelines and storage assets are not derivatives. As
a result, this segment may experience dramatic earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to
market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. This results in gains
and losses that are recognized in different accounting periods. We incur gains or losses in one
period that are subsequently reversed when transactions are settled.

During 2005, our earnings were negatively impacted by the economically favorable decision in early
2005 to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current
price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas. The financial impact of
this timing difference has begun to reverse as the gas is withdrawn from storage in the current
storage cycle and is sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost of gas in storage. In
addition, we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and
capacity power contracts. Some of these underlying contracts are not derivatives, while the related
economic hedges are derivatives, and therefore marked to market. As a result, these transactions
produce the timing related earnings swings from period to period. We expect the timing difference
on the forward power contracts will not be fully realized until 2007.

OPERATING SYSTEM AND PERFORMANCE EXCELLENCE PROCESS

We continuously review and adjust our cost structure and seek improvements in our processes.
Beginning in 2002, we adopted the DTE Energy Operating System, which is the application of tools
and operating practices that have resulted in operating efficiencies, inventory reductions and
improvements in technology systems, among other enhancements. Some of these cost reductions may be
returned to our customers in the form of lower PSCR charges and the remaining amounts may impact
our profitability.

As an extension of this effort, in mid-2005, we initiated a company-wide review of our operations
called the Performance Excellence Process. The overarching goal has been and remains to become
more competitive by reducing costs, eliminating waste and optimizing business processes while
improving customer service. Many of our customers are under intense economic pressure and will
benefit from our efforts to keep down our costs and their rates. Additionally, we will need
significant resources in the future to invest in the infrastructure necessary to compete.
Specifically, we began a series of focused improvement initiatives within our Electric and Gas
Utilities, and our corporate support function.

The process will be rigorous and challenging and seeks to yield sustainable performance to our
customers and shareholders. We have identified the Performance Excellence Process as critical to
our long-term growth strategy. We are entering the implementation phase and expect to begin to
realize the benefits from the effort in 2006. The cost to execute the Performance Excellence
Process could result in non-recurring restructuring charges in 2006.

CAPITAL INVESTMENT

We anticipate significant capital investment across all of our business segments. Most of our
capital expenditures will be concentrated within our utility segments. Our electric utility
currently expects to invest approximately $4 billion due to increased environmental requirements
and reliability enhancement projects through 2010. Our gas utility currently expects to invest
approximately $900 million on system expansion, pipeline safety and reliability enhancement
projects through the same period. We plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital
expenditures within our regulatory rate base.

During 2005, we began the first wave of implementation of DTE2, an enterprise resource planning
system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information
systems. We anticipate



spending $165 million to $190 million over the next two years as the remaining system elements are
developed and business segments fully adopt DTE2.

In the
future, we may build a new base-load electric generating plant. The last base load plant
constructed within our electric utility service territory was approximately twenty years ago. A
recently completed study, sponsored by the MPSC, projected that Michigan may need to install 7,000
MW of additional capacity over the next ten years. We estimate that a new base-load plant will
cost between $1 billion and $2 billion.

OUTLOOK

The next few years will be a time of rapid change for DTE Energy and for the energy industry.
Our strong utility base combined with our integrated non-utility operations position us well for
long-term growth. Due to the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the repeal of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 there are fewer barriers to mergers and acquisitions of
utility companies. We anticipate greater industry consolidation over the next few years resulting
in the creation of large regional utility providers.

Looking forward, we will focus on several points that we expect will improve future performance:

Along with pursuing a leaner organization, we expect to receive an estimated $1.2 billion (assuming
no phase-out) of synfuel cash flow through 2008, which consists of cash from operations, asset
sales, and the utilization of production tax credits to reduce tax payments. Tax credit utilization
in part could be extended past 2008, if taxable income is reduced from current forecasts. However,
if oil prices remain at current levels or continue to increase, the estimated cash flow from the
synfuel business would, as a result of production tax credit phase-out, be significantly less and
would adversely impact the success of this strategy, unless we identify alternative sources of
cash.

Anticipated redeployment of this expected available cash will reduce DTE Energy’s debt and replace
the value of synfuel operations inherent in our share price by pursuing investments in targeted
energy markets. If adequate investment opportunities are not available, share repurchases may be
used to build shareholder value. We remain committed to a strong
balance sheet and financial
coverage ratios, and paying an attractive dividend.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net income in 2005 was $537 million, or $3.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of
$431 million, or $2.49 per diluted share in 2004 and net income of $521 million, or $3.09 per
diluted share in 2003. The comparability of earnings was impacted by our discontinued businesses,
DTE Energy Technologies (Dtech), Southern Missouri Gas Company and ITC, and the adoption of a new
accounting rule in 2005 and two new accounting rules in 2003. Excluding discontinued operations and
the cumulative effect of accounting changes, our income from continuing operations in 2005 was $576
million, or $3.27 per diluted share, compared to income of $461 million, or $2.66 per diluted share
in 2004 and income of $494 million, or $2.93 per diluted share in 2003. The following sections
provide a detailed discussion of our segments, operating performance and future outlook.

ELECTRIC UTILITY

Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison, which is engaged in the generation,
purchase, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 2.2 million customers in
southeastern Michigan.

Factors impacting income:

Our net income increased $127 million to $277 million in 2005 from $150
million in 2004. 2004 net income decreased $102 million from $252 million in 2003. These results
primarily reflect higher rates due to the November 2004 MPSC final rate order, return of customers
from the electric Customer Choice program, warmer weather and lower operations and maintenance
expenses in 2005, partially offset by a portion of higher fuel and purchased power costs, which
were unrecoverable as a result of residential rate caps (which expired January 1, 2006), and
increased depreciation and amortization expenses.

Gross margins

increased $189 million during 2005 and declined $73 million in 2004. Operating
revenues increased due to higher demand resulting from warmer weather in 2005 and increased rates
due to the November 2004 MPSC final rate order, partially offset by unrecovered power supply costs
as a result of residential rate caps (which expired January 1, 2006) and a poor Michigan economy in
2005. Gross margins were favorably impacted by decreased electric Customer Choice penetration,
whereby Detroit Edison lost 12% of retail sales to electric Customer Choice customers in 2005 and
18% of such sales during 2004 as retail customers migrated back to Detroit Edison as their electric
generation provider rather than remaining with alternative suppliers. The following table displays

Transmission expenses were recorded in operation and maintenance expense in 2004.

Operating revenues and fuel and purchased power costs increased in 2005 reflecting a $8.79 per
MWh (58%) increase in fuel and purchased power costs during the year. Fuel and purchased power
costs are a pass-through with the reinstatement of the PSCR mechanism, except for residential
customers whose rate caps expired in January 2006.

The increase in power supply costs was driven by higher seasonal demand, higher purchased power
rates, higher coal prices and increased power purchases due to weather and plant outages. Pursuant
to the MPSC final rate order, transmission expense, previously recorded in operation and
maintenance expenses in 2004, is now reflected in purchased power expenses. The PSCR mechanism
provides related revenues for the transmission expense.

The decline in 2004 revenues was partially offset by increased base rates resulting from the
interim and final rate orders. Revenues in 2004 were adversely impacted by reduced cooling demand
resulting from mild summer weather. In addition, operating revenues and fuel and purchased power
costs decreased in 2004 reflecting a $1.27 per MWh (8%) decline in fuel and purchased power costs.
The loss of retail sales under the electric Customer Choice program also resulted in lower purchase
power requirements, as well as excess power capacity that was sold in the wholesale market. Under
the 2004 interim and final rate orders, revenues from selling excess power reduce the level of
recoverable fuel and purchased power costs and, therefore, do not impact margins associated with
uncapped customers.

The rate orders also lowered PSCR revenues, which were partially offset by increased base rate and
transition charge revenues. Since fuel and purchased power costs are a pass-through with the
reinstatement of the PSCR in 2004, a decrease affects both revenues and fuel and purchased power
costs but does not affect margins or earnings associated with uncapped customers. The decrease in
fuel and purchased power costs is attributable to lower priced purchases and the use of a more
favorable power supply mix driven by higher generation output. The favorable mix is due to lower
purchases, driven by lost sales under the electric Customer Choice program.

Operation and maintenance

expense decreased $87 million in 2005 and increased $63 million in
2004. As a result of the MPSC final rate order, transmission and MISO expenses in 2005 are now
included in purchased power expense with related revenues recorded through the PSCR mechanism. In
addition, as a result of the MPSC final rate order, merger interest is no longer allocated from the
DTE Energy parent company to Detroit Edison. Partially offsetting the lack of merger interest
expense and the transmission expense accounting reclassification were higher 2005 storm expenses.

The 2004 increase reflects costs associated with maintaining our generation fleet, including costs
of scheduled and forced plant outages. Additionally, the increase in 2004 is due to incremental
costs associated with the implementation of our DTE2 project.



Operation and maintenance expense in both years includes higher employee pension and health care
benefit costs due to financial market performance, discount rates and health care cost trend rates,
and increased reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable, reflecting high past-due amounts
attributable to economic conditions. In addition, we accrued a refund due from the Midwest
Independent System Operator in 2004 for transmission services.

Depreciation and amortization

expense increased $117 million in 2005 and increased $50 million in
2004. The increases reflect the income effect of recording regulatory assets, which lowered
depreciation and amortization expenses. The regulatory asset deferrals totaled $46 million in 2005,
$107 million in 2004 and $153 million in 2003, representing net stranded costs and other costs we
believe are recoverable under Public Act (PA) 141. Additionally, higher 2005 sales volumes compared
to 2004 resulted in greater amortization of regulatory assets.

Asset (gains) and losses, net

increased $25 million in 2005 as a result of our sale of land near
our headquarters.

Other income and deductions

expense decreased $20 million in 2005 and increased $26 million in
2004. The 2005 decrease is due primarily to lower interest expense as a result of lower interest
rates and a favorable adjustment related to tax audit settlements. The 2004 increase is primarily
due to lower income associated with recording a return on regulatory assets, as well as costs
associated with addressing the structural issues of PA 141.

Outlook

– We continue to improve the operating performance of Detroit Edison. During the past year
we have resolved many of our regulatory issues and continue to pursue additional regulatory
solutions for structural problems within our competitive environment, mainly electric Customer
Choice and the need to adjust rates for each customer class to reflect the full cost of service.

Concurrently, we will move forward in our efforts to improve performance. Looking forward,
additional issues, such as rising prices for coal, uranium and health care, continued
under-performance of Michigan’s economy and capital spending, will result in us taking meaningful
action to address our costs while continuing to provide quality customer service. We will utilize
the DTE Operating System and the Performance Excellence Process to seek opportunities to improve
productivity, remove waste, decrease our costs, while improving customer satisfaction.

Long term, we will be required to invest an estimated $2.4 billion on emission controls through
2018. Should we be able to recover these costs in future rate cases, we may experience a growth in
earnings. Additionally, our service territory may require additional generation capacity. A new
base-load generating plant has not been built within the State of Michigan in the last 20 years.
Should our regulatory environment be conducive to such a significant capital expenditure, we may
build or expand a new base- load facility, with an estimated cost of $1 billion to $2 billion.



The following variables, either in combination or acting alone, will impact our future results:

We expect cash flows and operating performance will continue to be at risk due to the electric
Customer Choice program until the issues associated with this program are adequately addressed. We
will accrue as regulatory assets any future unrecovered generation-related fixed costs (stranded
costs) due to electric Customer Choice that we believe are recoverable under Michigan legislation
and MPSC orders. We cannot predict the outcome of these matters. See Note 4.

GAS UTILITY

Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens Fuel Gas Company (Citizens), natural
gas utilities subject to regulation by the MPSC. MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage,
transmission, distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 1.3 million residential,
commercial and industrial customers in the State of Michigan. MichCon also has subsidiaries
involved in the gathering and transmission of natural gas in northern Michigan. MichCon operates
one of the largest natural gas distribution and transmission systems in the United States. Citizens
distributes natural gas in Adrian, Michigan.

Factors impacting income:

Gas Utility’s net income increased $17 million in 2005 and declined $9
million in 2004, compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of the MPSC’s April
2005 gas cost recovery and final rate orders.

The MPSC final gas rate order disallowed recovery of 90% of the costs of a computer billing system
that was in place prior to DTE Energy’s acquisition of MCN Energy in 2001. MichCon impaired this
asset by approximately $42 million in the first quarter of 2005. This disallowance was not
reflected at the DTE Energy level since this impairment was previously reserved at the time of the
MCN acquisition in 2001.

Gross margins

increased $37 million in 2005 and increased $22 million in 2004, compared to the
prior year. Gross margins in 2005 were favorably affected by higher base rates as a result of the
interim and final gas rate orders, and revenue associated with the uncollectible expense tracking
mechanism authorized by the MPSC. In April 2005, the MPSC issued an order in the 2002 GCR
reconciliation case that disallowed $26 million representing unbilled revenues at December 2001. We
recorded the impact of the disallowance during the first quarter of 2005. Operating revenues and
cost of gas increased in 2005



reflecting higher gas prices which are recoverable from customers through the GCR mechanism. The
2004 gross margin comparison was also affected by a $26.5 million pre-tax reserve recorded in 2003
for the potential disallowance in gas costs pursuant to an MPSC order in MichCon’s 2002 GCR plan
case. See Note 4.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased $21 million in 2005 and $32 million in 2004. The
2005 increase is primarily due to the impact of the MPSC rate order that disallowed certain
environmental expenses that had been recorded as a regulatory asset and its requirement to defer
negative pension expense as a regulatory liability. For 2005, uncollectible accounts receivables
expense remained consistent with 2004, reflecting higher past due amounts attributable to an
increase in gas prices, continued weak economic conditions and inadequate government-sponsored
assistance for low-income customers. The 2005 final rate order provided revenue for an
uncollectible expense tracking mechanism to mitigate some of the effect of increasing uncollectible
expense. The increase in operation and maintenance expense was partially offset by the DTE Energy
parent company no longer allocating merger-related interest to MichCon effective in April 2005, as
a result of the disallowance of those costs in the April 2005 final rate order. The increase was
also partially offset by a decline in accruals for injuries and damages during 2005.

The 2004 period reflects higher reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and pension and
health care costs. The increase in uncollectible accounts expense reflects high past due amounts
attributable to an increase in gas prices, continued weak economic conditions and a lack of
adequate public assistance for low-income customers.

Asset (gains) and losses, net

declined $7 million in 2005 as a result of a write-off of certain
computer equipment and related depreciation resulting from the April 2005 final rate order.



Income taxes

increased by $7 million in 2005 and decreased by $9 million in 2004 due to variations
in pre-tax earnings.

Outlook

– Operating results are expected to vary as a result of factors such as regulatory
proceedings, weather, changes in economic conditions, cost containment efforts and process
improvements. Higher gas prices and economic conditions have resulted in continued pressure on
receivables and working capital requirements partially mitigated by the GCR mechanism. We believe
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates. In the April 2005 final gas
rate order, the MPSC adopted MichCon’s proposed tracking mechanism for uncollectible accounts
receivable. Each year, MichCon will file an application comparing its actual uncollectible expense
for the prior calendar year to its designated revenue recovery of approximately $37 million. Ninety
percent of the difference will be refunded or surcharged after an annual reconciliation proceeding
before the MPSC.

NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS

Power and Industrial Projects

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised of Coal-Based Fuels, On-Site Energy Projects,
Non-Utility Power Generation, Landfill Gas Recovery and Waste Coal Recovery. Coal-Based Fuels
operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from two
coke battery plants. The production of synthetic fuel from all of our synfuel plants and the
production of coke from one of our coke batteries generate production tax credits. On-Site Energy
Projects include pulverized coal injection, power generation, steam production, chilled water
production, wastewater treatment and compressed air supply. Non-Utility Power Generation owns and
operates four gas-fired peaking electric generating plants and manages and operates one additional
gas-fired power plant under contract. Landfill Gas Recovery develops, owns and operates landfill
recovery systems throughout the United States. Waste Coal Recovery uses proprietary technology to
produce high quality coal products from fine coal slurries typically discarded from coal mining
operations.

Factors impacting income

: Net income increased $129 million in 2005 and decreased $18 million in
2004, compared to 2003. These results primarily reflect higher gains recognized from selling
interests in our synfuel plants, gains and losses on synfuel hedges, and varying levels of
production tax credits.

Operating revenues

increased $256 million in 2005 and $162 million in 2004 primarily
reflecting higher synfuel sales due to increased production, and higher market prices for our coke
production. Operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and
therefore generate operating losses, which have been more than offset by the resulting production
tax credits. When we sell an interest in a synfuel project, we recognize the gain from such sale as
the facility produces and sells synfuel and



when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable
and collectibility is reasonably assured.

The improvement in 2004 synfuel revenues results from increased production due to additional sales
of project interests in 2004, reflecting our strategy to produce synfuel primarily from plants in
which we had sold interests in order to optimize income and cash flow.

Revenues from on-site energy projects increased in 2005, reflecting the addition of new facilities,
completion of new long-term utility services contracts with a large automotive company and a large
manufacturer of paper products. Revenues in 2004 include a $9 million pre-tax fee generated in
conjunction with the development of a related energy project, 50% of which was sold to an
unaffiliated partner.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased $281 million in 2005 and $108 million in 2004,
reflecting costs associated with increased synfuel production, 2005 acquisitions of three on-site
energy projects and coke operations. Partially offsetting 2004 higher synfuel operating costs was
the recording of insurance proceeds associated with an accident at one of our coke batteries.

Asset (gains) and losses, net

increased $153 million in 2005 and $101 million in 2004. The
improvements are due to increased production and sales volume from our synfuel projects. To
economically hedge our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce synfuel
sales proceeds, we entered into derivative and other contracts. The derivative contracts are marked
to market with changes in their fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains. We recorded
2005 synfuel hedge mark to market gains of $48 million, compared to 2004 mark to market losses of
$12 million. See Note 12.

Minority interest

increased $69 million in 2005 and $121 million in 2004, reflecting our partners’
share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations. The sale of interests in our synfuel
facilities during prior periods resulted in allocating a larger percentage of such losses to our
partners.

Income taxes

increased $47 million in 2005 and $313 million in 2004. The increase in 2005 reflects
higher taxable earnings, partially offset by higher production tax credits. The increase in 2004
reflects higher taxable earnings and a decline in the level of production tax credits due to the
sale of interests in synfuel facilities.

Outlook

- We may sell additional interests in our synfuel plants and take actions to protect our
expected synfuel cash flows from the risk of an oil price-related phase-out. Synfuel-related tax
credits expire on December 31, 2007.



In the third quarter of 2005, we executed an agreement to purchase five on-site energy projects and
closed on three of the projects in 2005.

Power and Industrial Projects will continue leveraging its extensive energy-related operating
experience and project management capability to develop and grow the on-site energy business. We
expect solid earnings from our on-site energy business in 2006.

Production tax credits generated by our Coal-Based Fuels and Landfill Gas Recovery businesses are
subject to the same phase out risk if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels. See Note 13.

Unconventional Gas Production

Unconventional Gas Production is primarily engaged in natural gas exploration, development and
production. Our Unconventional Gas Production business produces gas from the Antrim and Barnett
shales and sells most of the gas to the Fuel Transportation and Marketing segment.

Factors impacting income

: Net income decreased $2 million in 2005 and decreased $6 million in 2004.
The decline in 2005 is due to higher operating and Michigan severance tax expenses. The decline in
2004 is due to increased interest costs and a gain that was recognized in 2003 as a result of a
sale of a non-core asset.

Operating revenues

increased $3 million in 2005 and increased $1 million in 2004 due primarily
to higher gas prices.

Operations and maintenance expenses

increased $3 million in 2005 and increased $5 million in 2004.
Increases are associated with the addition of approximately 300 producing wells during the three
year period. The 2004 increase is also due to a $6 million pretax gain on the sale of non-core
assets recorded in 2003.

Taxes other than income

increased $4 million in 2005 due to higher severance taxes associated with
gas price increases.

Other (income) and deductions

decreased $2 million in 2005 and increased $3 million in 2004.
Interest expense was the primary contributor to the variances.

Outlook

– We expect to continue to develop our proved areas, test unproved areas and prudently add
new acreage in Michigan and Texas. During 2005 we increased our acreage holdings by 38,437 acres
(24,852 net of the interest of others) in the Antrim and Barnett shales. Results from the Barnett
shale test wells drilled during 2005 are expected during the first half of 2006. We expect to
invest a combined amount of approximately $100 million to $130 million in our unconventional gas
business in 2006.



Fuel Transportation and Marketing

Fuel Transportation and Marketing consists of DTE Energy Trading, Coal Transportation and Marketing
and the Pipelines, Processing and Storage business.

DTE Energy Trading focuses on physical power and gas marketing, structured transactions,
enhancement of returns from DTE Energy’s power plants and the optimization of contracted
natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions. Our customer base is predominantly
utilities, local distribution companies, large industrials, and other marketing and trading
companies. We enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and
hedging activities. Most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted
for under the mark-to-market method, which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and
losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives. We utilize forwards, futures,
swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as
well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines. DTE Energy Trading is integral in
providing commodity risk management services to the other unregulated businesses within DTE Energy.

Coal Transportation and Marketing provides fuel, transportation and rail equipment management
services. We specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for
energy-intensive customers. Additionally, we participate in coal trading and coal-to-power tolling
transactions, as well as the purchase and sale of emissions credits. We recently initiated a new
business line, coal mine methane extraction, in which we recover methane gas from mine voids for
processing and delivery to natural gas pipelines, industrial users, or for small power generation
projects.

Pipelines, Processing and Storage has a partnership interest in an interstate transmission
pipeline, seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field, as well as
lease rights to another natural gas storage field. The assets of these businesses are well
integrated with other DTE Energy operations.

Factors impacting income

: Net income decreased $116 million in 2005, consisting primarily of a $131
million decline at DTE Energy Trading associated with mark-to-market losses on gas storage hedges.
Net income increased $49 million in 2004, consisting primarily of a $47 million improvement at DTE
Energy Trading. The comparability of results is impacted by a $74 million one-time pretax gain from
a contract modification/termination recorded in the first quarter of 2004 and significant 2005
mark-to-market losses on derivative contracts used to economically hedge our gas in storage and
forward power contracts.

Operating revenues

increased $430 million in 2005 and increased $193 million in 2004. Both
Coal Transportation and Marketing and DTE Energy Trading experienced revenue growth in 2005 due to
higher demand, higher commodity pricing, the sale of emission credits and increased trading volume.
Comparability of 2005 to 2004 is affected because our trading operations recorded an adjustment in
2004 that increased revenue by $86 million related to the modification of a future purchase
commitment under a transportation agreement with an interstate pipeline company. See Note 13.

Coal Transportation and Marketing revenues in 2004 were affected by our strategy to produce synfuel
primarily from plants in which we had sold interests. This strategy resulted in the reduction of
synfuel



production levels. We were contractually obligated to supply coal to customers at certain
sites that did not produce synfuel as a result of our production strategy. To meet our obligations
to provide coal under long-term contracts with customers, we acquired coal that was resold to customers. The coal was sold at
prices higher than the prices at which synfuel would have been sold to these customers.

Fuel, purchased power and gas

increased $497 million in 2005 and decreased $170 million in 2004.
During 2005, our earnings have been negatively impacted by the economically favorable decision in
early 2005 to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the
current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas. We anticipate
the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse when the gas is withdrawn from storage
in the current storage cycle and is sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost of gas in
storage. In addition, we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain
physical and capacity power contracts. We expect the timing difference on the forward power
contracts will be fully realized by the end of 2007.

In 2004, our trading operations recorded a gas inventory adjustment that increased expense by $12
million related to the termination of a long-term gas exchange agreement with an interstate
pipeline company. See Note 13. Under the gas exchange agreement, we received gas from the customer
during the summer injection period and redelivered the gas during the winter heating season.

Operation and maintenance expenses

increased $114 million in 2005 and increased $262 million in

.

During 2005, our Coal Transportation and Marketing business experienced higher throughput
volumes and increased prices for coal. The increase in 2004 was due primarily to increased coal
purchases and increased lease expense.

Other (income) and deductions

for 2005 remained consistent with 2004, and decreased $25 million in
2004. The decline in 2004 is primarily due to gains recorded in 2003 from selling our 16% pipeline
interest in the Portland Natural Gas Transmission System.

Income tax provision

decreased $65 million in 2005 and increased $23 million in 2004 due to
variations in earnings.

Outlook

– We expect to continue to grow our Coal Services and DTE Energy Trading businesses in a
manner consistent with, and complementary to, the growth of our other business segments. Gas
storage and transportation capacity enhances our ability to provide reliable and custom-tailored
bundled services to large-volume end users and utilities. This capacity, coupled with the
synergies from DTE Energy’s other businesses, positions the segment to add value and mitigate
risks.

We expect to continue to grow our Pipeline, Processing and Storage business by expanding existing
assets and developing new assets. Pipelines, Processing and Storage received MPSC approval in
September 2005 and executed long-term contracts for a capacity expansion at one of our Michigan
storage fields that will facilitate an additional 14 Bcf of storage service sales starting in April
2006. Vector Pipeline has secured long-term market commitments to support an expansion project, for
approximately 200 MMcf per day, with a projected in-service date of November 2007. Vector Pipeline
expects to receive FERC approval in the second quarter of 2006. The Millennium Pipeline filed an
application for FERC approval in August 2005. In addition, Pipeline, Processing and Storage owns a
10.5% interest in the Millennium Pipeline and is currently negotiating to increase its equity
interest.

Significant portions of the Fuel Transportation and Marketing portfolio are economically hedged.
The portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory, as well as capacity positions of
natural gas storage and pipelines and power transmission contracts. The financial instruments are
deemed derivatives, whereas the gas inventory, pipelines and storage assets are not derivatives. As
a result, we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without
revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. The majority of such earnings
volatility is associated with the natural gas storage cycle, which does not coincide with the
calendar and fiscal year, but runs annually from April of one year to March of the next year. Our
strategy is to economically hedge the price risk of storage with over-the-counter forwards and
futures. Current accounting rules require the marking to market of forward



sales and futures, but
do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory. This results in gains and
losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods. We generally
anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse by the end of each storage
cycle. See “Fair Value of Contracts” section that follows.

CORPORATE & OTHER

Corporate & Other includes various corporate support functions such as accounting, legal and
information technology services. As these functions essentially support the entire Company, their
costs are fully allocated to the various segments based on services utilized. Therefore the effect
of the allocation on each segment can vary from year to year. Additionally, Corporate & Other holds
certain non-utility debt, assets held for sale, and energy related investments.

Factors impacting income

: Corporate & Other results declined $40 million in 2005, compared to a $53
million improvement in 2004. The 2005 decline was primarily a result of the parent company not
allocating merger interest to Detroit Edison and MichCon. Partially offsetting 2005 increased
expenses were reduced Michigan Single Business Taxes and gains on the sale of non-strategic assets.
The 2004 improvement was affected by a $14 million net of tax gain from the sale of 3.5 million
shares of Plug Power stock, as well as lower Michigan Single Business Taxes, resulting from tax
saving initiatives. Corporate & Other also benefited from lower financing costs.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

DTE Energy Technologies (Dtech)

- We own Dtech, which assembles, markets, distributes and
services distributed generation products, provides application engineering, and monitors and
manages on-site generation system operations. In July 2005, management approved the restructuring
of this business resulting in the identification of certain assets and liabilities to be sold or
abandoned, primarily associated with standby and continuous duty operations. We recognized a net of
tax restructuring loss of $23 million during the third quarter of 2005 primarily representing the
write down to fair value of the assets of Dtech, less costs to sell, and the write-off of goodwill.
As we execute the restructuring plan, there may be adjustments to amounts recorded related to the
impairment and exit costs. We anticipate completing the restructuring plan by mid-2006.

Southern Missouri Gas Company

-

We owned Southern Missouri Gas Company (SMGC), a public utility
engaged in the distribution, transmission and sale of natural gas in southern Missouri. In the
first quarter of 2004, management approved the marketing of SMGC for sale. As of March 31, 2004,
SMGC met the criteria of an asset “held for sale” and we have reported its operating results as a
discontinued operation. We recognized a net of tax impairment loss of approximately $7 million,
representing the write-down to fair value of the assets of SMGC, less costs to sell, and the
write-off of allocated goodwill. In November 2004, we entered into a definitive agreement providing
for the sale of SMGC. Regulatory approval was received in April 2005 and the sale closed in May
2005. During the second quarter of 2005, we recognized a net of tax gain of $2 million.

International Transmission Company

- In February 2003, we sold International Transmission Company
(ITC), our electric transmission business, to affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and
Trimaran Capital Partners, LLC. Through December 31, 2004, we recorded a gain of $58 million (net
of tax). During the second quarter of 2005, the gain was adjusted to $56 million (net of tax).

See Note 3.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we adopted additional new accounting rules for asset retirement
obligations. The cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced 2005 earnings by
$3 million.



On January 1, 2003, we adopted new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations and energy
trading activities. The cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced 2003
earnings by $27 million.

See Note 2.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

DTE Energy and its subsidiaries require cash to operate and is provided by both internally and
externally generated sources. We manage our liquidity and capital resources to maintain financial
flexibility to meet our current and future cash flow needs.

Cash Requirements

We use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our non-utility
businesses, retire and pay interest on long-term debt and pay dividends. Our strategic direction
anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in 2006 of up
to $1.2 billion. The capital needs of our utilities will increase due primarily to environmental
related expenditures. We may spend an additional $200 million to $400 million on growth-related
projects within our non-regulated businesses in 2006.

Capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in 2006, primarily as a result of
DTE2 and environmental spending. During 2005, we began the first wave of implementation of DTE2, an
enterprise resource planning system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new
core information systems. We anticipate spending $165 million to $190 million over the next two
years as the remaining system elements are developed and business segments fully adopt DTE2.

We
anticipate environmental capital expenditures of approximately $250 million in 2006 and up to
approximately $2.3 billion of future capital expenditures to satisfy both existing and proposed new
requirements.

We expect non-utility capital spending will approximate $200 million to $400 million annually for
the next several years. Capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will depend on
the existence of opportunities that meet our strict risk-return and value creation criteria.

Debt maturing in 2006 totals approximately $682 million.

We believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated
capital requirements.

Cash from Operating Activities

A majority of the Company’s operating cash flow is provided by our two utilities, which are
significantly influenced by factors such as weather, electric Customer Choice, regulatory
deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions and operating costs.

Our non-utility businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise and reflect a range
of operating profiles. The profiles vary from our synthetic fuels business, which we believe will
provide approximately $1.2 billion of cash during 2006-2008 (assuming no phase-out), to new
startups. These new start-ups include our unconventional gas and waste coal recovery businesses,
which we are growing and, if successful, could require significant investment.

Cash from
operations totaling $1.001 billion in 2005 was up $6 million from the comparable 2004 period.
The operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of over $83 million in net income, after
adjusting for non-cash items (depreciation, depletion, amortization, deferred taxes and gains),
substantially offset by a $77 million increase in working capital and other requirements. Most of
the improvement was driven by higher net income at Detroit Edison which was the result of improved
revenues and gross margin stemming from higher rates granted in the 2004 rate orders, warmer
weather, and lower customer choice penetration. The offsetting increase in working capital
requirements was driven by a $127 million PSCR under-recovery in 2005 as compared to a $112 million
over-recovery in 2004. Working capital requirements also reflect the higher cost of gas at MichCon
and our Fuel Transportation and Marketing segment. MichCon’s working capital and other
requirements were $136 million higher in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the impact of
higher gas costs. This impact was reflected by accounts receivable balances that were $198 million
higher at December 31, 2005 than the previous year at MichCon. The increase in working capital
requirements was mitigated by lower income tax payments in 2005 and



company initiatives to improve
cash flow, including better inventory management, cash sales transactions and the utilization of
letters of credit.

Our net operating cash flow in 2004 was $995 million, reflecting a $45 million increase from 2003.
The operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of over $300 million in net income, after
adjusting for non-cash items (depreciation, depletion, amortization, deferred taxes and gains), substantially
offset by a $259 million increase in working capital and other requirements. A portion of this
improvement is attributable to the change in our strategy to primarily produce synfuel from plants
in which we have sold interests. As previously discussed, synfuel projects generate operating
losses, which have been more than offset by tax credits that we have been unable to fully utilize,
thereby negatively affecting operating cash flow. Cash for working capital primarily reflects
higher income tax payments of $172 million in 2004, reflecting a different payment pattern of taxes
in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in working capital was mitigated by Company initiatives to
improve cash flow, including better inventory management, cash sales transactions, deferral of
retirement plan contributions and the utilization of letters of credit. Certain cash initiatives in
2003 lowered cash flow in 2004.

Outlook

– We expect cash flow from operations to increase over the long-term primarily due to
improvements from utility rate increases and the sales of interests in our synfuel projects,
partially offset by higher cash requirements on environmental and other utility capital as well as
growth investments in our non-utility portfolio. We are likely to incur costs associated with
implementation of our Performance Excellence Process, but we expect to realize long term cost
savings. We also may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our PSCR and GCR
costs and electric and gas accounts receivable as a result of recent MPSC orders. Gas prices are
likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable
future. We are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through
working capital improvement initiatives.

Operating cash flow from our utilities is expected to increase in 2006. Due to the structure of the
interim and final rate orders, we will begin to realize the full benefits of interim and final rate
relief in 2006 when all customer rate caps expire. Improvements in cash flow from our utilities are
also expected from better management of our working capital requirements, including the continued
focus on reducing past due accounts receivable. Our emphasis in these businesses will continue to
be cash generation and conservation.

Assuming no production tax credit phase-out, cash flows from our synfuel business are expected to
be approximately $400 million, $500 million and $300 million in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively,
including $300 million tax credit carryforward utilization by DTE Energy. The redeployment of this
cash represents a unique opportunity to increase shareholder value and strengthen our balance
sheet. We expect to use this cash to reduce debt, to continue to pursue growth investments that
meet our strict risk-return and value creation criteria and to potentially repurchase common stock
if adequate investment opportunities are not available. Our objectives for cash redeployment are to
strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios to improve our current credit rating and outlook,
and to replace the value of synfuel operations currently inherent in our share price. However, if
oil prices remain at current levels or increase throughout 2006, the expected cash flow from the
synfuel business would be less and could adversely impact the success of this strategy, unless the
Company identifies alternative sources of cash. Synfuel cash flow consists of variable and fixed
payments from partners, proceeds from option and other contracts used to protect us from risk of
loss from a tax credit phase-out and the use of prior years’ tax credit carry-forwards. Since
2004, we have spent approximately $105 million hedging our future synfuel cash flow and may spend
up to $50 million in 2006.

Our other operating non-utility businesses are expected to contribute approximately $500 million
through 2008. Remaining start-up businesses such as unconventional gas production, waste coal
recovery and distributed generation will continue to use cash in excess of their cash generation
over the next couple of years while they are being further developed. Certain of the previously
discussed cash initiatives resulted in accelerating the receipt of cash in 2005, which will have
the impact of lowering cash flow in 2006.



Cash from Investing Activities

Cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of
assets. In any given year, we will look to realize cash from under-performing or non-strategic
assets. Capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and
distribution infrastructure, comply
with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements. Capital spending within our
non-utility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion. The balance of non-utility
spending is for growth, which we manage very carefully. We look to make investments that meet
strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks and returns. All new investments
are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis. We have been
disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria.
For new business lines, we invest tentatively based on research and analysis. We start with a
limited investment, we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those
results. In any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash
flows of the Company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings.

Net cash outflows relating to investing activities increased $121 million in 2005 and $691 million
in 2004, compared to the prior year. The 2005 change was primarily due to increased capital
expenditures, partially offset by higher synfuel proceeds. Spending on growth project investments
increased $123 million in 2005 while spending on environmental projects was $44 million higher than
the 2004 period. The 2004 change was primarily due to proceeds received in 2003 totaling $758
million from the sale of ITC, interests in three synfuel projects and non-strategic assets.
Additionally, the change was due to variations in cash contractually designated for debt service.

Longer term, with the expected improvement at our utilities and assuming continued cash generation
from the synfuel business, cash flows are expected to improve. We will continue to pursue
opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion if we can find opportunities that
meet our strategic, financial and risk criteria.

Cash from Financing Activities

We rely on both short-term borrowing and long-term financing as a source of funding for our
capital requirements not satisfied by the Company’s operations. Short-term borrowings, which are
mostly in the form of commercial paper borrowings, provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily
basis. Our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities.

Our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and
maturity. We continually evaluate our leverage target, which is currently 50% or lower, to ensure
it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating. We have
completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our
long-term debt and strengthening our balance sheet. The extension of the average maturity was
accomplished at interest rates that lowered our debt costs.

Net cash used for financing activities improved $145 million in 2005 and improved $727 million in
2004, compared to the prior periods. The improvement in 2005 was primarily driven by the issuance
of common stock which resulted from the conversion of our equity security units. The change in 2004
was primarily due to higher issuances of long-term debt and levels of short-term debt borrowings
which exceeded the requirements of long-term debt redemptions.

See Note 9 – Long-Term Debt and Preferred Securities and Note 10 – Short-Term Credit Arrangements
and Borrowings for more information regarding financing activities.

Amounts available under shelf registrations include $500 million at DTE Energy, $250 million at
Detroit Edison and $200 million at MichCon. In 2006, we plan on filing new shelf registration
statements for DTE Energy and Detroit Edison.



Common stock issuances or repurchases can also be a source or use of cash. In January 2005, we
announced that the DTE Energy Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $700
million in common stock through 2008. The authorization provides Company management with
flexibility to pursue share repurchases from time to time, and will depend on future cash flows and
investment opportunities. No share repurchases were made in 2005. As of January 1, 2005, we
discontinued issuing new DTE Energy shares for our dividend reinvestment plan, which generated approximately $50 million
annually. We also contributed $170 million of DTE Energy common stock to our pension plan in the
first quarter of 2004. In August 2005, we issued 3.7 million shares of common stock in conjunction
with the settlement of the stock purchase component of our equity security units.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework
for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities. Management believes that the current credit ratings of the Company provide
sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets
not specifically related to the company may affect our ability to access these funding sources or
cause an increase in the return required by investors.

We have issued guarantees for the benefit of various non-utility subsidiaries. In the event that
our credit rating is downgraded to below investment grade, certain of these guarantees would
require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately $536 million at December 31,
2005. Additionally, upon a downgrade, our trading business could be required to restrict operations
and our access to the short-term commercial paper market could be restricted or eliminated. While
we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade, we cannot predict the outcome of current or future
credit rating agency reviews. The following table shows our credit rating as determined by three
nationally respected credit rating agencies. All ratings are considered investment grade and affect
the value of the related securities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

There are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements that require
considerable judgment. Such estimates relate to regulation, risk management and trading activities,
production tax credits, goodwill, pension and postretirement costs, the allowance for doubtful
accounts, and legal and tax reserves.

Regulation

A significant portion of our business is subject to regulation. Detroit Edison and MichCon
currently meet the criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation

. Application of this standard results in
differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and
non-regulated businesses. SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities
for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated
businesses. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in
discontinuing the application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of our businesses. If we were to
discontinue the application of SFAS No. 71 on all our operations, we estimate that the
extraordinary loss would be as follows:

Excludes securitized regulatory assets

Management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of SFAS
No. 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current
rate environment. See Note 4.

Risk Management and Trading Activities

All derivatives are recorded at fair value and shown as “Assets or 1iabilities from risk
management and trading activities” in the consolidated statement of financial position. Risk
management activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,

as amended. Through December 2002, trading activities were
accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) Issue No. 98-10,

Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities

.
Effective January 2003, trading activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133. See
Note 2.

The offsetting entry to “Assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities” is to
other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use of the derivative, how it is designated
and if it
qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair values of derivative contracts were adjusted each
reporting period for changes using market sources such as:



•

published exchange traded market data

•

prices from external sources

•

price based on valuation models

Market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts. Derivative contracts are
only marked to market to the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective,
transparent prices can be obtained. Unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions
that do not meet this criterion.

Production Tax Credits

We generate production tax credits from our synfuel, coke battery and landfill gas recovery
operations. We recognize earnings as tax credits are generated at our facilities in one of two
ways. First, to the extent we have sold an interest in our synfuel facilities to third parties, we
recognize gains as synfuel is produced and sold, and when there is persuasive evidence that the
sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Second,
to the extent we generate credits to our own account, we recognize earnings through reduced tax
expense.

All production tax credits are subject to audit by the IRS. However, all of our synfuel facilities
have received favorable private letter rulings from the IRS with respect to their operations.
Audits of five of our synfuel facilities were successfully completed in the past two years. If
production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could
be a significant write-off of previously recorded earnings from such tax credits.

Tax credits generated by our facilities were $617 million in 2005, as compared to $449 million in
2004 and $387 million in 2003. The portion of tax credits generated for our own account was $55
million in 2005, as compared to $38 million in 2004 and $241 million in 2003, with the remaining
credits generated allocated to third party partners.

Goodwill

Certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

each of our reporting units
with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired. In order to perform these impairment tests,
we must determine the reporting unit’s fair value using valuation techniques, which use estimates
of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. These cash flow valuations
involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management
regarding future performance. To the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward, the
reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill, which would
adversely impact our earnings.

As of December 31, 2005, our goodwill totaled $2.1 billion. The majority of our goodwill is
allocated to our utility reporting units, with $772 million allocated to the Gas Utility reporting
unit. The value of the utility reporting units may be significantly impacted by rate orders and
the regulatory environment. The Gas Utility reporting unit is comprised primarily of MichCon. We
have made certain assumptions for MichCon that incorporate earnings multiples used in the cash flow
valuations. These assumptions may change as regulatory and market conditions change.

We also have $41 million of goodwill allocated to the Power and Industrial Projects reporting unit.
The value of the Power and Industrial Projects reporting unit may be significantly impacted by any
phase-out of tax credits related to our synfuel business. We have assumed there will be no
phase-out of synfuel tax credits and will monitor the status of any potential phase-out and its
impact on our valuation assumptions.

During 2005 we recorded an impairment of $16 million to goodwill related to discontinuing the
operations of Dtech.



Based on our 2005 goodwill impairment test, we determined that the fair value of our remaining
operating reporting units exceed their carrying value and no impairment existed. We will continue
to monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. While we believe our
assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ from our projections.

Pension and Postretirement Costs

Our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of
factors, including rates of return on plan assets, the discount rate, the rate of increase in
health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions.

We had pension costs for qualified pension plans of $90 million in 2005, $81 million in 2004, and
$47 million in 2003. Postretirement benefits costs for all plans were $155 million in 2005, $125
million in 2004, and $118 million in 2003. Pension and postretirement benefits costs for 2005 are
calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of
return on our plan assets of 9.0%. In developing our expected long-term rate of return assumption,
we evaluated input from our consultants, including their review of asset class risk and return
expectations as well as inflation assumptions. Projected returns are based on broad equity and bond
markets. Our 2006 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation
assumption utilizing active investment management of 66% in equity markets, 25% in fixed income
markets, and 9% invested in other assets. Because of market volatility, we periodically review our
asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate. Given market conditions,
we believe that 8.75% is a reasonable long-term rate of return on our plan assets for 2006. We will
continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of return, at least
annually.

We base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a market-related
valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation
recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a three-year period. Accordingly, the
future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. We
have unrecognized net losses due to the performance of the financial markets. As of December
31, 2005, we had $6 million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the
calculation of the market-related value of assets.

The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit
obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two
highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. The yield curve approach matches projected
plan pension and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual
liability duration unique to our plans. The discount rate determined on this basis decreased from
6.0% at December 31, 2004 to 5.9% at December 31, 2005. Due to recent financial market performance,
lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates, we estimate that our 2006 pension costs
will approximate $80 million compared to $96 million in 2005 and our 2006 postretirement benefit
costs will approximate $192 million compared to $155 million in 2005. In the last several years,
we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings
impact of higher costs. Future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on
future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related
to plan design. Additionally, future pension costs for Detroit Edison will be affected by a pension
tracking mechanism, which was authorized by the MPSC in its November 2004 rate order. The tracking
mechanism provides for the recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below the amount
reflected in Detroit Edison’s base rates. In April 2005, the MPSC approved the deferral of the
non-capitalized portion of MichCon’s negative pension expense. MichCon will record a regulatory
liability for any negative pension costs, as determined under generally accepted accounting
principles.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets by one-percentage-point would
have increased our 2005 qualified pension costs by approximately $24 million. Lowering the discount
rate and the salary increase assumptions by one-percentage-point
would have increased our 2005
pension costs by approximately $10 million. Lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by
one-percentage-point



would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for
2005 by approximately $20 million.

The market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by the
financial markets. The value of our plan assets increased from $2.9 billion at December 31, 2003 to
$3.3 billion at December 31, 2004. The value at December 31, 2005 was $3.3 billion. The investment
performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize an additional minimum
pension liability, an intangible asset and an entry to other comprehensive loss (shareholders’
equity) in 2003, 2004, and 2005. The additional minimum pension liability and related accounting
entries will be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets
exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations. The recording of the minimum pension liability
does not affect net income or cash flow.

Pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years
without substantial returns in the financial markets. We made a $222 million cash contribution in
2003 and a $170 million contribution to our pension plan in the form of DTE Energy common stock in
2004. We did not make pension contributions in 2005. We contributed $80 million to our
postretirement plans in 2004. We did not contribute to our postretirement plans in 2003 and 2005.
We do not anticipate making a contribution to our qualified pension plans in 2006. At the
discretion of management, we may make up to a $120 million contribution to our postretirement plans
in 2006.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act was signed into
law. This Act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that
provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law. The
effects of the subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement benefit costs reduced
costs by $20 million in 2005 and $16 million in 2004.

See Note 14.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk
of specific customers, historical trends, economic conditions, age of receivables and other
information. Higher customer bills due to increased gas prices, the lack of adequate levels of
assistance for low-income customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase
in past due receivables. As a result of these factors, our allowance for doubtful accounts
increased in 2004 and 2005. We believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable
estimates. As part of the 2005 rate order for MichCon, the MPSC provided for the establishment of
an uncollectible accounts tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with
MichCon uncollectible expenses. However, failure to make continued progress in collecting our past
due receivables in light of rising energy prices would unfavorably affect operating results and
cash flow.

Legal and Tax Reserves

We are involved in various legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the
ordinary course of business. We regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection
with asserted or potential matters, and establish reserves when appropriate. Legal reserves are
based upon management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against
the Company. Tax reserves are based upon management’s assessment of potential adjustments to tax
positions taken. We regularly review ongoing tax audits and prior audit experience, in addition to
current tax and accounting authority in assessing potential adjustments.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Protecting the environment, as well as correcting past environmental damage, continues to be a
focus of state and federal regulators. Legislation and/or rulemaking could further impact the
electric utility



industry including Detroit Edison. The EPA and the MDEQ have aggressive programs
to clean-up contaminated property.

Electric Utility

Air

- Detroit Edison is subject to EPA ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit
power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In March 2005, EPA issued additional
emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze and mercury air
pollution. The new rules will lead to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. To comply with these requirements, Detroit
Edison has spent approximately $644 million through 2005. We estimate Detroit Edison will incur
future capital expenditures of up to $218 million in 2006 and up to $2.2 billion of additional
capital expenditures through 2018 to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control
requirements. Under the June 2000 Michigan restructuring legislation, beginning January 1, 2004,
annual return of and on this capital expenditure was deferred in ratemaking until December 31,
2005, the expiration of the rate cap period.

The EPA has ongoing enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations
of new source provisions of the Clean Air Act. Detroit Edison received and responded to information
requests from the EPA on this subject. The EPA has not initiated proceedings against Detroit
Edison. In October 2003, the EPA promulgated revised regulations to clarify new source review
provisions going forward. Several states and environmental organizations have challenged these
regulations and, in December 2003, a stay was issued until the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit
renders an opinion in the case. We cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon Detroit
Edison.

Water

- Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts
of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. Based on the results of the
studies to be conducted over the next several years, Detroit Edison may be required to install
additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the intakes. It is estimated that we will
incur up to $50 million over the next four to six years in additional capital expenditures to
comply with these requirements.

Contaminated Sites

- Detroit Edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites,
including two former MGP sites, the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and
aboveground storage tank locations. We have a reserve balance of $13 million as of December 31,
2005 for the remediation of these sites over the next several years.

Gas Utility

Contaminated Sites

- Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas
for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. Gas
Utility owns, or previously owned, 15 former MGP sites. Investigations have revealed contamination
related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each site. In addition to the MPG sites, Gas
Utility is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites. Cleanup activities
associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years. As a result of these
determinations, we have recorded liabilities of $35 million and $1 million for the MGPs and other
contaminated sites, respectively. It is estimated that Gas Utility
may incur $5 million in
expenses related to cleanup costs in 2006. While we cannot make any assurances, we believe that a
cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for the MGP sites, approved by the MPSC, will prevent
these costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

In 1993, a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism was approved by the MPSC for investigation and
remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites in excess of this reserve. Gas Utility employed
outside consultants to evaluate remediation alternatives for these sites, to assist in estimating
its potential
liabilities and to review its archived insurance policies. As a result of these studies, Gas
Utility accrued an additional liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of $35 million during
1995. During 2005, we spent approximately $4 million investigating and remediating these former MGP
sites. In December 2005, we retained multiple environmental consultants to estimate the projected
cost to remediate each



MGP site. We accrued an additional $9 million in remediation liabilities
associated with two of our MGP sites, to increase the reserve balance to $35 million at December
31, 2005.

Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of
contamination and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for
the sites and thereby affect the Company’s financial position and cash flows. However, we
anticipate the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the MPSC will prevent
environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Other

Our non-utility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing
with the protection of the environment from various pollutants. We are in the process of installing
new environmental equipment at our coke battery facilities in Michigan. We expect the projects to
be completed within two years at a cost of approximately $25 million. Our other non-utility
affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements.

Various state and federal laws regulate our handling, storage and disposal of waste materials. The
EPA and the MDEQ have aggressive programs to manage the clean up of contaminated property. We have
extensive land holdings and, from time to time, must investigate claims of improperly disposed
contaminants. We anticipate our utility and non-utility companies may periodically be included in
various types of environmental proceedings.

DTE2

In 2003, we began the development of DTE2, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system
initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems, relating to
finance, human resources, supply chain and work management. As part of this initiative, we are
implementing Enterprise Business Systems software including, among others, products developed by
SAP AG and MRO Software, Inc. The first phase of implementation occurred in 2005 in the regulated
electric fossil generation unit. Full implementation throughout the Company is not anticipated
until 2007. The conversion of data and the implementation and operation of the ERP will be
continuously monitored and reviewed and should ultimately strengthen our internal control structure
and lead to increased cost efficiencies. Although our implementation plan includes detailed testing
and contingency arrangements to ensure a smooth and successful transition, we can provide no
assurance that complications will not arise that could interrupt our operations.

We have spent approximately $210 million through the end of 2005 and expect total spending over the
life of the project to be between $375 million and $400 million. We expect the benefits of lower
costs, faster business cycles, repeatable and optimized processes, enhanced internal controls,
improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs to outweigh the expense
of our investment in this initiative.

MIDWEST INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR (MISO)

The MISO was formed in 1996 by its member transmission owners and in December 2001 received
FERC approval as a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) authorized to provide regional
transmission services as prescribed by FERC in its Order 2000. Order 2000 requires an RTO to
perform eight functions, including tariff administration, transmission system congestion
management, provision of ancillary services to support transmission operations, market monitoring,
interregional coordination and the coordination of system planning and expansion. MISO’s
independence from ownership of either
generation or transmission facilities is intended to enable it to ensure fair access to the
transmission grid, and through its congestion management role, MISO is also charged with ensuring
grid reliability. MISO’s initial provision of transmission services in December 2001 was known as
Day 1 operations.



In keeping with Order 2000, which permits RTOs to provide real-time energy imbalance services and a
market-based mechanism for congestion management, MISO, on April 1, 2005, launched its Midwest
Energy Market, or Day 2 operations, and began regional wholesale electric market operations and
transmission service throughout its area. A key feature of the Midwest Energy Market is the
establishment of Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) which provide price transparency for the sale
and purchase of wholesale electricity at different locations in the market territory. The LMP is
the market clearing price at a specific pricing location in the Midwest Energy Market that is equal
to the cost of supplying the next increment of load at that location. The value of an LMP is the
same whether a purchase or sale is made at that location. Detroit Edison participates in the
Midwest Energy Market by offering its generation on a day-ahead and real time basis and by bidding
for power in the market to serve its load. The cost of power procured from the market net of any
gain realized from generation sold into the market is included and recovered through the PSCR
mechanism. In addition, LMPs are expected to encourage new generation to locate where the power
produced is of most value to the load and is expected to identify where new transmission facilities
are needed to relieve grid congestion.

MISO is compensated for assuring grid reliability and for supporting the energy market through
FERC-approved rates charged to load. Detroit Edison became a non-transmission owning member of MISO
in compliance with section 10w (1) of PA 141. The MPSC has ordered that MISO costs charged to
Detroit Edison should be recovered through the PSCR mechanism.

FEDERAL ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005

In August 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act) was signed into law. Among other
provisions, the Energy Act:

The implementation of the Energy Act requires proceedings at the state level and development of
regulations by the FERC, as well as other federal agencies. The impact of the Energy Act on our
results of operations will depend on the implementation of final rules and cannot be fully
determined at this time.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 2— New Accounting Pronouncements for discussion of new pronouncements .

FAIR VALUE OF CONTRACTS

The following disclosures are voluntary and provide enhanced transparency of the derivative
activities and position of our trading businesses and our other businesses.

We use the criteria in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

as amended and interpreted, to determine if certain
contracts must be accounted for as derivative instruments. The rules for determining whether a
contract meets the criteria for derivative accounting are numerous and complex. Moreover,
significant judgment is required to determine whether a contract requires derivative accounting,
and similar contracts can sometimes be accounted for differently. If a contract is accounted for
as a derivative instrument, it is recorded in the
financial statements as “assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities”, at the
fair value of the contract. The recorded fair value of the contract is then adjusted quarterly to
reflect any change in the fair value of the contract, a practice known as mark to market (MTM)
accounting.



Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms-length
transaction. To determine the fair value of contracts accounted for as derivative instruments, we
use a combination of quoted market prices and mathematical valuation models. Valuation models
require various inputs, including forward prices, volatility, interest rates, and exercise periods.

Contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments are power, gas and oil forwards, futures,
options and swaps, as well as foreign currency contracts. Items we do not generally account for as
derivatives (and which are therefore excluded from the following tables) include gas inventory, gas
storage and transportation arrangements, full-requirements power contracts and gas and oil
reserves. As subsequently discussed, we have fully reserved the value of derivative contracts
beyond the liquid trading timeframe thereby not impacting income.

The subsequent tables contain the following four categories represented by their operating
characteristics and key risks.

•

“Proprietary Trading” represents derivative activity transacted
with the intent of taking a view, capturing market price changes,
or putting capital at risk. This activity is speculative in
nature as opposed to hedging an existing exposure.

•

“Structured Contracts” represents derivative activity transacted
with the intent to capture profits by originating substantially
hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers, utilities,
retail aggregators and alternative energy suppliers. Although
transactions are generally executed with a buyer and seller
simultaneously, some positions remain open until a suitable
offsetting transaction can be executed.

•

“Economic Hedges” represents derivative activity associated with
assets owned and contracted by DTE Energy, including forward sales
of gas production and trades associated with owned transportation
and storage capacity. Changes in the value of derivatives in this
category economically offset changes in the value of underlying
non-derivative positions, which do not qualify for fair value
accounting. The difference in accounting treatment of derivatives
in this category and the underlying non-derivative positions can
result in significant earnings volatility as discussed in more
detail in the preceding Results of Operations section.

•

“Other Non-Trading Activities” primarily represent derivative
activity associated with our Michigan gas reserves and synfuel
operations. A substantial portion of the price risk
associated with the gas reserves has been mitigated through 2013.
Changes in the value of the hedges are recorded as “assets or
liabilities from risk management and trading activities”, with an
offset in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges
are deemed effective. Oil-related derivative contracts have been
executed to economically hedge cash flow risks related to
underlying, non-derivative synfuel related positions through 2007.
The amounts shown in the following tables exclude the value of the
underlying gas reserves and synfuel proceeds including changes
therein.

Maturity of Fair Value of MTM Energy Contract Net Assets

We fully reserve all unrealized gains and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading
timeframe. Our intent is to recognize MTM activity only when pricing data is obtained from active
quotes and published indexes. Actively quoted and published indexes include exchange traded (i.e.,
NYMEX) and over-the-counter positions for which broker quotes are available. Although the NYMEX
has currently quoted prices for the next 72 months, broker quotes for gas and power are generally
available for 18 and 24 months into the future, respectively, we fully reserve all unrealized gains
and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading timeframe and which therefore do not impact
income.

As a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting principles, the tables above do not
include the expected favorable earnings impacts of certain non-derivative gas storage and power
contracts. We entered into economically favorable transactions in early 2005 to delay previously
planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an
increase in the forward price for natural gas. We anticipate the financial impact of this timing
difference will reverse when the gas is withdrawn from storage in the current storage cycle and is
sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost



of gas in storage. In addition, we entered into
forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts. We
expect the timing difference on the forward power contracts will be fully realized by the end of
2007.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Commodity Price Risk

DTE Energy has commodity price risk arising from market price fluctuations in conjunction with
the anticipated purchases of coal, uranium, and electricity to meet its obligations during periods
of peak demand. We also are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations on gas sale and
purchase contracts, gas production and gas inventories. To limit our exposure to commodity price
fluctuations, we have entered into a series of electricity and gas futures, forwards, option and
swap contracts. Commodity price risk associated with our electric and gas utilities is limited due
to the PSCR and GCR mechanisms. See Note 1.

Our Coal-Based Fuels and Landfill Gas Recovery businesses are also subject to crude oil price risk.
As previously discussed, production tax credits generated by DTE Energy’s synfuel, coke battery and
landfill gas recovery operations are subject to phase-out if domestic crude oil prices reach
certain levels. We have entered into a series of derivative contracts for 2006 through 2007 to
economically hedge the impact of oil prices on a portion of our synfuel cash flow.

See Note 12.

Credit Risk

Bankruptcies

We purchase and sell electricity, gas, coal, coke and other energy products from and to numerous
companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy, retail and other industries. Certain of our
customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code. We
regularly review contingent matters relating to these customers and our purchase and sale contracts
and we record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss. We believe our
previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss. The final resolution of these matters
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Other

We engage in business with customers that are non-investment grade. We closely monitor the
credit ratings of these customers and, when deemed necessary, we request collateral or guarantees
from such customers to secure their obligations.



We utilize both external and internally generated credit assessments when determining the
credit quality of our trading counterparties. The following table displays the credit quality of
our trading counterparties as of December 31, 2005:

(1)

This category includes counterparties with minimum credit ratings of Baa3 assigned by
Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and BBB- assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Group
(Standard & Poor’s). The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category
represented 29% of the total gross credit exposure.

(2)

This category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment
grade. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this category represented less
than 5% of the total gross credit exposure.

(3)

This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody’s or Standard &
Poor’s, but are considered investment grade based on DTE Energy’s evaluation of the
counterparty’s creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this
category represented 7% of the total gross credit exposure.

(4)

This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody’s or Standard &
Poor’s, and are considered non-investment grade based on DTE Energy’s evaluation of the
counterparty’s creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures combined for this
category represented less than 1% of the gross credit exposure.

Interest Rate Risk

DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and
preferred securities. In order to manage interest costs, we use treasury locks and interest rate
swap agreements. Our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury
rates, commercial paper rates and London Inter-Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). As of December 31, 2005,
the Company has a floating rate debt to total debt ratio of approximately 15% (excluding
securitized debt).

Foreign Currency Risk

DTE Energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations
associated with fixed priced contracts. These contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and
are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for long-term transportation capacity.
To limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, we have entered into a series of currency
forward contracts through 2008. Additionally, we may enter into fair value currency hedges to
mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans.

Summary of Sensitivity Analysis

We performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate the fair values of our commodity contracts,
long-term debt instruments and foreign currency forward contracts. The sensitivity analysis
involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at December 31, 2005 by a hypothetical 10% and
calculating the resulting change in the fair values. The results of the sensitivity analysis
calculations follow:

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

Management of the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of DTE Energy’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2005, which is the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures are effective in
ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and procedures,
management cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of its disclosure controls and
procedures will be attained.

(b) Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control system was designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that control may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December
31, 2005, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those
criteria.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting has been audited by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.

(c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting

The Company has established a formal assessment process and related procedures to evaluate the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting using criteria specified by COSO. The
assessment process is comprehensive in scope, utilizes internal and external resources and involves
many individuals at various levels of the Company in the design, testing and evaluation of internal
control.



As part of the evaluation and assessment process, the Company has been improving the design and
operating effectiveness of many entity-level and process-level controls. Control testing and
remediation activities provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that a material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting will be avoided. The inherent limitations of our current
internal controls, a portion of which are manual by their nature, contribute to the potential for
control deficiencies. Management does not believe any areas requiring further improvement
constitute a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005.

On October 1, 2005, DTE Energy’s Fuel Transportation and Marketing unit completed its
implementation of a deal capture and risk management system which impacted various processes and
controls related to transaction capture, confirmation, transaction valuation and risk management.
The final implementation of power transactions replaced outdated legacy computer systems. In
connection with the implementation of this system, DTE Energy has implemented new processes and
modified existing processes to facilitate added efficiencies and system-based controls. The impact
of the new system may be considered a material change in internal controls over financial
reporting. With the exception of this change, there has been no change in the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2005 that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s report on
internal control over financial reporting, that DTE Energy Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2005




and for the year then ended, and the financial statement schedule; and our report dated March 7,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company:

We have audited the consolidated statement of financial position of DTE Energy Company and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of DTE Energy Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements of the Company taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with the required
adoption of certain new accounting principles, in 2005 the Company changed its method of accounting
for asset retirement obligations and in 2003 the Company changed its method of accounting for asset
retirement obligations, energy trading contracts and gas inventories.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated March 7, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

DTE Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 — SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate Structure

DTE Energy owns the following businesses:

•

The Detroit Edison Company (Detroit Edison), an electric utility engaged in the
generation, purchase, distribution and sale of electric energy to approximately 2.2 million
customers in southeast Michigan;

•

Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon), a natural gas utility engaged in the
purchase, storage, transmission and distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately
1.3 million customers throughout Michigan; and

•

Other non-utility subsidiaries engaged in a variety of energy related businesses such as
synfuels, energy services, natural gas exploration and production, energy marketing and
trading, coal transportation and gas storage and transportation.

Detroit Edison and MichCon are regulated by the MPSC. The FERC regulates certain activities of
Detroit Edison’s business as well as various other aspects of businesses under DTE Energy. In
addition, we are regulated by other federal and state regulatory agencies including the NRC, the
EPA and MDEQ.

References in this report to “we,” “us,” “our” or “Company” are to DTE Energy and its subsidiaries,
collectively.

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in which we have
controlling influence. Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method
when the company is able to influence the operating policies of the investee. Non-majority owned
investments include investments in limited liability companies, partnerships or joint ventures.
When we do not influence the operating policies of an investee, the cost method is used. We
eliminate all intercompany balances and transactions.

For entities that are considered variable interest entities, we apply the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 46-R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.

For a detailed discussion of FIN 46-R, see Note 2.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to use
estimates and assumptions that impact reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from
our estimates.

We reclassified certain prior year balances to match the current year’s financial statement
presentation.

Revenues

Revenues from the sale and delivery of electricity, and the sale, delivery and storage of
natural gas are recognized as services are provided. Detroit Edison and MichCon record revenues for
electric and gas provided but unbilled at the end of each month.

Detroit Edison’s accrued revenues include a component for the cost of power sold that is
recoverable through the PSCR mechanism. MichCon’s accrued revenues include a component for the cost
of gas sold that is recoverable through the GCR mechanism. Annual PSCR and GCR proceedings before
the MPSC permit Detroit Edison and MichCon to recover prudent and reasonable supply costs. Any
overcollection or undercollection of costs, including interest, will be reflected in future rates.
Prior to 2004, Detroit Edison’s



retail rates were frozen under Public Act (PA) 141. Accordingly,
Detroit Edison did not accrue revenues under the PSCR mechanism prior to 2004. See Note 4.

Non-utility businesses recognize revenues as services are provided and products are delivered. Our
Fuel Transportation and Marketing segment records in revenues net unrealized derivative gains and
losses on energy trading contracts, including those to be physically settled.

Gains from Sale of Interests in Synthetic Fuel Facilities

Through December 2005, we have sold interests in all of our synthetic fuel production plants,
representing approximately 91% of our total production capacity. Proceeds from the sales are
contingent upon production levels, the production qualifying for production tax credits, and the
value of such credits. Production tax credits are subject to phase-out if domestic crude oil
prices reach certain levels. See Note 13 for further discussion. We recognize gains from the sale
of interests in the synfuel facilities as synfuel is produced and sold, and when there is
persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is
reasonably assured. Until the gain recognition criteria are met, gains from selling interests in
synfuel facilities are deferred. It is possible that gains will be deferred in the first, second
and/or third quarters of each year until there is persuasive evidence that no tax credit phase out
will occur for the applicable calendar year. This could result in shifting earnings from earlier
quarters to later quarters of a calendar year. We have recorded pre-tax gains from the sale of
interests in synthetic fuel facilities totaling $367 million, $219 million and $83 million during
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The gain from the sale of synfuel facilities is comprised of fixed and variable components. The
fixed component represents note payments of principal and interest, is not subject to refund, and
is recognized as a gain when earned and collectibility is assured. The variable component is based
on an estimate of tax credits allocated to our partners, is subject to refund based on the annual
oil price phase out, and is recognized as a gain only when the probability of refund is considered
remote and collectibility is assured. In the event that the tax credit is phased-out, we are
contractually obligated to refund to our partners an amount equal to all or a portion of the
operating losses funded by our partners. To assess the probability of refund, we use valuation and
analyst models that calculate the probability of surpassing the estimated lower band of the
phase-out range for the Reference Price of oil for the year. Due to the rise in oil prices, there
is a possibility that the Reference Price of oil could reach the threshold at which production tax
credits begin to phase out.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is the change in common shareholders’ equity during a period from
transactions and events from non-owner sources, including net income. As shown in the following
table, amounts recorded to other comprehensive income at December 31, 2005 include: unrealized
gains and losses from derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, unrealized gains and losses on
available for sale securities and, minimum pension liabilities

Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and temporary investments
purchased with remaining maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash consists of funds held
to satisfy requirements of certain debt and partnership operating agreements. Restricted cash is
classified as a current asset as all restricted cash is designated for interest and principal
payments due within one year.



Inventories

We value fuel inventory and materials and supplies at average cost.

Gas inventory at MichCon is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. At December 31,
2005, the replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the $119 million LIFO cost by $496
million. At December 31, 2004, the replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the $89
million LIFO cost by $330 million. During 2004, MichCon liquidated 5.7 billion cubic feet of prior
years’ LIFO layers. The liquidation benefited 2004 cost of gas by approximately $7 million, but
had no impact on earnings as a result of the GCR mechanism.

Our Fuel Transportation and Marketing segment uses the average cost method for its gas in
inventory.

Property is stated at cost and includes construction-related labor, materials, overheads and
an allowance for funds used during construction. The cost of properties retired, less salvage, at
Detroit Edison and MichCon is charged to accumulated depreciation.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred, except for Fermi 2.
Approximately $25 million of expenses related to the anticipated Fermi 2 refueling outage scheduled
for 2006 were accrued at December 31, 2005. Amounts are being accrued on a pro-rata basis over an
18-month period that began in November 2004. We have utilized the accrue-in-advance policy for
nuclear refueling outage costs since the Fermi 2 plant was placed in service in 1988. This method
also matches the regulatory recovery of these costs in rates set by the MPSC.



We base depreciation provisions for utility property at Detroit Edison and MichCon on straight-line
and units of production rates approved by the MPSC. The composite depreciation rate for Detroit
Edison was 3.4% in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The composite depreciation rate for MichCon was 3.2%,
3.6%, and 3.5% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The average estimated useful life for each class of utility property, plant and equipment as of
December 31, 2005 follows:

Estimated Useful Lives in Years

Utility

Generation

Distribution

Transmission

Electric



N/A

Gas

N/A



Non-utility property is depreciated over its estimated useful life using straight-line,
declining-balance or units-of-production methods.

We credit depreciation, depletion and amortization expense when we establish regulatory assets for
stranded costs related to the electric Customer Choice program and deferred environmental
expenditures. We charge depreciation, depletion and amortization expense when we amortize the
regulatory assets. We credit interest expense to reflect the accretion income on certain regulatory
assets.

Gas Production

We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for investments in gas properties.
Under this method of accounting, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and
development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has
found proved reserves. If an exploratory well has not found proved reserves, the costs of drilling
the well are expensed. The costs of development wells are capitalized, whether productive or
nonproductive. Geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying
and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred. An impairment loss is recorded to the
extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties, on a property-by-property basis, are
considered not to be realizable. An impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of
proved gas properties exceed the aggregate related undiscounted future net revenues. Depreciation,
depletion and amortization of proved gas properties are determined using the units-of-production
method.

Long-Lived Assets

Our long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds the expected future cash flows generated by the asset, an impairment loss is
recognized resulting in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Intangible Assets, Including Software Costs

Our intangible assets consist primarily of software. We capitalize the costs associated with
computer software we develop or obtain for use in our business. We amortize intangible assets on a
straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, ranging from 3 to 30 years. Intangible
assets amortization expense was $41 million in 2005, $43 million in 2004 and $40 million in 2003.
The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets at December 31, 2005
were $531 million and $167 million, respectively. The gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization of intangible assets at December 31, 2004 were $445 million and $151 million,
respectively. Amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to be $46 million annually for
2006 through 2010.



Excise and Sales Taxes

We record the billing of excise and sales taxes as a receivable with an offsetting payable to
the applicable taxing authority, with no impact on the consolidated statement of operations.

Deferred Debt Costs

The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the life
of each debt issue. In accordance with MPSC regulations applicable to our electric and gas
utilities, the unamortized discount, premium and expense related to debt redeemed with a
refinancing are amortized over the life of the replacement issue. Discount, premium and expense on
early redemptions of debt associated with non-utility operations are charged to earnings.

Insured and Uninsured Risks

Our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks. Our
insurance policies cover risk of loss from property damage, general liability, workers’
compensation, auto liability and directors’ and officers’ liability. Under our risk management
policy, we self-insure portions of certain risks up to specified limits, depending on the type of
exposure. We have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported liability
prepared annually and adjust our reserves for self-insured risks as appropriate.

Stock-Based Compensation

We have a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described in Note 15. The plan
permits the awarding of various stock awards, including options, restricted stock and performance
shares. We account for stock awards under the plan under the
recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board
(APB) No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and
follow the nominal vesting period approach for awards with retirement
eligibility provisions. This approach differs from the
non-substantive vesting period approach required by SFAS 123-R,

Share-Based Payments.

Upon adoption of SFAS 123-R, we will
apply the non-substantive vesting period approach for recognizing
compensation cost for all newly granted awards with retirement
eligibility provisions. No compensation cost related to stock options is reflected in earnings, as all options
granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date
of grant. The recognition provisions under SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
require the recording of compensation expense for stock options equal to their fair value at date
of grant as determined using an option pricing model. The following table illustrates the effect
on net income and earnings per share if we had recorded compensation expense for options granted
under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

We generally classify investments in debt and equity securities as either trading or
available-for-sale and have recorded such investments at market value with unrealized gains or
losses included in earnings or in other comprehensive income or loss, respectively. Changes in the
fair value of nuclear decommissioning-related investments are recorded as adjustments to regulatory
assets or liabilities. See Note 5.



Investment in Plug Power

We own 8.8 million shares of Plug Power Inc. We account for our investment under the cost
method of accounting. We record our investment at market value and account for unrealized gains and
losses in other comprehensive income or loss. In December 2005, we contributed 1.8 million shares
of Plug Power to the DTE Energy Foundation that resulted in a gain of approximately $1 million due
to related tax effects. In May 2004, we sold 3.5 million shares of Plug Power stock and recorded a
gain of approximately $14 million (net of taxes).

NOTE 2 — NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Energy Trading Activities

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98-10,

Accounting for Contracts Involved in
Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities

, companies were required to use mark-to-market
accounting for contracts utilized in energy trading activities. EITF Issue No. 98-10 was rescinded
in October 2002, and energy trading contracts must now be reviewed to determine if they meet the
definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

. SFAS No. 133 requires all derivatives to be recognized in the statement of financial
position as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. SFAS No. 133 also requires
that changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge
accounting criteria are met. Energy trading contracts not meeting the definition of a derivative
are accounted for under settlement accounting, effective October 25, 2002 for new contracts and
effective January 1, 2003 for existing contracts. Derivative contracts are only marked to market to
the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective, transparent prices can be
obtained. Unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions that do not meet the
criteria.

Additionally, inventory utilized in energy trading activities accounted for under the fair value
method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43 is no longer
permitted. Our Fuel Transportation and Marketing segment uses gas inventory in its trading
operations and switched from the fair value method to the average cost method in January 2003.

Effective January 1, 2003, we no longer applied EITF Issue No. 98-10 to energy contracts and ARB
No. 43 to gas inventory. As a result of discontinuing the application of these accounting
principles, we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change that reduced net income in 2003 by
$16 million after-tax.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

In January 2003, FIN 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51,

was issued and requires an investor with a majority of
the variable interests (primary beneficiary) in a variable interest entity to consolidate the
assets, liabilities and results of operations of the entity. A variable interest entity is an
entity in which the equity investors do not have controlling interests, the equity investment at
risk is insufficient to finance the entity’s activities without receiving additional subordinated
financial support from other parties, or equity investors do not share proportionally in gains or
losses.

In October 2003 and December 2003, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FIN 46-6 and FIN 46-Revised
(FIN 46-R), respectively, which clarified and replaced FIN 46 and also provided for the deferral of
the effective date of FIN 46 for certain variable interest entities. We have evaluated all of our
equity and non-equity interests and have adopted all current provisions of FIN 46-R. The adoption
of FIN 46-R did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Medicare Act Accounting

In December 2003, the

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

(Medicare Act) was signed into law. The Medicare Act provides for a non-taxable federal subsidy to
sponsors of retiree



health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least “actuarially
equivalent” to the benefit established by law. We elected at that time to defer the provisions of
the Medicare Act, and its impact on our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net
periodic postretirement benefit cost, pending the issuance of specific authoritative accounting
guidance by the FASB.

In May 2004, FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 106-2 was issued on accounting for the effects of the
Medicare Act. The guidance in this FSP is applicable to sponsors of single-employer defined benefit
postretirement health care plans for which (a) the employer has concluded the prescription drug
benefits available under the plan to some or all participants are “actuarially equivalent” to
Medicare Part D and thus qualify for the subsidy under the Medicare Act and (b) the expected
subsidy will offset or reduce the employer’s share of the cost of the underlying postretirement
prescription drug coverage on which the subsidy is based. We believe we qualify for the subsidy
under the Medicare Act and the expected subsidy will partially offset our share of the cost of
postretirement prescription drug coverage.

In June 2004, we adopted FSP No. 106-2, retroactive to January 1, 2004. As a result of the
adoption, our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related to benefits
attributed to past service was reduced by approximately $95 million and was accounted for as an
actuarial gain. The effects of the subsidy reduced net postretirement costs by $20 million in 2005
and $16 million in 2004.

Stock Based Payments

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123-R,

Stock Based Payments,

which established the
accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges equity instruments for goods or services.
SFAS No. 123-R was effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005 with
earlier adoption encouraged. In April 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delayed the
effective date by requiring implementation beginning in the next fiscal year that begins after June
15, 2005. We adopted SFAS No. 123-R effective January 1, 2006. Based on historical levels of stock
based payments, we estimate that the new standard will reduce net income by approximately $5
million to $10 million per year.

Asset Retirement Obligations

On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,

which requires the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in
which it is incurred. We identified a legal retirement obligation for the decommissioning costs for
our Fermi 1 and Fermi 2 nuclear plants. To a lesser extent, we have retirement obligations for our
synthetic fuel operations, gas production facilities, asphalt plant, gas gathering facilities and
various other operations.

On December 31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation FIN No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations

,

an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.

FIN 47 clarifies that the
term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, refers to a legal
obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement
are conditional on a future event. FIN 47 also clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a
liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if fair
value can be reasonably estimated. The accounting for FIN 47 uses the same methodology as SFAS 143.
When a new liability is recorded, an entity will capitalize the costs of the liability by
increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its
present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity settles the obligation for its recorded
amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement.

As to regulated operations, we believe that adoptions of SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 result primarily
in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset retirement costs that we are currently
recovering in rates. We will be deferring such differences under SFAS No. 71,

Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation

.



As a result of adopting FIN 47 on December 31, 2005, we identified conditional retirement
obligations for gas pipeline retirement costs and disposal of asbestos at certain of our power
plants. To a lesser extent, we have conditional retirement obligations at certain service centers,
compressor and gate stations, and PCB disposal costs within transformers and circuit breakers. We
recorded a plant asset of $26 million with offsetting accumulated depreciation of $14 million, and
an asset retirement obligation liability of $124 million. We also recorded a cumulative effect
amount related to utility operations as a reduction to a regulatory liability of $108 million and a
cumulative effect charge against earnings of $3 million, after-tax in 2005.

If we had applied FIN 47 to prior periods, we would have recorded asset retirement obligations of
$123 million and $121 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, with an immaterial
effect on earnings.

No liability has been recorded with respect to lead-based paint, as the quantities of lead-based
paint are unknown. In addition, there is no incremental cost to demolitions of lead-based paint
facilities vs. non-lead based paint facilities and no regulations currently exist requiring any
type of special disposal of items containing lead-based paint.

Ludington Hydroelectric Power Plant has an indeterminate life and no legal obligation currently
exists to decommission the plant at some future date. Substations, manholes and certain other
distribution assets within Detroit Edison have an indeterminate life, therefore, no liability has
been recorded for this asset.

A reconciliation of the asset retirement obligation for 2005 follows:

NOTE 3 — DISPOSITIONS

DTE Energy Technologies (Dtech)

—

Discontinued Operation

We own Dtech, which assembles, markets, distributes and services distributed generation
products, provides application engineering, and monitors and manages on-site generation system
operations. In July 2005, management approved the restructuring of this business resulting in the
identification of certain assets and liabilities to be sold or abandoned, primarily associated with
standby and continuous duty operations. The systems monitoring business and certain other
operations are planned to be retained. We anticipate completing the restructuring plan by mid-2006.

During the third quarter of 2005, the restructuring plan met criteria to classify the assets as
“held for sale.” Accordingly, we recognized a net of tax restructuring loss of $23 million
during the third quarter of 2005 primarily representing the write down to fair value of the assets
of Dtech, less costs to sell, and the write-off of goodwill of
$16 million. After the restructuring charge, Dtech
assets are $6 million, consisting primarily of receivables and inventory, and liabilities are $6
million at December 31, 2005.

As shown in the following table, we have reported the business activity of Dtech as a discontinued
operation. The amounts include the impairment loss recorded in the third quarter of 2005 and
exclude general corporate overhead costs and operations that are to be retained:

Southern Missouri Gas Company — Discontinued Operation

We owned Southern Missouri Gas Company (SMGC), a public utility engaged in the distribution,
transmission and sale of natural gas in southern Missouri. In the first quarter of 2004, management
approved the marketing of SMGC for sale. As of March 31, 2004, SMGC met the SFAS No. 144 criteria
of an asset “held for sale” and we reported its operating results
as a discontinued operation. We recognized a net of tax impairment loss in 2004 of approximately $7
million, representing the write-down to fair value of the assets of SMGC, less costs to sell, and
the write-off of allocated goodwill. In November 2004, we entered into a definitive agreement
providing for the sale of SMGC. Regulatory approval was received in April 2005 and the sale was
closed in May 2005. During the second quarter of 2005, we recognized a net of tax gain of $2
million.

International Transmission Company — Discontinued Operation

In February 2003, we sold ITC, our electric transmission business, for $610 million to
affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Trimaran Capital Partners, LLC. The sale generated
a preliminary net of tax gain of $63 million in 2003. The gain was net of transaction costs, the
portion of the gain that was refundable to customers and the write off of approximately $44 million
of allocated goodwill. The gain was lowered to $58 million in 2004 under the MPSC’s November 2004
final rate order that resulted in a revision of the applicable transaction costs and customer
refund. During 2005, the net of tax gain was adjusted to $56 million.

We have reported the operations of ITC, from January 1, 2003 through February 28, 2003, as a
discontinued operation as shown in the following table:

Detroit Edison’s Steam Heating Business

In January 2003, we sold Detroit Edison’s steam heating business to Thermal Ventures II, LP.
Due to the continuing involvement of Detroit Edison in the steam heating business, including the
commitment to purchase steam, fund certain capital improvements and guarantee the buyer’s credit
facility, we recorded a net of tax loss of approximately $14 million in 2003. As a result of
Detroit Edison’s continuing involvement, this transaction is not considered a sale for accounting
purposes. See Note 13.



NOTE 4 — REGULATORY MATTERS

Regulation

Detroit Edison and MichCon are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which
issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of generating
facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting and operating-related matters.
Detroit Edison is also regulated by the FERC with respect to financing authorization and wholesale
electric activities.

As subsequently discussed in the “Electric Industry Restructuring” section, Detroit Edison’s rates
were frozen through 2003 and capped for small business customers through 2004 and for residential
customers through 2005 as a result of Public Act (PA) 141. However, Detroit Edison was allowed to
defer certain costs to be recovered once rates could be increased, including costs incurred as a
result of changes in taxes, laws and other governmental actions.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

Detroit Edison and MichCon apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation,

to their regulated operations. SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of
regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue
and expense in non-regulated businesses. Continued applicability of SFAS No. 71 requires that rates
be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and be charged to and
collected from customers. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment
could result in the Company discontinuing the application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of its
utility businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any regulatory asset or
liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management believes that
currently available facts support the continued application of SFAS No. 71 to Detroit Edison and
MichCon.

Electric Rate Restructuring Proposal

In February 2005, Detroit Edison filed a rate restructuring proposal with the MPSC to
restructure its electric rates and begin phasing out subsidies within the current pricing
structure. In December 2005, the MPSC issued an order that did not provide for the comprehensive
realignment of the existing rate structure that
Detroit Edison requested in its rate restructuring proposal. The MPSC order did take some initial
steps to improve the current competitive imbalance in Michigan’s electric Customer Choice program.
The December 2005 order establishes cost-based power supply rates for Detroit Edison’s full service
customers. Electric Customer Choice participants will pay cost-based distribution rates, while
Detroit Edison’s full service commercial and industrial customers will pay cost-based distribution
rates that reflect the cost of the residential rate subsidy. Residential customers continue to pay
a subsidized below cost rate for distribution service. These revenue neutral revised rates were
effective February 1, 2006. Detroit Edison was also ordered to file a general rate case by July 1,
2007, based on 2006 actual results.



Other Postretirement Benefits Costs Tracker

In February 2005, Detroit Edison filed an application, pursuant to the MPSC’s November 2004
final rate order, requesting MPSC approval of a proposed tracking mechanism for retiree health care
costs. This mechanism would recognize differences between cost levels collected in rates and the
actual costs under current accounting rules as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities with an
annual reconciliation proceeding before the MPSC. In February 2006, the MPSC denied Detroit
Edison’s request and ordered that this issue be addressed in the next general rate case due to be
filed by July 1, 2007.

2004 PSCR Reconciliation and 2004 Net Stranded Cost Case

In accordance with the MPSC’s direction in Detroit Edison’s November 2004 rate order, in March
2005, Detroit Edison filed a joint application and testimony in its 2004 PSCR Reconciliation Case
and its 2004 Net Stranded Cost Recovery Case. The combined proceeding will provide a comprehensive
true-up of the 2004 PSCR and production fixed cost stranded cost calculations, including treatment
of Detroit Edison’s third party wholesale sales revenues. Under the MPSC’s preferred methodology,
Detroit Edison incurred approximately $112 million in stranded
costs for 2004. Detroit Edison also
received approximately $218 million in third party wholesale sales.

In the filing, Detroit Edison recommended the following distribution of the $218 million of third
party wholesale sale revenues: $91 million to offset PSCR fuel expense and $74 million to offset
2004 production operation and maintenance expense. The remaining $53 million would be allocated
between bundled customers and electric Customer Choice customers. This allocation would result in
a refund of approximately $8 million to bundled customers and a net stranded cost amount to be
collected from electric Customer Choice customers of approximately $99 million.

Included with the application was the filing of a motion for a temporary interim order requesting
the continuation of the existing electric Customer Choice transition charges until a final order is
issued. The MPSC denied this motion in August 2005. A final order is expected in the first half of
2006.

Electric Industry Restructuring

Electric Rates, Customer Choice and Stranded Costs

— In 2000, the Michigan Legislature
enacted PA 141 that reduced electric retail rates by 5%, as a result of savings derived from the
issuance of securitization bonds. The legislation also contained provisions freezing rates through
2003 and preventing rate increases (i.e., rate caps) for small business customers through 2004 and
for residential customers through 2005. The price freeze period expired on February 20, 2004
pursuant to an MPSC order. In addition, PA 141 codified the MPSC’s existing electric Customer
Choice program and provided Detroit Edison with the right to recover net stranded costs associated
with electric Customer Choice. Detroit Edison was also allowed to defer certain costs to be
recovered once rates could be increased, including costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes,
laws and other governmental actions.

As required by PA 141, the MPSC conducted a proceeding to develop a methodology for calculating net
stranded costs associated with electric Customer Choice. In a December 2001 order, the MPSC
determined that Detroit Edison could
recover net stranded costs associated with the fixed cost component of its electric generation
operations. Specifically, there would be an annual proceeding or true-up before the MPSC
reconciling the receipt of revenues associated with the fixed cost component of its generation
services to the revenue requirement for the fixed cost component of those services, inclusive of an
allowance for the cost of capital. Any resulting shortfall in recovery, net of mitigation, would
be considered a net stranded cost. The MPSC authorized Detroit Edison to establish a regulatory
asset to defer recovery of its incurred stranded costs, subject to review in a subsequent annual
net stranded cost proceeding.

In July 2003, the MPSC issued an order finding that Detroit Edison had no net stranded costs in
2000 and 2001. Detroit Edison filed a petition for rehearing of the July 2003 order, which the
MPSC denied in December 2003. The MPSC’s November 2004 order authorized recovery of $44 million of
historical stranded costs incurred in 2002, 2003 and January and February 2004 collectible from
electric Customer Choice customers through



transition charges. From March 2004 through the first
quarter of 2005, Detroit Edison recorded $112 million of additional stranded costs as a regulatory
asset as the result of rate caps and higher electric Customer Choice sales losses than included in
the 2004 MPSC interim order. In March of 2005, Detroit Edison filed an application for its 2004
stranded cost recovery case. A final order is expected in the first half of 2006.

Securitization

— Detroit Edison formed The Detroit Edison Securitization Funding LLC
(Securitization LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary, for the purpose of securitizing its qualified
costs, primarily related to the unamortized investment in the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant. In March
2001, the Securitization LLC issued $1.75 billion of securitization bonds, and Detroit Edison sold
$1.75 billion of qualified costs to the Securitization LLC. The Securitization LLC is independent
of Detroit Edison, as is its ownership of the qualified costs. Due to principles of consolidation,
the qualified costs and securitization bonds appear on our consolidated statement of financial
position. We make no claim to these assets. Ownership of such assets has vested in the
Securitization LLC and been assigned to the trustee for the securitization bonds. Neither the
qualified costs nor funds from an MPSC approved non-bypassable surcharge collected from Detroit
Edison’s customers for the payment of costs related to the Securitization LLC and securitization
bonds are available to Detroit Edison’s creditors.

DTE2 Accounting

In July 2004, Detroit Edison filed an accounting application with the MPSC requesting
authority to capitalize and amortize DTE2 costs, consisting of computer equipment, software and
development costs, as well as related training, maintenance and overhead costs. In April 2005, the
MPSC approved a settlement agreement providing for the deferral of up to $60 million of certain
DTE2 costs that would otherwise be expensed, as a regulatory asset for future rate recovery
starting January 1, 2006. In addition, DTE2 costs recorded as plant assets will be amortized over a
15-year period.

Power Supply Recovery Proceedings

2005 Plan Year

— In September 2004, Detroit Edison filed its 2005 PSCR plan case seeking
approval of a levelized PSCR factor of 1.82 mills per kWh above the amount included in base rates.
In December 2004, Detroit Edison filed revisions to its 2005 PSCR plan case in accordance with the
November 2004 MPSC rate order. The revised filing seeks approval of a levelized PSCR factor of up
to 0.48 mills per kWh above the new base rates established in the final electric rate order.
Included in the factor are power supply costs, transmission expenses and nitrogen oxide emission
allowance costs. Detroit Edison self-implemented a factor of negative 2.00 mills per kWh on January
1, 2005. Effective June 1, 2005, Detroit Edison began billing the maximum allowable factor of 0.48
mills per kWh due to increased power supply costs. In September 2005, the MPSC approved Detroit
Edison’s 2005 PSCR plan case. At December 31, 2005, Detroit Edison has recorded an under-recovery
of approximately $144 million related to the 2005 plan year.

2006 Plan Year —

In September 2005, Detroit Edison filed its 2006 PSCR plan case seeking approval
of a levelized PSCR factor of 4.99 mills per kWh above the amount included in base rates for
residential customers
and 8.29 per kWh above the amount included in base rates for commercial and industrial customers.
Included in the factor for all customers are power supply costs, transmission expenses, MISO
market participation costs, and nitrogen oxide emission allowance costs. The Company’s PSCR
Plan includes a matrix which provides for different maximum PSCR factors contingent on varying
electric Customer Choice sales levels. The plan also includes $97 million for recovery of its
projected 2005 PSCR under-collection associated with commercial and industrial customers.
Additionally, the PSCR plan requests MPSC approval of expense associated with sulfur dioxide
emission allowances, mercury emission allowances, and fuel additives. In conjunction with DTE
Energy’s sale of the transmission assets of ITC in February 2003, the FERC froze ITC’s transmission
rates through December 2004. In approving the sale, FERC authorized ITC recovery of the difference
between the revenue it would have collected and the actual revenue ITC did collect during the rate
freeze period. At December 31, 2005 this amount is estimated to be $66 million which is to be
included in ITC’s rates over a five-year period beginning June 1, 2006. It is expected that this
amortization will increase Detroit Edison’s transmission expense in 2006 by $7 million. As
previously discussed, Detroit Edison received rate orders in 2004 that allow for the recovery of
transmission expenses through the PSCR mechanism.



In December 2005, the MPSC issued a temporary order authorizing the Company to begin implementation
of maximum quarterly PSCR factors on January 1, 2006. The quarterly factors reflect a downward
adjustment in the Company’s total power supply costs of approximately 2% to reflect the potential
variability in cost projections. The quarterly factors will allow the Company to more closely
track the costs of providing electric service to our customers and, because the non-summer factors
are well below those ordered for the summer months, effectively delay the higher power supply costs
to the summer months at which time our customers will not be experiencing large expenditures for
home heating. The MPSC did not adopt the Company’s request to recover its projected 2005 PSCR
under-collection associated with commercial and industrial customers nor did it adopt the Company’s
request to implement contingency factors based upon the Company’s increased costs associated with
providing electric service to returning electric Customer Choice customers. The MPSC deferred both
of those Company proposals to the final order on the Company’s entire 2006 PSCR Plan.

Administrative and General Expenses Report to the MPSC

In October 2005, the MPSC ordered Detroit Edison to file a report on why its administrative
and general expenses appear to be higher than levels incurred by Consumers Energy, Michigan’s other
major electric utility. On February 1, 2006, a report was filed that explained Detroit Edison’s
administrative and general expense differences, as well as its overall cost and rate
competitiveness.

Emergency Rules for Electric and Gas Bills

In October 2005, the MPSC established emergency billing practices in effect for electric and
gas services rendered November 1, 2005 through March 31, 2006. These emergency rules apply to
retail electric and gas customers. The rule changes:

Transmission Proceedings

In November 2004, a FERC order approved a transmission pricing structure to facilitate
seamless trading of electricity between MISO and the PJM Interconnection. The pricing structure
eliminates layers of transmission charges between the two regional transmission organizations. The
FERC noted that the new pricing structure may result in transmission owners facing abrupt revenue
shifts. To facilitate the transition to the new pricing structure, the FERC authorized a Seams
Elimination Cost Adjustment (SECA), effective from December 2004 through March 2006. Under MISO’s
filing with the FERC, Detroit Edison’s SECA obligation was approximately $2 million per month from
December 2004 through March 2005 and approximately $1 million per month from April 2005 through
March 2006. In December 2004, Detroit Edison filed a request for rehearing with the FERC which
states, among other things, that SECA is retroactive ratemaking and is unlawful under the Federal
Power Act. FERC has not ruled on Detroit Edison’s request for rehearing. However in February 2005,
FERC ordered hearings to review the proposed SECA charges. The charges are being collected subject
to refund. Hearings on this matter are scheduled to conclude in late 2006. Under the MPSC’s
November 2004 final rate order, transmission expenses are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism.
Therefore, SECA charges, if ultimately imposed, should not have a financial impact to Detroit
Edison.



Gas Rate Case

On April 28, 2005, the MPSC issued an order for final rate relief. The MPSC determined that
the base rate increase granted to MichCon should be $61 million annually effective April 29, 2005.
This amount is an increase of $26 million over the $35 million in interim rate relief approved in
September 2004. The rate increase was based on a 50% debt and 50% equity capital structure and an
11% rate of return on common equity.

The MPSC adopted MichCon’s proposed tracking mechanism for uncollectible accounts receivable. Each
year, MichCon will file an application comparing its actual uncollectible expense to its designated
revenue recovery of approximately $37 million. Ninety percent of the difference will be refunded or
surcharged after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the MPSC. The MPSC also approved the
deferral of the non-capitalized portion of the negative pension expense. MichCon will record a
regulatory liability for any negative pension costs as determined under generally accepted
accounting principles. Included as part of the base rate increase, the order provided for $25
million in rates to recover safety and training costs. There is a one-way tracking mechanism that
provides for refunding the portion of the $25 million not expended on an annual basis.

The MPSC order reduced MichCon’s depreciation rates, and the related revenue requirement associated
with depreciation expense by $14.5 million and is designed to have no impact on net income.

The MPSC did not allow the recovery of approximately $25 million of merger interest costs allocated
to MichCon that were incurred by DTE Energy as a result of the acquisition of MCN Energy.

The MPSC order also resulted in the disallowance of computer system and equipment costs and
adjustments to environmental regulatory assets and liabilities. The MPSC disallowed recovery of
ninety percent of the costs of a computer billing system that was in place prior to DTE Energy’s
acquisition of MCN Energy in 2001. As a result of the order, MichCon recognized an impairment of
this asset of approximately $42 million in the first quarter of 2005. This impairment had a minimal
impact on DTE Energy because a valuation allowance was established for this asset at the time of
the MCN acquisition in 2001. The MPSC disallowed approximately $6 million of certain computer
equipment and related depreciation and the recovery of certain internal labor and legal costs
related to remediation of MGP sites of approximately $6 million. The MPSC ordered an additional $5
million charge due to a change in the allocation of historical MGP sites insurance proceeds.

Gas Industry Restructuring

In December 2001, the MPSC approved MichCon’s application for a voluntary, expanded permanent
gas Customer Choice program, which replaced the experimental program that expired in March 2002.
The number of customers eligible to participate in the gas Customer Choice program increased over a
three-year period. Effective April 2004, all of MichCon’s approximately 1.3 million customers
could elect to participate in the Customer Choice program, thereby purchasing their gas from
suppliers other than MichCon. The MPSC also approved the use of deferred accounting for the
recovery of implementation costs of the gas Customer Choice program.

Gas Cost Recovery Proceedings

2002 Plan Year

- In December 2001, the MPSC issued an order that permitted MichCon to
implement GCR factors up to $3.62 per Mcf for January 2002 billings and up to $4.38 per Mcf for the
remainder of 2002. The order also allowed MichCon to recognize a regulatory asset representing the
difference between the $4.38 factor and the $3.62 factor for volumes that were unbilled at December
31, 2001. The regulatory asset was subject to the 2002 GCR reconciliation process. In March 2003,
the MPSC issued an order in MichCon’s 2002 GCR plan case. MichCon’s decision during 2001 to utilize
storage gas resulted in a gas inventory decrement for the 2001 calendar year. For this reason, the
MPSC ordered MichCon to reduce its gas cost recovery expenses by $26.5 million for purposes of
calculating the 2002 GCR factor. We recorded a $26.5 million reserve in 2003 to reflect the impact
of this order.



MichCon’s 2002 GCR reconciliation case was filed with the MPSC in February 2003. The Staff and
various intervening parties in this proceeding sought to have the MPSC disallow an additional $26
million, representing unbilled revenues at December 2001. One party also proposed the disallowance
of half of an $8 million payment made to settle Enron bankruptcy issues. The other parties to the
case recommended that the Enron bankruptcy settlement be addressed in the 2003 GCR reconciliation
case. In April 2005, the MPSC issued an order in the 2002 GCR reconciliation case affirming the
order in the 2002 GCR plan case disallowing $26.5 million related to the use of storage gas in
2001. The April 2005 order also disallowed the additional $26 million representing unbilled
revenues at December 2001. We recorded the impact of the disallowance in the first quarter of 2005.
The MPSC agreed that the $8 million related to the Enron issue be addressed in the 2003 GCR
reconciliation case.

2003 Plan Year

- MichCon’s 2003 GCR reconciliation case was filed with the MPSC in February 2004.
In May 2005, the MPSC issued an order in the 2003 GCR reconciliation case approving recovery of the
$8 million related to the Enron bankruptcy settlement.

2004 Plan Year —

In September 2003, MichCon filed its 2004 GCR plan case proposing a maximum GCR
factor of $5.36 per Mcf. MichCon agreed to switch from a calendar year to an operational year as a
condition of its settlement in the 2003 GCR plan case. The operational GCR year runs from April to
March of the following year. To accomplish the switch, the 2004 GCR plan reflected a 15-month
transitional period, January 2004 through March 2005. Under this transition proposal, MichCon filed
two reconciliations pertaining to the transition period; one in June 2004 addressing January
through March 2004, one filed in June 2005 addressing the remaining April 2004 through March 2005
period and consolidating the two for purposes of the case. The June 2005 filing supported the $46
million under-recovery with interest MichCon had accrued for the period ending March 31, 2005.
MichCon does not expect a final order before the third quarter of 2006.

2005-2006 Plan Year —

In December 2004, MichCon filed its 2005-2006 GCR plan case proposing a
maximum GCR factor of $7.99 per Mcf. The plan includes quarterly contingent GCR factors. These
contingent factors allow MichCon to increase the maximum GCR factor to compensate for increases in
gas market prices, thereby reducing the possibility of a GCR under-recovery. In April 2005, the
MPSC issued an order recognizing that Michigan law allows MichCon to self-implement its quarterly
contingent factors. MichCon self-implemented quarterly contingent GCR factors of $8.54 per Mcf in
July 2005 and $10.09 per Mcf in October 2005.

In
response to market price increases in the fall of 2005, MichCon filed a
petition to reopen the record in the case during September 2005. MichCon proposed a revised maximum GCR factor of $13.10
per Mcf and a revised contingent factor matrix. In its order issued October 6, 2005, the MPSC
reopened the record in the case. On October 28, 2005, the MPSC approved an increase in the GCR
factor to a cap of $11.3851 per Mcf for the period November 2005 through March 2006.

2006-2007 Plan Year

— In December 2005, MichCon filed its 2006-2007 GCR plan case proposing a
maximum GCR Factor of $12.15 per Mcf. The plan includes quarterly contingent GCR factors. These
contingent factors allow MichCon to increase the maximum GCR factor to compensate for increases in
market prices, thereby reducing the possibility of a GCR under-recovery.

Minimum Pension Liability

In December 2002, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability as required under SFAS
No. 87, with offsetting amounts to an intangible asset and other comprehensive income. During
2003, the MPSC Staff provided an opinion that the MPSC’s traditional rate setting process allowed
for the recovery of pension costs as measured by SFAS No. 87. Based on the MPSC Staff opinion,
management believes that it will be allowed to recover in rates the minimum pension liability
associated with its utility operations and as such the amount was
reclassified to a regulatory asset. At December 31, 2005 and
2004, we have recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $544 million
($354 million net of tax) and $605 million ($393 million net of tax), respectively. See
Note 14.



Other

We are unable to predict the outcome of the regulatory matters discussed herein. Resolution
of these matters is dependent upon future MPSC orders and appeals, which may materially impact the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.

NOTE 5 — NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

General

Fermi 2, our nuclear generating plant, began commercial operation in 1988. Fermi 2 has a
design electrical rating (net) of 1,150 megawatts. This plant represents approximately 10% of
Detroit Edison’s summer net rated capability. The net book balance of the Fermi 2 plant was
written off at December 31, 1998, and an equivalent regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the
Fermi 2 regulatory asset was securitized. See Note 4. Detroit Edison also owns Fermi 1, a nuclear
plant that was shut down in 1972 and is currently being decommissioned. The NRC has jurisdiction
over the licensing and operation of Fermi 2 and the decommissioning of Fermi 1.

Property Insurance

Detroit Edison maintains several different types of property insurance policies specifically
for the Fermi 2 plant. These policies cover such items as replacement power and property damage.
The Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) is the primary supplier of the insurance polices.

Detroit Edison maintains a policy for extra expenses, including replacement power costs
necessitated by Fermi 2’s unavailability due to an insured event. These policies have a 12-week
waiting period and provide an aggregate $490 million of coverage over a three-year period.

Detroit Edison has $500 million in primary coverage and $2.25 billion of excess coverage for
stabilization, decontamination, debris removal, repair and/or replacement of property and
decommissioning. The combined coverage limit for total property damage is $2.75 billion.

For multiple terrorism losses caused by acts of terrorism not covered under the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (TRIA) occurring within one year after the first loss from
terrorism, the NEIL policies would make available to all insured entities up to $3.2 billion, plus
any amounts recovered from reinsurance, government indemnity, or other sources to cover losses.

Under the NEIL policies, Detroit Edison could be liable for maximum assessments of up to
approximately $30 million per event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear plant
in the United States should exceed the accumulated funds available to NEIL.

Public Liability Insurance

As required by federal law, Detroit Edison maintains $300 million of public liability
insurance for a nuclear incident. For liabilities arising from a terrorist act outside the scope
of TRIA, the policy is subject to one industry aggregate limit of $300 million. Further, under the
Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005, deferred premium charges up to $101 million could be levied
against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $15 million per year per facility. Thus,
deferred premium charges could be levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the
event of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities.

Decommissioning

Detroit Edison has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power plants following the
expiration of their operating licenses. This obligation is reflected as an asset retirement
obligation, which is classified as a noncurrent regulatory liability. Based on the actual or
anticipated extended life of the nuclear plant,



decommissioning
expenditures for Fermi 2 are expected to be incurred primarily during the period 2025
through 2041. It is estimated that the cost of decommissioning Fermi
2, when its license expires in 2025, will
be $1.1 billion in 2005 dollars and $3.4 billion in 2025
dollars, using a 6% inflation rate. In 2001, Detroit
Edison began the decommissioning of Fermi 1, with the goal of
removing the radioactive material and
terminating the Fermi 1 license. The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is expected to be complete by 2010.

Detroit Edison currently recovers funds for decommissioning and the disposal of low-level
radioactive waste through a revenue surcharge. The amounts recovered from customers are deposited
in the restricted external trust accounts to fund decommissioning.

At December 31, 2005, investments in the external trust consisted of approximately 49% in
publicly traded equity securities, 44% in fixed debt instruments and 7% in cash equivalents.

The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and requires
decommissioning funding based upon a formula. The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of
decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of external trust funds to finance
the decommissioning of Fermi 2. Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of
decommissioning costs of Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is continuing to fund FERC jurisdictional amounts
for decommissioning even though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates. We believe the
MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning using the
NRC formula. The decommissioning assets, anticipated earnings thereon and future revenues from
decommissioning collections will be used to decommission the nuclear facilities. We expect the
regulatory liabilities to be reduced to zero at the conclusion of the decommissioning activities.
If amounts remain in the trust funds for these units following the completion of the
decommissioning activities, those amounts will be returned to the ratepayers.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Detroit Edison has a contract
with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel
from Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is obligated to pay the DOE a fee of 1 mill per kWh of Fermi 2
electricity generated and sold. The fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense. Delays have
occurred in the DOE’s program for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent
repository. Until the DOE is able to fulfill its obligation under the contract, Detroit Edison is
responsible for the spent nuclear fuel storage. Detroit Edison estimates that existing storage
capacity will be sufficient until 2007. We plan expansion of our spent fuel storage capacity that
will meet our requirements through 2010. Detroit Edison is a party in the litigation against the
DOE for



both past and future costs associated with the DOE’s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the
timetable set forth in the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.

NOTE 6 — JOINTLY OWNED UTILITY PLANT

Production tax credits are provided for qualified fuels produced and sold by a taxpayer to an
unrelated party during the taxable year. Production tax credits earned but not utilized totaled
$484 million and are carried forward indefinitely as alternative minimum tax credits. The majority
of the production tax credits earned, including all of those from our synfuel projects, were
generated from projects that have received a private letter ruling (PLR) from the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS). These PLRs provide assurance as to the appropriateness of using these credits to
offset taxable income, however, these tax credits are subject to IRS audit and adjustment.

We have a net operating loss carry-forward of $160 million that expires in years 2019 through 2020.
We do not believe that a valuation allowance is required, as we expect to utilize the loss
carry-forward prior to its expiration.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts in the
financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent
according to the classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities not related to assets or liabilities are classified according to the expected reversal
date of the temporary differences.

During 2005, the IRS completed and closed its audits of our federal income tax returns for the
years 1998 through 2001. The IRS is currently conducting audits of our federal income tax returns
for the years 2002 and 2003. The Company accrues tax and interest related to tax uncertainties
that arise due to actual or potential disagreements with governmental agencies about the tax
treatment of specific items. At December 31, 2005, the Company had accrued approximately $38
million for such uncertainties. We believe that our accrued tax liabilities are adequate for all
years.



NOTE 8 — COMMON STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

Common Stock

In August 2005, we successfully remarketed the senior notes comprising part of our Equity
Security Units that were issued in June 2002. We also settled the stock purchase contract
component of the Equity Security Units by issuing 3.7 million shares of common stock to holders of
these units in August 2005 at an issue price of $46.79. The issue price was calculated by using the
average closing price per share of our common stock during a 20 trading-day period ending August
11, 2005.

In March 2004, we issued 4,344,492 shares of DTE Energy common stock, valued at $170 million. The
common stock was contributed to a defined benefit retirement plan.

Under the DTE Energy Company Long-Term Incentive Plan, we grant non-vested stock awards to key
employees, primarily management. At the time of grant, we record the fair value of the non-vested
awards as unearned compensation, which is reflected as a reduction in common stock. The number of
non-vested stock awards is included in the number of common shares outstanding; however, for
purposes of computing basic earnings per share, non-vested stock awards are excluded.

Shareholders’ Rights Agreement

We have a Shareholders’ Rights Agreement designed to maximize shareholder value should DTE
Energy be acquired. Under certain triggering events, each right entitles the holder to purchase
from DTE Energy one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of
DTE Energy at a price of $90, subject to adjustment as provided for in the Shareholders’ Rights
Agreement. The rights expire in October 2007.

Earnings per Share

We report both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes the issuance of potentially
dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and the repurchase of common shares that would
have occurred with proceeds from the assumed issuance. Diluted earnings per share assume the
exercise of stock options, vesting of non-vested stock awards, and the issuance of performance
share awards. A reconciliation of both calculations is presented in the following table:

Options to purchase approximately two million shares of common stock in 2005, one million
shares in 2004 and five million shares in 2003 were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of
the common shares, thus making these options anti-dilutive.

Remarketable Securities

At December 31, 2004, $175 million of notes of Detroit Edison and MichCon were subject to
periodic remarketings. The $100 million scheduled to remarket in February 2005 was optionally
redeemed by Detroit Edison, and we do not expect any remarketings to take place in 2006. We
direct the remarketing agents to remarket these securities at the lowest interest rate necessary to
produce a par bid. In the event that a remarketing fails, we would be required to purchase the
securities.

Quarterly Income Debt Securities (QUIDS)

Detroit Edison had three series of QUIDS outstanding at December 31, 2004. Detroit Edison
redeemed all of its outstanding QUIDS on March 4, 2005.

Equity-Linked Securities

In June 2002, DTE Energy issued $173 million of 8.75% Equity Security Units, with each unit
consisting of a stock purchase contract and a senior note of DTE Energy. In August 2005, DTE
Energy successfully remarketed $172 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.63% Senior Notes
due August 16, 2007 that were originally issued as a component of the 8.75% Equity Security Units.
Additionally, in August 2005, DTE Energy settled the stock purchase contract component of its
Equity Security Units by issuing common stock



to holders of these units. The issue price determined by the average closing price per share
of our common stock during a 20 trading-day period ending August 11, 2005 was $46.79 per share.
Settlement of the purchase contracts resulted in DTE Energy issuing approximately 3.7 million
shares of common stock in exchange for approximately $172 million.

Trust Preferred-Linked Securities

DTE Energy has interests in various unconsolidated trusts that were formed for the sole
purpose of issuing preferred securities and lending the gross proceeds to us. The sole assets of
the trusts are debt securities of DTE Energy with terms similar to those of the related preferred
securities. Payments we make are used by the trusts to make cash distributions on the preferred
securities it has issued.

We have the right to extend interest payment periods on the debt securities. Should we exercise
this right, we cannot declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or acquire, any of our
capital stock during the deferral period.

DTE Energy has issued certain guarantees with respect to payments on the preferred securities.
These guarantees, when taken together with our obligations under the debt securities and related
indenture, provide full and unconditional guarantees of the trusts’ obligations under the preferred
securities.

Financing costs for these issuances were paid for and deferred by DTE Energy. These costs are
being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the related securities.

Cross Default Provisions

Substantially all of the net utility properties of Detroit Edison and MichCon are subject to
the lien of mortgages. Should Detroit Edison or MichCon fail to timely pay their indebtedness
under these mortgages, such failure may create cross defaults in the indebtedness of DTE Energy.

NOTE 10 — SHORT-TERM CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS

DTE Energy and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Detroit Edison and MichCon, have entered into
revolving credit facilities with similar terms. The five-year credit facilities are with a
syndicate of banks and may be used for general corporate borrowings, but are intended to provide
liquidity support for each of the Companies’ commercial paper programs.

In October 2005, DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon entered into new five-year revolving credit
agreements with an aggregate capacity of $925 million. Simultaneously, we amended our existing $975



million, five-year revolving credit facilities to provide for the substitution of some of the
participating lenders, as well as modifications to pricing, conditions to borrowing, covenants,
events of default and other miscellaneous provisions to conform to the terms of the new agreements.
The aggregate availability under these combined facilities is $1.9 billion as shown in the

Borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing short-term interest rates. The
agreements require each of the companies to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of no
more than .65 to l. Should either Detroit Edison or MichCon have delinquent debt obligations of at
least $50 million to any creditor, such delinquency will be considered a default under DTE Energy’s
credit agreements. DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon are currently in compliance with these
financial covenants. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding commercial paper of $841 million.
In addition, we had approximately $284 million of letters of credit outstanding against these
facilities at December 31, 2005.

In December 2005, DTE Energy entered into a new $150 million letter of credit and reimbursement
agreement. The reimbursement agreement has a one-year term with a variable interest rate.
Provisions for an automatic one-year extension and conversion to a two-year term loan are available
as long as certain conditions are met. We had approximately $80 million of letters of credit
outstanding against this agreement at December 31, 2005.

In conjunction with maintaining certain exchange traded risk management positions, we may be
required to post cash collateral with our clearing agent. We have entered into a Margin Loan
Facility (Facility) with an affiliate of the clearing agent of up to $103 million as of December
31, 2005. We entered into this facility in lieu of posting cash. This facility was backed by a
letter of credit issued by DTE Energy in the amount of $100 million. Any margin requirement in
excess of the Facility is funded in cash by DTE Energy. The amount outstanding under the Facility
is subject to an interest rate at a per annum rate of interest equal to the LIBOR rate, plus 0.75%,
calculated daily. The amount outstanding under the Facility was $103 million and $23 million as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Detroit Edison has a $200 million short-term financing agreement secured by customer accounts
receivable. This agreement contains certain covenants related to the delinquency of accounts
receivable. Detroit Edison is currently in compliance with these covenants. We had no balances
outstanding under this financing agreement at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The weighted average interest rates for short-term borrowings were 4.4% and 2.4% at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Accounting for changes in fair value depends on the purpose of the
derivative instrument and whether it is designated as a hedge and
qualifies for hedge accounting.

•

Special accounting is allowed for a derivative instrument
qualifying as a hedge and designated as a hedge for the
variability of cash flow associated with a forecasted transaction.
Gain or loss associated with the



effective portion of the hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income. The ineffective
portion is recorded to earnings. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be
reclassified to net income when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If a cash flow
hedge is discontinued because it is likely the forecasted transaction will not occur, net gains
or losses are immediately recorded to earnings.

•

Special accounting is allowed for derivative instruments that qualifying as a hedge and
designated as a hedge of the changes in fair value of an existing asset, liability or firm
commitment. Gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded into earnings. An offsetting
loss or gain on the underlying asset, liability or firm commitment is also recorded to
earnings.

Our primary market risk exposure is associated with commodity prices, credit, interest rates and
foreign currency. We have risk management policies to monitor and decrease market risks. We use
derivative instruments to manage some of the exposure. Except for the activities of the Fuel
Transportation and Marketing segment, we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading
purposes. The fair value of all derivatives is shown as “assets or liabilities from risk management
and trading activities” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Commodity Price Risk

Utility Operations

Detroit Edison

– Detroit Edison generates, purchases, distributes and sells electricity. Detroit
Edison uses forward energy, capacity, and futures contracts to manage changes in the price of
electricity and fuel. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges or meet the
normal purchases and sales exemption and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.
There were no commodity price risk cash flow hedges for utility operations at December 31, 2005.

MichCon

– MichCon purchases, stores, transmits and distributes and sells natural gas. MichCon
has fixed-priced contracts for portions of its expected gas supply requirements through 2008. These
gas supply and firm transportation contracts are designated and qualify for the normal purchases
and sales exemption and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.

Commodity price risk associated with our utilities is limited due to the PSCR and GCR mechanisms.
See Note 1.

Non-Utility Operations

Fuel Transportation and Marketing –

DTE Energy Trading markets and trades wholesale electricity and
natural gas physical products, trades financial instruments, and provides risk management services
utilizing energy commodity derivative instruments. Forwards, futures, options and swap agreements
are used to manage exposure to the risk of market price and volume fluctuations on its operations.
These derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings, usually as
adjustments to operating revenues or fuel, purchased power and gas expense. This fair value
accounting better aligns financial reporting with the way the business is managed and its
performance measured.

Fuel Transportation and Marketing experiences earnings volatility as a result of its gas inventory
and other non-derivative assets that do not qualify for fair value accounting under accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. Although the risks associated with these asset positions
are substantially offset, requirements to fair value the underlying derivatives result in
unrealized gains and losses being recorded to earnings that eventually reverse upon settlement.

Power and Industrial Projects –

The Coal-Based Fuels and Landfill Gas Recovery businesses generate
production tax credits. We have sold interests in all nine of our synthetic fuel production plants.
Proceeds from the sales are contingent upon production levels, the production qualifying for
production tax credits, and the value of such credits. Production tax credits are subject to phase
out if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels. See Note 13.



To manage our exposure in 2006 and 2007 to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce
or eliminate synfuel sales proceeds, we entered into a series of derivative contracts covering a
specified number of barrels of oil. The derivative contracts involve purchased and written call
options that provide for net cash settlement at expiration based on the full years’ 2006 and 2007
average New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) trading prices for light, sweet crude oil in relation
to the strike prices of each option. If the average NYMEX prices of oil in 2006 and 2007 are less
than approximately $58, and $60, per barrel, respectively, the derivatives will yield no payment.
If the average NYMEX prices of oil exceed approximately $58, and $60, per barrel, respectively, the
derivatives will yield a payment equal to the excess of the average NYMEX price over these initial
strike prices, multiplied by the number of barrels covered, up to a maximum price of approximately
$73, and $71 per barrel, respectively. The agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Consequently, changes in the fair value of the options are recorded currently in earnings. For all
synfuel hedge contracts, including 2005 hedges, we recorded total pretax mark to market gains of
$48 million in 2005. The fair value changes are recorded as adjustments to the gain from selling
interests in synfuel facilities and therefore included in the “Asset gains and losses, net” line
item in the consolidated statement of operations.

Unconventional Gas Production

– Our Unconventional Gas business is engaged in natural gas
exploration, development and production. We use derivative contracts to manage changes in the
price of natural gas. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and are primarily legacy
transactions. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to earnings as the
related production affects earnings through 2013. In 2005, $35 million of after-tax losses were
reclassified to earnings.

Credit Risk

Our utility and non-utility businesses are exposed to credit risk if customers or
counterparties do not comply with their contractual obligations. We maintain credit policies that
significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential
customers’ and counterparties’ financial condition, credit rating, collateral requirements or other
credit enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees. We generally use standardized
agreements that allow the netting of positive and negative transactions associated with a single
counterparty.

Interest Rate Risk

We use interest rate swaps, treasury locks and other derivatives to hedge the risk associated
with interest rate market volatility. In 2004 and 2000, we entered into a series of interest rate
derivatives to limit our sensitivity to market interest rate risk associated with the issuance of
long-term debt. Such instruments were designated as cash flow hedges. We subsequently issued
long-term debt and terminated these hedges at a cost that is included in other comprehensive loss.
Amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to interest expense as the
related interest affects earnings through 2030. In 2006, we estimate
reclassifying $4 million of
losses to earnings.

Foreign Currency Risk

DTE Energy Trading has foreign currency forward contracts to hedge fixed Canadian dollar
commitments existing under power purchase and sale contracts and gas transportation contracts. We
entered into these contracts to mitigate any price volatility with respect to fluctuations of the
Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Certain of these contracts were designated as cash
flow hedges with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income. Amounts recorded to
other comprehensive income are classified to operating revenues or fuel, purchased power and gas
expense when the related hedged item affects earnings.

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments is determined by using various market data and other
valuation techniques. The table below shows the fair value relative to the carrying value for
long-term debt securities. The carrying value of certain other financial instruments, such as
notes payable, customer deposits and notes receivable approximate fair value and are not shown.

NOTE 13 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Synthetic Fuel Operations

We partially own nine synthetic fuel production facilities. Synfuel facilities chemically
change coal, including waste and marginal coal, into a synthetic fuel as determined under
applicable Internal Revenue Service rules. Production tax credits are provided for the production
and sale of solid synthetic fuels produced from coal. To qualify for the production tax credits,
the synthetic fuel must meet three primary conditions: (1) there must be a significant chemical
change in the coal feedstock, (2) the product must be sold to an unaffiliated entity, and (3) the
production facility must have been placed in service before July 1, 1998. In addition to meeting
the qualifying conditions for years through 2005, a taxpayer must have sufficient taxable income to
earn the production tax credits.

To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax
credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels from alternative sources. This incentive is
not deemed necessary if the price of oil increases and provides a natural market for these fuels.
As such, the tax credit in a given year is reduced if the Reference Price of oil within that year
exceeds a threshold price. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual
average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil. During 2005 the monthly average wellhead
price per barrel of oil for the year was approximately $6 lower than the NYMEX price for light,
sweet crude oil. The threshold price at which the credit begins to be reduced was set in 1980 and
is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2006, we estimate the threshold price at which the tax
credit would begin to be reduced is $53 per barrel and would be completely phased out if the
Reference Price reached $67 per barrel. As of February 28, 2006, the realized and unrealized NYMEX
daily closing price of a barrel of oil was $65.08, equating to an estimated Reference Price of $59,
which is within the phase-out range. We cannot predict with any accuracy the future price of a
barrel of oil. If, however, the Reference Price remained at this level throughout the remainder of
2006, we would experience a partial phase out of production tax credits.

Numerous events have increased domestic crude oil prices, including terrorism, storm-related supply
disruptions and worldwide demand. If the credit is reduced or eliminated in future years, our
financial statements may be negatively impacted. We continue to evaluate the current volatility in
oil prices and alternatives available to mitigate our exposure to oil prices. To manage our
exposure to oil prices in 2006 and 2007, we entered into oil-related derivative contracts for a
portion of our exposure. See Note 12.

Through December 31, 2005 we have generated and recorded approximately $557 million in synfuel tax
credits.

Environmental

Electric Utility

Air

- Detroit Edison is subject to EPA ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit
power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In March 2005, EPA issued additional
emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze and mercury air
pollution. The new rules will lead to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. To comply with these requirements, Detroit
Edison has spent approximately $644 million through 2005. We estimate Detroit Edison future capital
expenditures at up to $218 million in 2006 and up to $2.2 billion of additional capital
expenditures through 2018 to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control requirements. Under
the June 2000 Michigan restructuring legislation, beginning January 1, 2004, annual



return of and on this capital expenditure could be deferred in ratemaking, until December 31, 2005,
the expiration of the rate cap period.

Water

- Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts
of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. Based on the results of the
studies to be conducted over the next several years, Detroit Edison may be required to install
additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the intakes. It is estimated that we will
incur up to $50 million over the next four to six years in additional capital expenditures for
Detroit Edison.

Contaminated Sites

- Detroit Edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites,
including two former MGP sites, the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and
aboveground storage tank locations. The findings of these investigations indicated that the
estimated cost to remediate these sites is approximately $13 million which was accrued in 2005 and
is expected to be incurred over the next several years.

Gas Utility

Contaminated Sites

- Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas
for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil.
Gas Utility owns, or previously owned, 15 such former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites.
Investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each
site. In addition to the MGP sites, we are also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated
sites. Cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several
years.

In 1993, a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism was approved by the MPSC for investigation and
remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites in excess of this reserve. Gas Utility employed
outside consultants to evaluate remediation alternatives for these sites, to assist in estimating
its potential liabilities and to review its archived insurance policies. As a result of these
studies, Gas Utility accrued an additional liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of $35
million during 1995. During 2005, we spent approximately $4 million investigating and remediating
these former MGP sites. In December 2005, we retained multiple environmental consultants to
estimate the projected cost to remediate each MGP site. We accrued an additional $9 million in
remediation liabilities associated with two of our MGP sites, to increase the reserve balance to
$35 million at December 31, 2005.

Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of
contamination and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for
the sites and affect the Company’s financial position and cash flows. However, we anticipate the
cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the MPSC will prevent environmental costs
from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Other

Our non-utility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing
with the protection of the environment from various pollutants. We are in the process of installing
new environmental equipment at our coke battery facilities in Michigan. We expect the projects to
be completed within two years at a cost of approximately $25 million. Our other non-utility
affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements.

Guarantees

In certain circumstances we enter into contractual guarantees. We may guarantee another
entity’s obligation in the event it fails to perform. We may provide guarantees in certain
indemnification agreements. Finally, we may provide indirect guarantees for the indebtedness of
others. Below are the details of specific material guarantees we currently provide. Our other
guarantees are not individually material and total approximately $36 million at December 31, 2005.



Sale of Interests in Synfuel Facilities

We have provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in
our synfuel facilities. The guarantees cover general commercial, environmental, oil price and
tax-related exposure and will survive until 90 days after expiration of all applicable statute of
limitations, or indefinitely, depending on the nature of the guarantee. We estimate that our
maximum liability under these guarantees at December 31, 2005 is $1.8 billion.

Parent Company Guarantee of Subsidiary Obligations

We have issued guarantees for the benefit of various non-utility subsidiary transactions. In the
event that DTE Energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade, certain of these
guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately $536 million
at December 31, 2005. This estimated amount fluctuates based upon commodity prices (primarily
power and gas) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying agreements.

Personal Property Taxes

Detroit Edison, MichCon and other Michigan utilities have asserted that Michigan’s valuation
tables result in the substantial overvaluation of utility personal property. Valuation tables
established by the Michigan State Tax Commission (STC) are used to determine the taxable value of
personal property based on the property’s age. In November 1999, the STC approved new valuation
tables that more accurately recognize the value of a utility’s personal property. The new tables
became effective in 2000 and are currently used to calculate property tax expense. However,
several local taxing jurisdictions have taken legal action attempting to prevent the STC from
implementing the new valuation tables and have continued to prepare assessments based on the
superseded tables. The legal actions regarding the appropriateness of the new tables were before
the Michigan Tax Tribunal (MTT) which, in April 2002, issued a decision essentially affirming the
validity of the STC’s new tables. In June 2002, petitioners in the case filed an appeal of the
MTT’s decision with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In January 2004, the Michigan Court of Appeals
upheld the validity of the new tables. With no further appeal by the petitioners available, the MTT
began to schedule utility personal property valuation cases for Prehearing General Calls. After a
period of abeyance the MTT issued a scheduling order in a significant number of Detroit Edison and
MichCon appeals that set litigation calendars for these cases extending into mid-2006. After an
extended period of settlement discussions, a Memorandum of Understanding has been reached with six
principals in the litigation and the Michigan Department of Treasury that is expected to lead to
settlement of all outstanding property tax disputes on a global basis.

On December 8, 2005 executed Stipulations for Consent Judgment, Consent Judgments, and Schedules to
Consent Judgment were filed with the MTT on behalf of Detroit Edison, MichCon and a significant
number of the largest jurisdictions, in terms of tax dollars, involved in the litigation. The
filing of these documents fulfilled the requirements of the global settlement agreement and
resolves a number of claims by the litigants against each other including both property and
non-property issues. The global settlement agreement results in an pre-tax economic benefit to DTE
Energy of $43 million that includes the release of a litigation reserve.

Other Commitments

Detroit Edison has an Energy Purchase Agreement to purchase steam and electricity from the
Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Authority (GDRRA). Under the Agreement, Detroit Edison will
purchase steam through 2008 and electricity through June 2024. In 1996, a special charge to income
was recorded that included a reserve for steam purchase commitments in excess of replacement costs
from 1997 through 2008. The reserve for steam purchase commitments is being amortized to fuel,
purchased power and gas expense with non-cash accretion expense being recorded through 2008. We
purchased $42 million of steam and electricity in 2005 and 2004 and $39 million in 2003. We
estimate steam and electric purchase commitments through 2024 will not exceed $427 million. As
discussed in Note 3, in January 2003, we sold the steam heating business of Detroit Edison to
Thermal Ventures II, LP. Due to terms of the sale, Detroit Edison remains contractually obligated
to buy steam from GDRRA until 2008 and recorded an additional liability of $20



million for future commitments. Also, we have guaranteed bank loans that Thermal Ventures II, LP
may use for capital improvements to the steam heating system.

In 2004, we modified our future purchase commitments under a transportation agreement with an
interstate pipeline company and terminated a related long-term gas exchange (storage) agreement.
Under the gas exchange agreement, we received gas from the customer during the summer injection
period and redelivered the gas during the winter heating season. The agreements were at rates that
were not reflective of current market conditions and had been fair valued under accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. In 2002, the fair value of the transportation agreement
was frozen when it no longer met the definition of a derivative as a result of FERC Order 637. The
fair value amounts were being amortized to income over the life of the related agreements,
representing a net liability of approximately $75 million as of December 31, 2003. As a result of
the contract modification and termination, we recorded an adjustment to the net liability
increasing 2004 earnings by $48 million, net of taxes.

As of December 31, 2005, we were party to numerous long-term purchase commitments relating to a
variety of goods and services required for our business. These agreements primarily consist of
fuel supply commitments and energy trading contracts. We estimate that these commitments will be
approximately $6.7 billion through 2051. We also estimate that 2006 base level capital expenditures
will be $1.2 billion. We have made certain commitments in connection with expected capital
expenditures.

Bankruptcies

We purchase and sell electricity, gas, coal, coke and other energy products from and to
numerous companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy, retail and other industries.
Certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. We regularly review contingent matters relating to these customers and our
purchase and sale contracts and we record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable
loss. We believe our previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable losses. The final
resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Other

We are involved in certain legal, regulatory, administrative and environmental proceedings
before various courts, arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning claims arising in
the ordinary course of business. These proceedings include certain contract disputes,
environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and pending
judicial matters. We cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. We regularly
review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are considered probable of loss. The
resolution of pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or
financial statements in the period they are resolved.

See Notes 4 and 5 for a discussion of contingencies related to Regulatory Matters and Nuclear
Operations.

NOTE 14 — RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND TRUSTEED ASSETS

Measurement Date

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we changed the date for actuarial measurement of our
obligations for benefit programs from December 31 to November 30. We believe the one-month change
of the measurement date is a preferable change as it allows time for management to plan and execute
its review of the completeness and accuracy of its benefit programs results and to fully reflect
the impact on its financial results. The change did not have a material effect on retained earnings
as of January 1, 2004, and income from continuing operations, net income and related per share
amounts for any interim period in 2004. Accordingly, all amounts reported in the following tables
for balances as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 are based on measurement dates of
November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2004, respectively. Amounts reported in tables for the year
ended December 31, 2005 are based on a measurement date of November 30, 2004. Amounts reported in
tables for the year ended December 31, 2004 are based on a measurement date of December 31,



2003. Amounts reported in tables for the year ended December 31, 2003 are based on a
measurement date of December 31, 2002.

Qualified and Nonqualified Pension Plan Benefits

We have defined benefit retirement plans for eligible represented and nonrepresented
employees. The plans are noncontributory, cover substantially all employees and provide retirement
benefits based on the employees’ years of benefit service, average final compensation and age at
retirement. Certain represented and nonrepresented employees are covered under cash balance
benefits based on annual employer contributions and interest credits. Our policy is to fund pension
costs by contributing the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
and additional amounts when we deem appropriate. We do not anticipate making a contribution to our
qualified pension plans in 2006.

We also maintain supplemental nonqualified, noncontributory, retirement benefit plans for selected
management employees. These plans provide for benefits that supplement those provided by DTE
Energy’s other retirement plans.

We employ a consistent formal process in determining the long-term rate of return for various
asset classes. We evaluate input from our consultants, including their review of historic financial
market risks and returns and long-term historic relationships between the asset classes of
equities, fixed income and other assets, consistent with the widely accepted capital market
principle that asset classes with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-term.
Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates, asset class risks and asset class returns
are evaluated and considered before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The
long-term portfolio return is also established employing a consistent formal process, with due
consideration of diversification, active investment management and rebalancing. Peer data is
reviewed to check for reasonableness .

We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities, fixed income and other
investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets consistent with prudent levels
of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses over the long-term. Risk
tolerance is established through consideration of future plan cash flows, plan funded status, and
corporate financial considerations. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of
equity, fixed income and other investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across
U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, growth and value investment styles, and large and small market
capitalizations. Other assets such as private equity and absolute return funds are used judiciously
to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Derivatives may be used to
gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to
leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments. Investment risk is
measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic
asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

In December 2002, we recognized an additional minimum pension liability as required under SFAS
No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.

An additional pension liability may be required when
the accumulated benefit obligation of the plan exceeds the fair value of plan assets. Under SFAS
No. 87, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability, an intangible asset and other comprehensive loss. In 2003,
we



reclassified $572 million of other comprehensive loss related to Detroit Edison’s minimum
pension liability to a regulatory asset after the MPSC Staff provided an opinion that the MPSC’s
traditional rate setting process allowed for the recovery of pension costs as measured by SFAS No.
87. The additional minimum pension liability, regulatory asset, intangible asset and other
comprehensive loss are adjusted in December of each year based on the plans’ funded status.

We also sponsor defined contribution retirement savings plans. Participation in one of these plans
is available to substantially all represented and nonrepresented employees. We match employee
contributions up to certain predefined limits based upon eligible compensation, the employee’s
contribution rate and, in some cases, years of credited service. The cost of these plans was $29
million in 2005, $28 million in 2004 and $26 million in 2003.

Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for employees who
are eligible for these benefits. Our policy is to fund certain trusts to meet our postretirement
benefit obligations. Separate qualified Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts
exist for represented and nonrepresented employees. At the discretion of management, we may make up
to a $120 million contribution to our VEBA trusts in 2006.

Benefit
costs were calculated assuming health care cost trend rates beginning
at 9% for 2006
and decreasing to 5% in 2011 and thereafter for persons under age 65 and decreasing from 8% to 5%
for persons age 65 and over. A one-percentage-point increase in health care cost trend rates would
have increased the total service cost and interest cost components of benefit costs by $32 million
and increased the accumulated benefit obligation by $244 million at December 31, 2005. A
one-percentage-point decrease in the health care cost trend rates would have decreased the total
service and interest cost components of benefit costs by $20 million and would have decreased the
accumulated benefit obligation by $203 million at December 31, 2005.

At December 31, 2005, the benefits expected to be paid, including prescription drug benefits, in
each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter are as
follows:

In December 2003, the Medicare Act was signed into law which provides for a non-taxable
federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at
least “actuarially equivalent” to the benefit established by law. As discussed in Note 2, we
adopted FSP No. 106-2 in 2004, which provides guidance on the accounting for the Medicare Act. As
a result of the adoption, our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related
to benefits attributed to past service was reduced by approximately $95 million at January 1, 2004
and was accounted for as an actuarial gain. The effects of the subsidy reduced net periodic
postretirement benefit costs by $20 million in 2005 and $16 million in 2004.

At December 31, 2005, the gross amount of federal subsidies expected to be received in each of the
next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter was as follows:

Grantor Trust

MichCon maintains a Grantor Trust that invests in life insurance contracts and income
securities. Employees and retirees have no right, title or interest in the assets of the Grantor
Trust, and MichCon can revoke the trust
subject to providing the MPSC with prior notification. We account for our investment at fair value
with unrealized gains and losses recorded to earnings.



NOTE 15 — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The DTE Energy Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant of incentive stock options,
non-qualifying stock options, stock awards, performance shares and performance units. A maximum of
18 million shares of common stock may be issued under the plan. Participants in the plan include
our employees and members of our Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2005, no performance units
have been granted under the plan.

Options

Options are exercisable according to the terms of the individual stock option award agreements
and expire 10 years after the date of the grant. The option exercise price equals the fair value
of the stock on the date that the option was granted. Stock option activity was as follows:

Stock Awards

Stock awards granted under the plan are restricted for varying periods, which are generally
for three years. Participants have all rights of a shareholder with respect to a stock award,
including the right to receive dividends and vote the shares. Prior to vesting in stock awards,
the participant: (i) may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange or otherwise dispose of shares; (ii)
shall not retain custody of the share certificates; and (iii) will deliver to us a stock power with
respect to each stock award.

The stock awards are recorded at cost that approximates fair value on the date of grant. We
account for stock awards as unearned compensation, which is recorded as a reduction to common
stock. The cost is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. Stock award
activity for the years ended December 31 was:

Performance Share Awards

Performance shares awarded under the plan are for a specified number of shares of common stock
that entitles the holder to receive a cash payment, shares of common stock or a combination
thereof. The final value of the award is determined by the achievement of certain performance
objectives. The awards vest at the end of a specified period, usually three years. We account for
performance share awards by accruing compensation expense over the vesting period based on: (i) the
number of shares expected to be paid which is based on the probable achievement of performance
objectives; and (ii) the fair value of the shares. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded
compensation expense totaling $5 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively.

During the vesting period, the recipient of a performance share award has no shareholder rights.
However, recipients will be paid an amount equal to the dividend equivalent on such shares.
Performance share awards are nontransferable and are subject to risk of forfeiture. As of December
31, 2005, there were 803,071 performance share awards outstanding.

NOTE 16 — SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

We operate our businesses through three strategic business units, Electric Utility, Gas
Utility and Non-Utility Operations. The balance of our business consists of Corporate & Other.
Based on this structure, we set strategic goals, allocate resources and evaluate performance. This
results in the following reportable segments:

Electric Utility

•

Consists of Detroit Edison, the company’s electric utility whose operations include the
power generation and electric distribution facilities that service approximately 2.2
million residential, commercial and industrial customers throughout southeastern Michigan.



Gas Utility

•

Consists of the gas distribution services provided by MichCon, a gas utility that
purchases, stores and distributes natural gas throughout Michigan to approximately 1.3
million residential, commercial and industrial customers and Citizens Gas Fuel Company, a
gas utility that distributes natural gas in Adrian, Michigan.

Non-utility Operations

•

Power and Industrial Projects

, primarily consisting of synfuel projects, on-site energy
services, steel-related projects, power generation with services, and waste coal recovery
operations;

•

Unconventional Gas Production,

primarily consisting of natural gas exploration,
development and production; and

•

Fuel Transportation and Marketing

, primarily consisting of energy marketing and trading
operations, coal transportation and marketing, and gas pipelines, processing and storage.

Corporate & Other

, primarily consisting of corporate support functions and certain energy related
investments.

The income tax provisions or benefits of DTE Energy’s subsidiaries are determined on an individual
company basis and recognize the tax benefit of production tax credits and net operating losses.
The subsidiaries record income tax payable to or receivable from DTE Energy resulting from the
inclusion of its taxable income or loss in DTE Energy’s consolidated tax return.

Inter-segment
billing for goods and services exchanged between segments is based
upon tariffed or market-based prices of the provider and primarily
consists of power sales, gas sales and coal transportation services
