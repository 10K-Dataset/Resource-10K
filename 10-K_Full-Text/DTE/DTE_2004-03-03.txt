Part I

Items 1. & 2. Business & Properties

GENERAL

In 1995, DTE Energy incorporated in the state of Michigan. Our regulated
operations consist primarily of Detroit Edison and MichCon. We also have
numerous non-regulated subsidiaries engaged in energy marketing and trading,
energy services, and various other electricity, coal and gas related
businesses. DTE Energy is an exempt holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act (PUHCA) of 1935, except Section 9 (a) (2) that relates to
the acquisition of securities of public utility companies and Section 33 that
relates to the acquisition of foreign (non-U.S.) utility companies.

Detroit Edison is a Michigan corporation organized in 1903. Detroit Edison is a
public utility subject to regulation by the MPSC and FERC and is engaged in the
generation, purchase, distribution and sale of electric energy to 2.1 million
customers in a 7,600 square mile area in southeastern Michigan.

MichCon is a Michigan corporation organized in 1898. MichCon became an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of DTE Energy in conjunction with the
acquisition of MCN Energy (which was subsequently merged into Enterprises),
which was completed on May 31, 2001. See Note 3 for a further discussion of the
MCN Energy acquisition. MichCon is a public utility subject to regulation by
the MPSC. MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage, transmission,
distribution and sale of natural gas to 1.2 million customers in a 14,700
square mile area throughout Michigan.

In February 2003, we sold the International Transmission Company (ITC), a FERC
regulated transmission company. See Note 3 for a further discussion of the ITC
sale and its presentation as a discontinued operation.

Our website is www.dteenergy.com. Available free of charge on our website is
information such as previously filed reports with the SEC, press releases and
other informational resources regarding DTE Energy and our subsidiaries. The
information on our website is updated as soon as reasonably practicable. The
information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of
this Form 10-K or any other filing we make with the SEC. Additionally, our
previously filed reports and statements are also available at the SEC’s
website: www.sec.gov.

References in this report to “we,” “us”, “our” or “Company” are to DTE Energy
and its subsidiaries, collectively.



We operate our businesses through three strategic business units (Energy
Resources, Energy Distribution and Energy Gas). The balance of our business
consists of Corporate & Other. Based on this structure, we set strategic
goals, allocate resources and evaluate performance. Each business unit has
regulated and non-regulated operations, and contributed to DTE Energy’s 2003
diluted earnings per share of $3.09. See Note 16 - Segment and Related
Information, for financial information by segment for the last three years. A
discussion of each business follows.

ENERGY RESOURCES

Power Generation

Description

Power Generation comprises our regulated power generation business and plants
within Detroit Edison. These plants are regulated by numerous federal and
state governmental agencies, including the MPSC, the NRC and the EPA.
Electricity is generated from Detroit Edison’s numerous fossil plants, its
hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant, and purchased from
electricity generators, suppliers and wholesalers. The electricity we produce
and purchase is sold to four major classes of customers: residential,
commercial, industrial and wholesale, principally throughout Michigan, the
Midwest and Ontario, Canada.

Weather, economic factors and electricity prices affect sales levels to
customers. Our peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during
the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning and other
cooling-related demands. Power generation sales are made to a diverse base of
customers in both type and number; sales levels are not dependent on any small
market segment. However, due to residential rate subsidization, less than 1% of
the customers constitute approximately 80% of the power



generation margin. Additionally, business customers who have elected to
participate in the electric Customer Choice program are having a significant
unfavorable effect on our financial performance.

Our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with market
purchases. The table below details our energy supply mix and average cost per
unit:

(1)

Represents fuel costs associated with power plants.

(2)

Includes amounts associated with hedging activities.

We expect an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation
to serve customers. The effect of lost sales due the electric Customer Choice
program has reduced our need for purchased power and increased our ability to
sell power in the wholesale market. We have short and long-term supply
contracts for expected fuel and purchased power requirements as detailed in the
following table:


Expected Supply

Contracted

Open

Coal


%


%

Natural Gas


%


%

Purchased Power


%


%

Power Generation’s generating capability is heavily dependent upon coal. The
coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under
agreements that vary in both pricing and terms. Detroit Edison expects to
obtain the majority of its coal requirements through long-term contracts with
the balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot purchases.
Detroit Edison has contracts with three coal suppliers for a total purchase of
up to 28 million tons of low-sulfur western coal to be delivered from 2004
through 2008. Detroit Edison also has a contract with a supplier for the
purchase of approximately 4 million tons of Appalachian coal to be delivered
from 2004 through 2006. These existing long-term coal contracts include
provisions for price escalation as well as de-escalation. Given the geographic
diversity of supply, Detroit Edison believes it can meet the expected
generation requirements. We own and lease a fleet of rail cars and have
long-term transportation contracts with companies to provide rail and vessel
services for delivery of purchased coal to our generating facilities.

We purchase power from other electricity generators, suppliers and wholesalers.
These purchases supplement our generation capability to meet customer demand
during peak cycles. For example, when high temperatures occur during the summer
we require additional electricity to meet demand. This access to additional
power is an efficient and economical way to meet our obligation to customers
without increasing capital expenditures to build additional base-load power
facilities.



Regulation

Detroit Edison’s Power Generation business is subject to the regulatory
jurisdiction of various agencies, including the MPSC, FERC and NRC. The MPSC
issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the
costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of service,
accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit Edison’s MPSC-approved rates
charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery
of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on our investments. The FERC
regulates Detroit Edison with respect to financing authorization and wholesale
electric activities. The NRC has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of
the operation, construction, licensing and decommissioning of Detroit Edison’s
Fermi 2 nuclear plant.

Since 1996 there have been several important acts, orders, court rulings and
legislative actions in the state of Michigan that affect our Power Generation
operations. In 1996, the MPSC began an initiative designed to give all of
Michigan’s electric customers access to electricity supplied by other
generators and marketers. In 1998, the MPSC authorized the electric Customer
Choice program that allowed for a limited number of customers to purchase
electricity from suppliers other than their local utility. The local utility
would continue to transport the electric supply to the customers’ facilities,
thereby retaining distribution margins. The electric Customer Choice program
was phased in over a three-year period, with all customers having the option to
choose their electric supplier by January 2002.

In 2000, the Michigan Legislature enacted legislation that reduced electric
rates by 5% and reaffirmed January 2002 as the date for full implementation of
the electric Customer Choice program. This legislation also contained
provisions freezing rates through 2003 and preventing rate increases for
residential customers through 2005 and for small business customers through
2004. The legislation and an MPSC order issued in 2001 established a
methodology to enable Detroit Edison to recover stranded costs related to its
generation operations that may not otherwise be recoverable due to electric
Customer Choice related lost sales and margins. The legislation also provides
for the recovery of the costs associated with the implementation of electric
Customer Choice program. The MPSC has determined that these costs be treated
as regulatory assets. Additionally, the legislation provides for recovery of
costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes, laws and other governmental
actions including the Clean Air Act.

Due to MPSC orders issued in 1997 and 1998 that altered the regulatory process
in Michigan and provided a plan for transition to electric Customer Choice for
the generation business of Detroit Edison, effective December 1998, Detroit
Edison’s generation business no longer met the criteria of SFAS No. 71,
“

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation

.” Since the June
2000 legislation was enacted into law and with the issuance of subsequent
clarifying MPSC orders in 2001 and 2002, rates for retail customers and
transition charges for electric Customer Choice customers will be set to
recover Detroit Edison’s generation costs. Such costs will be billed and
recovered from both retail and choice customers and thus satisfy the criteria
of SFAS No. 71. In addition, we have the legislative authority to defer
regulatory costs in 2002 and 2003 and to begin recovery of such costs starting
in 2004 after the mandated rate freeze expires. The recovery of these costs is
dependent on authorization from the MPSC. As a result, we resumed application
of SFAS No. 71 for our generation business in the fourth quarter of 2002.

In June 2003, Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC for a change in
retail electric rates, resumption of the Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR)
mechanism, and recovery of net stranded costs. Detroit Edison is specifically
requesting authority to increase rates by $427 million annually with a
three-year phase in as customers’ rate caps expire. In February
2004, the MPSC authorized an interim base rate increase of
$248 million annually.

For additional information regarding our regulatory environment, see Note 4 -
Regulatory Matters.

Strategy and Competition

We continue to strive to be the preferred electricity supplier in southeast
Michigan. We believe that we can accomplish our goal by working with our
customers, communities and regulatory agencies to be a reliable low cost
supplier of electricity. To control expenses, we optimize our fuel blends
thereby taking maximum advantage of low cost, environmentally friendly
low-sulfur western coals. To ensure generation reliability we will continue to
make investments in our generating plants that will improve plant availability
and improve operating efficiencies. Revenues from year to year will vary due
to weather conditions, economic factors, regulatory events and other risk
factors as discussed in the “Risk Factors” section that follows.

Effective January 1, 2002, the electric Customer Choice program expanded in
Michigan whereby all of the Company’s electric customers can choose to purchase
their electricity from alternative suppliers of generation services. Detroit
Edison lost 16% of retail sales in 2003 and 6% of such sales in 2002 as a
result of customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under
the electric Customer
Choice program. If regulatory or legislative changes are not made, we expect to
lose between 17% to 20% of retail sales in 2004 as a result of customers
choosing to participate in the program. Customers participating in the electric
Customer Choice program consist primarily of industrial and large



commercial
customers. There is a significant price difference in the wholesale and retail
markets, which only allows for partial offset of the lost revenue from customer
choice migration. We will continue to aggressively utilize the wholesale market
to sell the generation made available by the electric Customer Choice program.

Energy Services

Description

Non-regulated Energy Services has three business lines: Coal-Based Fuels,
On-Site Energy Projects and Merchant Generation.

Coal-Based Fuels

Coal-Based Fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel
plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants. Both processes
generate tax credits under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 29
is designed to stimulate investment in and development of alternate fuel
sources. We have private letter rulings from the IRS for all of our synfuel
plants. Synfuel-related Section 29 tax credits expire in 2007. Section 29 tax
credits for two of our three coke batteries expired at the end of 2002 with the
third expiring in 2007.

The synthetic fuel process involves chemically modifying and binding particles
of coal to produce a fuel that is used for power generation and coke
production. The modification involves a three-step process that produces a
solid synthetic fuel product. During 2002, we sold a 95% interest in two of our
synfuel plants, and in 2003, we sold a 99% interest in one of our synfuel
plants and a 59% interest in two other plants. In January 2004, we sold an
additional 40% interest in two of the previously sold plants, reducing our
interest to 1%. We continue to consolidate these projects due to our
controlling influence.

The coke battery facilities produce coke that is used in blast furnaces within
the steel industry. DTE Energy is one of the largest producers in the U.S. of
coke for the steel industry. During 2001, we sold a 49% interest in two of our
coke battery projects, and in 2002, consistent with the original purchase and
sale agreement, our third coke battery project interest was reduced from 95% to
5%.

Strategy and Competition

Our strategy for Energy Services is to continue leveraging our extensive
energy-related operating experience and project management capability to
develop and grow the on-site energy business. We continue to evaluate
opportunities to sell interests in all of our synfuel plants in 2004. We also
continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset management and operations
services to third parties.

We anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we
operate. In determining the markets in which to compete, we examine closely the
regulatory environment, the number of competitors and our ability to achieve
sustainable margins. We plan to maximize the effectiveness of our
inter-related businesses as we expand from our current regional focus. As we
pursue growth opportunities, our first priority will be to achieve value-added
returns, and then trend towards increased operational scale.

We plan to focus on the following areas for growth:

•

Optimization of our synfuel portfolio;

•

Providing operating services to owners of power plants;

•

Expansion of on-site energy projects; and

•

Development of new tax advantaged opportunities.

Energy Marketing & Trading

Description

Energy Marketing & Trading consists of the wholesale electric and gas marketing
and trading operations of DTE Energy Trading Company and CoEnergy. We acquired
CoEnergy as part of the MCN Energy acquisition in May 2001. Energy Marketing &
Trading focuses on physical power marketing and structured transactions for
large customers, as well as the enhancement of returns from DTE Energy’s power
plants, pipeline and storage assets

.

In pursuing these goals, Energy Marketing
& Trading may enter into forwards, futures, swaps and option contracts.

Strategy and Competition

Our strategy for Energy Marketing & Trading is to execute on our vision of the
role energy trading plays in delivering value-added services to our customers.
Many of the former major market players have either ceased as going concerns or
are no longer engaged in the energy trading business. We seek to manage this
business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our
other business segments. We plan to focus on physical marketing and the
optimization of our portfolio of energy assets. We have risk management and
credit policies to monitor and minimize risk.

Coal Services

Description

Coal Services provides fuel, transportation and equipment management services
tailored to the individual requirements of each customer. We specialize in
minimizing energy production costs and maximizing reliability of supply for
energy-intensive customers. Our external customers include electric utilities,
merchant power producers, integrated steel mills and large industrial companies
with significant energy requirements. We also operate a number of railcar
maintenance and repair facilities serving coal
transporters, as well as other industries and rail car types. We participate
in the trading of coal and emissions credits as well as coal-to-power tolling
transactions. During 2003, we entered into the waste coal recovery business by
purchasing a patented technology and constructing our first commercial
facility.

Properties

We lease approximately 2,600 rail cars. We own fixed and mobile railcar
maintenance and repair facilities in Nebraska and Indiana. We completed
construction of a waste coal recovery facility on the site of a former
operating coal mine in Ohio.

Strategy and Competition

We continue to leverage our position as one of the top North American coal
marketers and our reputation as an efficient manager of transportation assets.
Trends such as railroad and mining consolidation and the financial uncertainty
of many mining firms could have an impact on how we compete in the future. We
will continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and
competitive access to the energy requirements of our customers.

We acquired the rights to a proprietary technology that produces high quality
coal products from fine coal slurries that are typically discarded from coal
mining operations. The technology has the additional benefit of improving the
environment by allowing us to restore the land in accordance with reclamation
requirements of each state. The technology produces a fine-coal fuel by
removing mineral matter, clay-sized impurities and oxides from waste material.
The fine-coal fuel can be used in power plants, as a feedstock for synthetic
fuel production and for other industrial applications. Our first facility in
Ohio became operational in late-2003 and has the capacity to produce more than
500,000 tons of fine coal per year. We are negotiating an agreement for a
second facility and plan to site three to five additional facilities in 2004.
We believe that the waste coal recovery business will contribute significantly
to future earnings and provide significant environmental benefits.

Biomass

Description

Biomass develops, owns and operates landfill gas recovery systems in the U.S.
Landfill gas, a by product of solid waste decomposition, is composed of
approximately equal portions of methane and carbon dioxide. Converting the
methane into a renewable energy resource conserves fossil fuels. Biomass
operations generate Section 29 tax credits through 2007.

Biomass helps limit potential greenhouse gas emissions by developing and
implementing landfill gas recovery systems that capture the gas and use it
productively. Such a recovery system eliminates detrimental air emissions by
preventing methane from escaping into the atmosphere or migrating off-site and
becoming a safety hazard. Landfill gas recovery systems also provide local
utilities, industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive,
renewable source of energy. Applications for this form of energy include steam
and electricity generation, fueling of asphalt plants and brick kilns and for
processing into pipeline quality gas.

Strategy and Competition

Biomass’ strategy capitalizes upon our industry experience of over 20 years. We
are evaluating business growth through both development and acquisitions. We
compete primarily with fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal. However, we
believe the environmental benefits of biomass along with reasonable and
economic access to landfill sites provide a platform for future growth.

ENERGY DISTRIBUTION

Power Distribution

Description

The electric distribution services of Detroit Edison comprise our regulated
Power Distribution business. This business distributes electricity generated
by Energy Resources’ Power Generation business and alternative electric
suppliers to Detroit Edison’s 2.1 million customers in southeastern Michigan.
This business also shares, with the Gas Distribution segment, the customer
service function for our utilities. Accordingly, costs associated with this
function, including collections, our call center and uncollectable accounts
receivable is shared between Power Distribution and Gas Distribution.

In January 2003, we sold the steam heating business of Detroit Edison to
Thermal Ventures II, LP. In February 2003 we sold ITC to an affiliate of
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. and Trimaran Capital Partners, LLC. ITC will
continue to provide transmission services to the Energy Distribution business
at rates that will be recovered from Detroit Edison’s utility customers.

Weather and economic factors affect our sales and revenues. Similar to the
Power Generation business, our peak load and highest total system sales
generally occur during the third quarter of the year driven by air conditioning
and cooling-related demands. Power Distribution’s sales are not dependent upon
a limited number of customers. Additionally, customers participating in the
electric Customer Choice program do not impact Power Distribution’s operating
revenues or the number of customers served. The loss of any one or a few
customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Power
Distribution.

Regulation

Detroit Edison’s Power Distribution is subject to the jurisdiction of the
MPSC and the FERC, which have regulatory authority over rates, conditions of
service and other operating-related matters. As previously discussed, Michigan
legislation prevents Detroit Edison from increasing rates to residential
customers through 2005 and for small business customers through 2004. By order
of the FERC, rates charged by ITC will remain at current levels through
December 2004.

In June 2003, Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC for a
change in retail electric rates, resumption of the PSCR mechanism, and recovery
of net stranded costs. In February 2004, the MPSC authorized an
interim base rate increase of $248 million annually. See Note 4 for further discussion of the Electric
Transitional Rate Plan filing.

In January 2004, the MPSC issued an order adopting rules governing service
quality and reliability standards for electric distribution systems. The
reliability standards establish performance levels for service restoration,
wire-down relief requests, customer call answer time, customer complaint
response, meter reading and new service installations. The order also
establishes penalties for delays in service restoration during normal
conditions, catastrophic storms and repetitive outages. Detroit Edison is
required to file an annual report providing information regarding performance
against the measures provided and any penalties incurred.

For additional information regarding our regulatory environment, see Note 4 –
Regulatory Matters.

Energy Assistance Programs

Energy assistance programs funded by
the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain
critical to Detroit Edison’s ability to control its uncollectable accounts
receivable and collections expenses.

Detroit Edison’s uncollectable accounts receivable expense is directly affected
by the level of government funded assistance its qualifying customers receive.
We are working with the State of Michigan and others to increase the share of
funding allocated to our customers to be representative of the number of
low-income individuals in our service territory.

Properties

Detroit Edison owns and operates 663 distribution substations with a capacity
of approximately 31,079,000 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and approximately 407,000
line transformers with a capacity of approximately 24,542,000 kVA.
Substantially all of the net utility properties of Detroit Edison are subject
to the lien of its mortgage. Circuit miles of distribution lines owned and in
service as of December 31, 2003 are as follows:

There are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity
between Detroit Edison and electricity providers external to its service area.
These interconnections are owned and operated by ITC and connect to neighboring
energy companies.

Strategy and Competition

Our strategy focuses on improving the quality of customer service and lowering
operating costs by improving operating efficiencies as well as targeting
capital investments in areas that have the greatest impact on reliability
improvements with the goal of managing distribution rates charged to utility
customers.

The decision to sell ITC is consistent with our strategic view that
maximization of shareholder value and high levels of customer service are best
achieved with assets that we own, operate and over which we exercise
significant control. As Detroit Edison’s rates are designed to recover
transmission costs, billings to Detroit Edison from ITC will be recovered from
Detroit Edison’s utility customers. Rates charged by ITC to Detroit Edison
will, by FERC order, remain at current levels through December 2004.
Thereafter, rates would be subject to normal FERC regulation and market forces.

Competition in the regulated electrical distribution business is provided
primarily by on-site generation by industrial customers and distributed
generation applications by industrial and commercial customers. We do not
expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in
the near term.

Distributed Generation

Description

Distributed Generation, primarily consisting of DTE Energy Technologies
(Dtech), has investments in emerging technologies that complement our existing
businesses. We currently develop, market and distribute a portfolio of
distributed generation products, provide application engineering, and monitor
and manage system operations. Distributed generation units seek to generate
safe, clean, reliable power at or near the point of use, rather than at large
central power stations, which can also provide very high
efficiencies due to effective use of waste heat. Distributed generation
products can use a range of technologies, including internal combustion
engines, external combustion engines, mini-turbines and fuel cells.

The number of megawatts (MW) of distributed generation delivered has
increased since 2001, while the average unit size has also increased. Dtech has
begun to shift more of its focus on larger industrial and commercial markets
and, in particular, on continuous rather than standby generation, and away from
the relatively higher volume, smaller margin, residential and small commercial
markets. The following table details the distributed generation capacity delivered
for the past three years.






Distributed Generation Capacity Delivered

94 MW

89 MW

65 MW

Strategy and Competition

Our goal is to become a profitable participant in the emerging distributed
generation market, providing one-stop shopping that meets customers’ total
energy needs. Key milestones toward this success include full commercialization
of our internal combustion engine-driven products as well as our monitoring and
system operations management. Our sales structure is in place and we are
continuing to expand our project support capabilities, both directly and with
partners.

Our strategy is to increase our focus on our proprietary pre-engineered
and packaged continuous generation products. Provisions in current as well as
proposed federal and state laws are expected to provide us additional
opportunities via tax credits, energy efficiency and renewable portfolio
standards.

Competition in the distributed generation business comes from distributors
and manufacturers of stand-by and continuous duty generators. The success of
this business depends on the continued development of new products and the
expansion of customer acceptance.

ENERGY GAS

Gas Distribution

Description

Gas Distribution operations primarily consist of MichCon, our regulated gas
utility. Gas Distribution provides gas sales and transportation delivery
services to 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers
located throughout Michigan. As previously discussed, this business also shares
with the Power Distribution segment, the customer service function for our
utilities.

The following table details sales and deliveries to these customers.

(1)

Includes the operations of MichCon from May 31, 2001 acquisition
date.

Gas Distribution makes gas sales primarily to residential and small-volume
commercial and industrial customers. It provides end user transportation to
large-volume commercial and industrial customers and gas Customer Choice
customers who purchase natural gas directly from other suppliers and utilize
MichCon’s pipeline network to transport the gas to the customers’ facilities.
Gas Distribution provides



intermediate transportation to producers, brokers and
other gas companies that own the natural gas transported, but are not the
ultimate consumers. MichCon’s revenues and net income are impacted by weather
and are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the year due to
heating-related demand. MichCon’s operations are not dependent upon a limited
number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers is not
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on MichCon.

We obtain our natural gas supply from various sources in different geographic
areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms.


Gas Distribution

Contracted Supply

Fixed Price Purchases


%

Market Price Purchases


%


%

Supply under contract represents approximately 75% of the expected 180 Bcf of
supply requirements in 2004. We expect to meet the balance of gas supply
requirements through open market purchases. As a result of varying demand
primarily due to weather, MichCon may use existing gas in inventory to meet
unanticipated customer obligations. Given the geographic diversity of supply,
coupled with its 124 Bcf of storage capacity, MichCon believes it can meet the
supply requirements for customers. MichCon has long-term firm transportation
agreements expiring on various dates through 2011 for delivery of purchased
natural gas to our distribution system.

Regulation

MichCon is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues
orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of
regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting and operating-related
matters. MichCon is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies
with respect to safety, the environment and health.

In the late 1990s, the MPSC began an initiative designed to give all of
Michigan’s natural gas customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit
from lower gas costs resulting from competition. In 1999, the MPSC approved a
comprehensive experimental three-year gas Customer Choice program that allowed
an increasing number of customers to purchase natural gas from suppliers other
than their local utility. The local utility would continue to transport the
natural gas supply to the customers’ facilities, thereby retaining distribution
margins. In December 2001, the MPSC issued an order that continues the gas
Customer Choice program on a permanent and expanding basis beginning with the
conclusion of the three-year temporary program on March 31, 2002. Under the
expanded program, beginning April 1,
2002, up to approximately 40% of customers could elect to purchase gas from
suppliers other than MichCon. Beginning in April 2003, up to approximately 60%
of customers could participate, and beginning April 2004, all 1.2 million of
MichCon’s gas customers could choose to participate. Since MichCon continues to
transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at prices
comparable to margins earned on gas sales, customers switching to other
suppliers have little impact on MichCon’s earnings.

Under the December 2001 MPSC order, MichCon returned to a gas cost recovery
(GCR) mechanism, effective January 2002. Under this mechanism, MichCon’s gas
sales rates include a gas commodity component designed to recover its actual
gas costs and therefore does not have a commodity price risk for prudently
incurred gas costs. During 2001, MichCon was under a Gas Sales Program and
incurred commodity price risk associated with its ability to secure gas
supplies at prices less than $2.95 per Mcf.

In September 2003, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for an increase
in service and distribution charges (base rates) for its gas sales and
transportation customers. The filing requests an



overall increase in base
rates of $194 million per year (approximately 7% increase, inclusive of gas
costs), beginning January 1, 2005. MichCon has requested that the MPSC
increase base rates by $154 million per year on an interim basis by April 1,
2004. The interim request is based on a projected revenue deficiency for the
test year 2004.

For additional information regarding our regulatory environment, see Note 4 -
Regulatory Matters.

Energy Assistance Programs

Energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the State of
Michigan, remain
critical to MichCon’s ability to control its uncollectable accounts receivable
expenses.

As previously discussed, we are working with the State of Michigan and others
to increase the share of funding allocated to our customers to be
representative of the number of low-income individuals in our service
territory.

Properties

MichCon owns distribution, transmission and storage properties and facilities
that are all located in the state of Michigan. At December 31, 2003, MichCon’s
distribution system included approximately 18,000 miles of distribution mains,
approximately 1,148,000 service lines and approximately 1,279,000 active
meters. MichCon owns approximately 2,600 miles of transmission lines that
deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect its storage
fields with the sources of supply and the market areas. MichCon owns
properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an
aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 124 Bcf. Substantially
all of the net utility properties of MichCon are subject to the lien of its
mortgage.

Strategy and competition

The strategy of the Gas Distribution business is to expand our role as the
preferred provider of natural gas in Michigan. As a result of more efficient
furnaces and appliances, we expect future revenues to remain at current levels
or slightly decline. To partially offset these factors, we plan initiatives to
expand our gas markets, as well as by continuing to provide energy-related
services that capitalize on our expertise, capabilities and efficient systems.
We also anticipate increased revenues through increased rates as a result of
our rate case, which was filed on September 30, 2003 (see Note 4).

Competition in the gas business primarily involves alternate fuels and energy
sources. Natural gas continues to be the preferred space and water-heating
fuel. Developers select natural gas in new
construction because of the convenience, cleanliness and relative price
advantage compared to propane, fuel oil and other alternative fuels.

Gas Production

Description

The Gas Production business owns one of the industry’s largest Antrim gas
reserve bases predominantly located in the northern portion of the lower
peninsula of Michigan. Our emphasis is on developing and producing the 351.9
Bcfe of proved reserves we owned as of December 31, 2003. We drilled 80 wells
(68 net of interest of others) in 2003 with a success rate in excess of 90%.
Wells drilled in the Antrim shale formation have high success rates and low
drilling costs, and are therefore considered low risk.

Gas Production is also involved in the coal bed methane business
which is a joint undertaking between Energy Gas and Energy Resources that
leverages our gas capabilities with the skills and experience of other
non-regulated businesses.



Properties

The Michigan properties had 23.2 Bcfe of production in 2003. Gas Production
does not anticipate adding a significant amount of new reserves to its 351.9
Bcfe of proven reserves at December 31, 2003.

Strategy

The Gas Production business is aggressively managing its Michigan gas producing
assets to maximize returns on investment. We have operator responsibilities for
our Michigan properties with the goal of optimizing the costs of producing
reserves. Gas Production has rights to 94,866 acres (81,133 net of interest of
others) of undeveloped leases. During 2004, Gas Production plans to continue
developing this acreage.

In order to leverage our gas production capabilities and the skills and
experience of other non-regulated businesses, we will continue to invest in
opportunities in the coal bed methane business. As of December 31, 2003, the
coal bed methane business has rights to 4,034 acres (3,156 net of interest of
others) of undeveloped leases in Oklahoma. During 2004, the coal bed
methane business plans
to drill its first operated wells in Oklahoma.

Gas Storage, Pipelines & Processing

Description

The Gas Storage, Pipelines & Processing business has partnership interests in
an interstate transmission pipeline, Vector Pipeline (Vector), seven carbon
dioxide processing facilities and a 9.7 Bcf natural gas storage field.
Additionally, we lease a 42.5 Bcf natural gas storage field located in
Michigan.

Strategy and Competition

Gas Storage, Pipelines & Processing focuses on opportunities in the
Midwest-to-Northeast region that supply natural gas to meet growing demand. We
expect much of the growth in the demand for natural gas in the United States to
occur within the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions. These regions currently
lack the pipeline capacity and low-cost storage necessary to deliver gas
volumes to meet growing demand. Vector is an interstate pipeline that is
intended to fill a large portion of that need, and is complemented by Energy
Gas’ significant storage capacity. Gas Storage, Pipelines & Processing has
interests in seven processing plants that extract carbon dioxide from Antrim
gas production making it suitable for transportation to nearby markets.
Additionally, we have contract rights in natural gas storage fields, capable of
storing up to 52.2 Bcf. We plan to continue identifying asset opportunities
related to natural gas, storage and transmission and working with other DTE
Energy affiliates to secure the market required to support asset investment.



CORPORATE & OTHER

Description

Corporate & Other includes the administrative and general expenses of various
corporate support functions such as accounting, legal and information
technology. These functions essentially support the entire company and the
related costs are allocated to the various segments based on services utilized.
Additionally, Corporate & Other holds certain non-regulated debt and
investments, including assets held for sale and in emerging energy
technologies.

Strategy and Competition

Our energy technology strategy is to invest in a profitable portfolio of energy
technology companies that facilitate the creation of new businesses, and expand
growth opportunities for existing DTE Energy businesses. We seek to gain early
experience in emerging energy sectors where energy trends and technologies may
create potentially profitable opportunities. The investment portfolio consists
of direct investments in energy technology companies and venture funds.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to extensive environmental regulation. Additional costs may
result as the effects of various chemicals on the environment are studied and
governmental regulations are developed and implemented. We expect to continue
recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates
charged to our customers. Greater details on environmental issues are provided
in the following Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:

Commitments and Contingencies

Detroit Edison

Detroit Edison is subject to applicable permit requirements, and to potentially
increasing stringent federal, state and local standards covering among other
things, particulate and gaseous stack emission limitations, the discharge of
waste into lakes and streams and the handling and disposal of waste material.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued ozone transport
regulations and, in December, 2003, proposed additional emission regulations
relating to ozone, fine particulate and mercury air pollution. The new rules
have led to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and particulate emissions. To
comply with these new controls, Detroit Edison has spent approximately $560
million through December 2003 and estimates that it will spend
approximately $40 million in 2004 and incur up to an
additional $1.2 billion of future capital expenditures over the next five to
eight years to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control requirements.
The EPA initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities
citing violations of new source provisions of the Clean Air Act. Detroit Edison
received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject.
In October 2003, the EPA promulgated revised regulations to clarify new source review provisions
going forward. Several states and environmental organizations
have challenged these regulations and in December 2003 the Court
stayed the implementation of the regulations until the U.S. Court of
Appeals D.C. Circuit renders an opinion in the case.
We cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon Detroit Edison.

Detroit Edison is required to demonstrate that the cooling water intake
structures at all of its facilities minimize adverse environmental impact.
Detroit Edison filed such demonstrations and in the event of a final adverse
decision, may be required to install additional control technologies to further
minimize the impact.



Various state and federal laws regulate Detroit Edison’s handling, storage and
disposal of its waste materials. The EPA and the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) have aggressive programs to manage the clean up of
contaminated property. Detroit Edison has extensive land holdings and, from
time to time, must investigate claims of improperly disposed contaminants.
Detroit Edison anticipates it will be periodically included in these types of
environmental proceedings.

MichCon and Citizens

Prior to the construction of major natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and
other uses was manufactured from processes involving coal, coke or oil.
Enterprises (MichCon and Citizens, a wholly owned gas utility located in
Adrian, Michigan) owns, or previously owned, 18 such former manufactured gas
plant (MGP) sites. Investigations have revealed contamination related to the
by-products of gas manufacturing at each site. Enterprises is remediating
seven of the former MGP sites and conducting more extensive investigations
at six other former MGP sites. Enterprises received MDEQ closure
of one site and a
determination that it is not a responsible party for three other
sites. Enterprises received closure from the EPA in 2002 for one
site. While
we cannot make any assurances, we believe that a cost deferral and rate
recovery mechanism approved by the MPSC will prevent these costs from having a
material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Other

Our non-regulated affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and
regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various
pollutants. We believe these non-regulated affiliates are in substantial
compliance with all environmental requirements.



RISK FACTORS

There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE Energy’s
regulated and non-regulated businesses. To provide a framework to understand
the operating environment of DTE Energy, we are providing a brief explanation
of the more significant risks associated with our businesses. Although we
have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the
future. Each of the following risks could affect our performance.

Electric Customer Choice

– Without regulatory and legislative changes, the
negative impact of the electric Customer Choice program will continue to impact
our financial performance.

Weather

– Weather significantly affects our operations. Deviations from normal
hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow. Mild
temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets, lowering income
and cash flow. Damage due to ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage
our infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur
material unplanned expenses.

Competition

– Deregulation and restructuring in the electric and gas industry,
could result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could affect
the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of our regulated
businesses.

Rate regulation

– We operate in a regulated industry. Our electric and gas
rates are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be increased without their
authorization. We may be impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the
MPSC, FERC or other regulatory bodies. New legislation, regulations or
interpretations could change how our business operates, impact our ability to
recover costs through rate increases or require us to incur additional
expenses. There is no assurance that our currently pending electric and gas
rate increases will be granted.

Section 29 tax credits

– We have generated Section 29 tax credits from our
synfuel, coke battery, biomass and gas production operations. Generating
Section 29 tax credits is important to minimizing our income tax expense.
Although, we have received favorable private letter rulings on all of our
synfuel plants, the generation of tax credits is subject to audit and review by
the Internal Revenue Service. If we do not prevail through the administrative
and legal processes, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for
previously recognized Section 29 tax credits that could impact our earnings and
cash flows. Four of our synfuel facilities are under audit by the IRS for 2001.
The value of future credits generated may be affected by new tax legislation.
The combination of overall industry audits of Section 29 credits, supply and
demand for investment in credit producing activities and new tax legislation
could hinder our plan to sell interests in tax credit properties that could
have an impact on our earnings and cash flows. We
have also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the
sales of interests in our synfuel facilities.

Credit ratings –

Increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory
changes, as well as changes in our economic performance could result in credit
agencies reexamining our credit rating. Several of the credit agencies have
placed a “negative outlook” on our ratings due primarily to the uncertainty
regarding our electric and gas rate cases. A downgrade in our rating could
restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase
our borrowing costs.

Regional and national economic conditions

– Our businesses follow the economic
cycles of the customers we serve. Should national or regional economic
conditions decline, reduced volumes of electricity and gas we supply will
result in decreased earnings and cash flow. Economic conditions in our service
territory also impact our collections of accounts receivable.

Environmental laws and liability

– We are subject to numerous environmental
regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater
discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Compliance with these
regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and
plant down times. These laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of
environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals.
We may also incur liabilities because of our emission of gases that may cause
changes in the climate. The regulatory environment is subject to significant
change and, therefore, we cannot predict future issues.



Additionally, we may become a responsible party for environmental clean up at
sites identified by a regulatory body. We cannot predict with certainty the
amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters
because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs. There is also
uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose
joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties.

Operation of nuclear facilities –

Ownership of an operating nuclear generating
plant subjects Detroit Edison to significant additional risks. These risks
among others, include plant security, environmental regulation and remediation,
and operational factors than can significantly impact the performance and cost
of operating a nuclear facility.

Supply and price of raw materials

– We are dependent on coal for much of our
electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuation and supply disruptions could
have a negative impact on our ability to profitably generate electricity. Our
access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for
our regulated gas customers. We have hedging policies in place to mitigate
negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices.

Labor relations

– Unions represent a majority of our employees. A union
choosing to strike as a negotiating tactic would have an impact on our
business. We have begun negotiations with unions for contracts expiring in 2004
and cannot predict the outcome. An unfavorable outcome, such as a strike, could
adversely impact the business.

Unplanned outages

– Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce
electricity or comply with environmental regulations. This occurrence could
result in spot market purchases of electricity in excess of our costs of
generation.

Access to capital markets and interest rates

– Our ability to access capital
markets is important to operate our businesses. Heightened concerns about the
energy industry, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the
market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets. Changes in
interest rates could increase our borrowing costs.

Cash flows from subsidiaries

- Cash flows from subsidiaries are required to
pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities. Should
a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE
Energy, our ability to pay dividends and interest would be restricted.

Property tax reform

– We are one of the largest payers of property taxes in the
state of Michigan. Should the legislature change how schools are financed, we
could face increased property taxes on our Michigan facilities.

Insurance

– While we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide
coverage for various types of risks, catastrophic damage as a result of acts of
God, terrorism, war or a combination of significant unforeseen events could
impact our operations and economic losses might not be covered in full by
insurance.

Terrorism

– Damage to downstream infrastructure or our own assets by terrorist
groups would impact our operations.

Energy trading markets

– Events in the energy trading industry have increased
the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as
a whole. A decline in the confidence in the energy trading market along with
stricter credit requirements has led to a decrease in the number of trading
entities resulting in decreased liquidity in the energy trading market.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

DTE Energy is a diversified energy company with approximately $7 billion in
revenues in 2003 and approximately $21 billion in assets at December 31, 2003.
We are the parent company of Detroit Edison and MichCon, regulated electric and
gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and
natural gas sales and distribution services throughout southeastern Michigan.
Additionally, we have numerous non-regulated subsidiaries involved in
energy-related businesses predominantly in the Midwest and eastern U.S.

The majority of our earnings are derived from utility operations and the
production of synthetic fuel, which qualifies for Section 29 tax credits.
Earnings in 2003 were $521 million, or $3.09 per diluted share, down from 2002
earnings of $632 million, or $3.83 per diluted share. Earnings from continuing
operations in 2003 were $480 million, or $2.85 per diluted share, compared to
2002 earnings from continuing operations of $586 million, or $3.55 per diluted
share. The 18% decrease in income reflects significantly lower utility
earnings, partially offset by increased contributions from our non-regulated
businesses. Our 2003 financial performance was primarily influenced by:

Weather

– Earnings in our electric and gas utilities are seasonal and extremely
sensitive to weather. Electric utility earnings are dependent on hot summer
weather while the gas utility’s results are driven by cold winter weather. We
experienced both milder summer and winter weather during 2003, which negatively
impacted sales demand. The lower demand reduced current year earnings by $64
million compared to 2002, which was an above-normal weather demand year.

Additionally, we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage
our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages. Our
current year earnings were affected by several catastrophic wind and ice
storms, as well as by the August blackout. Restoration and other costs
associated with these power outages lowered 2003 earnings by an additional $31
million compared to 2002.

Electric Customer Choice Program

- The electric Customer Choice program as
originally structured in Michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a
totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be
charged market-based rates for their electricity. However, Detroit Edison’s
rates continue to be regulated by the MPSC, while alternative suppliers can
charge market-based rates. This continued regulation has hindered Detroit
Edison’s ability to retain customers. Detroit Edison’s results have been
unfavorably impacted by the lack of recovery of lost margins and other costs
associated with the electric Customer Choice program. Under Michigan
legislation, we are allowed to recover net stranded costs associated with the
electric Customer Choice program. To date, the MPSC has not fully implemented
various provisions of Michigan’s restructuring legislation. Specifically, the
MPSC:

•

has not finalized all the components for calculating net stranded
costs;

•

has created a process whereby net stranded costs would be recovered
two years after the costs were actually incurred;

•

has not authorized timely recovery of any implementation costs
associated with the electric Customer Choice program; and

•

has created artificial incentives to encourage participation in the
electric Customer Choice program

In addition, the MPSC has maintained regulated rates for certain groups of
customers that exceed the cost of service to those customers. This has
resulted in high levels of participation in the electric Customer Choice
program by those customers that have the highest price relative to their cost
of service. As a result, we continue to lose sales each year and are seeing an
accelerating pace of migration towards the end of 2003. Lost margins and
electricity volumes associated with electric Customer Choice were



approximately
$120 million and 7,281 gigawatthour (gWh) in 2003, compared with $50 million
and 3,510 gWh in 2002.  In February 2004, the MPSC authorized an
interim base rate increase that recognized a revenue deficiency for
lost Choice revenues, and eliminated transition credits and
implemented a transition charge for Choice customers.  The interim
order is expected to reduce the level of Choice sales volumes.
Assuming no further changes to the current electric Customer
Choice program, we expect to continue losing margins and volumes in
2004. Partially offsetting the impact of lost margins in 2003, we recorded
regulatory assets of $68 million representing an estimate of stranded costs
that we believe are recoverable under Michigan legislation. Based on the MPSC’s
July 2003 order, we do not believe that any of the stranded costs in years
prior to 2003 are recoverable. There are a number of variables and estimates
that impact the level of recoverable stranded costs, including weather, sales
mix and wholesale prices. As a result, our estimate of stranded costs could
increase or decrease. The actual amount of stranded costs to be recovered will
ultimately be determined by the MPSC.

Detroit Edison addressed numerous issues with the electric Customer Choice
program, including stranded costs, in its June 2003 rate filing and is also
pursuing a legislative solution. Under the legislative solution, we are
proposing to limit Customer Choice program participation to customers whose
electric demand is 1 MW or greater. The continued delay in addressing the
structural problems of the electric Customer Choice program and the timely and
full recovery of stranded costs, unfavorably impacts earnings and cash flow.
See Note 4 for a further discussion of the electric Customer Choice
program and the MPSC interim rate order.

Electric and Gas Rate Plans

– In 2000, Michigan legislation froze electric
rates for all residential, commercial and industrial customers through 2003.
The legislation also prevented rate increases or capped rates for residential
customers through 2005, and for small commercial and industrial customers
through 2004. The rate freeze and caps apply to base rates as well as rates
designed to recover fuel and purchased power costs. Historically, these costs
have been a pass-through under the power supply cost recovery (PSCR) mechanism.

In June 2003, Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC for: 1) an
increase in retail electric rates of $427 million annually, 2) the resumption
of the PSCR mechanism, and 3) the recovery of net stranded and other costs as
permitted under Michigan legislation. Detroit Edison received an interim order
in this rate case authorizing an increase in rates of
$248 million annually.  As a result of rate caps and other
factors, the interim rate increase
is only designed to increase revenues by $71 million in 2004
(Note 4).  A final order is expected in the third quarter of 2004.
The rate increase is effective for each customer class upon the expiration of the
applicable rate cap period. The rate request is designed to more accurately
reflect, among other things, significantly higher cost of service levels that
Detroit Edison has
experienced over the past few years.

The recovery of net stranded costs, electric Customer Choice implementation
costs and other costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes, laws and
governmental actions are covered under Michigan legislation. However, the MPSC
has not approved a final mechanism to recover such costs, and this has
negatively affected our cash flow. As part of its rate filing, Detroit Edison
has requested authorization to implement a 5-year surcharge to recover these
costs. The MPSC deferred addressing this item until a final rate
order is issued.

In September 2003, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for an increase
in service and distribution charges for its gas sales and transportation
customers totaling $194 million annually. The rate increase would be MichCon’s
first since 1992, and is designed to recover significantly higher operating
costs. MichCon expects an interim order in this case in mid-2004, with a final
order by January 2005.

Operating Costs

– During 2003, we experienced double-digit increases in
regulated operation and maintenance costs. The increases were driven by higher
costs associated with pension and health care benefits, uncollectable accounts
receivable and customer service initiatives. To address this issue of rising
costs, we implemented several cost savings initiatives that partially offset
these increases. Some of the initiatives were structural in nature, whereas
others were temporary. Examples of these initiatives included a hiring freeze,
a pause on discretionary spending and overtime restrictions. Additionally, we



reduced employee compensation costs, property and other taxes as well as
interest costs through debt refinancings.

Synthetic Fuel Operations

- We operate nine synthetic fuel production plants at
eight locations. Interests in two of the nine plants were sold in 2002,
interests in three other plants were sold in November 2003, and additional
interests were sold in January 2004 in two of the plants sold in 2003. We
continue to wholly own the remaining four plants, but intend to sell interests
in all such plants in 2004. Synfuel facilities chemically change coal,
including waste and marginal coal, into a synthetic fuel as determined under
applicable IRS rules. Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code provides tax
credits for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal.
In addition to meeting various qualifying conditions, a taxpayer must have
sufficient taxable income to earn the Section 29 credits.

Our 2003 earnings were unfavorably affected by our inability to sell interests
in synfuel plants until late 2003. The IRS suspended the issuance of private
letter rulings (PLRs) relating to synthetic fuel projects in May 2003, pending
its review of issues concerning chemical change, which is the basis for earning
Section 29 tax credits. As a result of the IRS suspension, we were unable to
complete the pending sale of interests in our synfuel projects. In addition, we
experienced lower taxable earnings due to milder weather and continued cost and
margin pressures. The temporary delay in selling interests in the synfuel
projects, coupled with the lower taxable earnings, resulted in our capacity to
generate more credits than we could utilize. These factors caused us to reduce
our synthetic fuel production by approximately one-half in June 2003 to
optimize the tax credits generated from these facilities. We began
implementing a series of initiatives, including the monetization of
in-the-money gas swap derivative contracts, to improve cash flow and increase
taxable income thereby allowing us to more fully utilize our Section 29 tax
credits.

In October 2003, the IRS concluded its assessment of the chemical change
process involved in synfuel production and resumed issuing PLRs. The IRS
determined that the test procedures and results used by taxpayers were
scientifically valid if the procedures were applied in a consistent and
unbiased manner. The conclusion of the IRS assessment allowed us to complete
the sale of interests in additional facilities and increase synfuel production
levels for the balance of 2003.

Non-regulated Growth

– During 2003, we continued to experience growth in our
non-regulated businesses with income reaching $199 million compared to $168
million in 2002. The significant
improvement reflects increased contributions from our Energy Services segment
due to higher synfuel production, partially offset by the impact of certain
coke battery-related Section 29 tax credits expiring in 2002. Additionally,
non-regulated growth in 2003 is attributable to increased margins in our Energy
Marketing & Trading segment. We also realized gains in 2003 from the sale of
our 16% interest in the Portland Natural Gas Transmission System, an interstate
pipeline company, and the settlement of a tolling contract at one of our
merchant generating facilities.

Although DTE Energy’s overall earnings were down 18% in 2003, our cash from
operations totaling $950 million was comparable to the prior year despite a
$222 million cash contribution to our pension plan. Operating cash flow
reflects our successful initiative in 2003 to conserve cash, including better
working capital management. This initiative coupled with $233 million in lower
capital expenditures and over $750 million from selling
non-strategic and other assets,
resulted in a lower debt to total capital ratio and a healthier balance sheet.

Outlook

- We are facing many challenges in 2004 to maintain earnings and cash
flow levels, while protecting a strong balance sheet. Our financial
performance over the short term will be dependent on preserving healthy
electric and gas utilities, monetizing our synthetic fuel projects and
continuing to grow our non-regulated businesses in a prudent manner.

Remedying the structural issues of the electric Customer Choice program in
Michigan is a key priority for the organization. These issues must be
corrected to prevent the continued migration of customers to the Choice program
based on false market signals. The potential implications to remaining
customers over the longer term could be significantly higher electricity rates.



The timing and ultimate amount of
final rate relief granted in the current electric
and gas rate cases will affect customer service levels and our financial
performance. Cash flow and earnings from our utilities will remain under
pressure until the regulatory uncertainties are resolved. However, we remain
focused on good cash management and a healthy balance sheet.

We are aggressively pursuing the sales of interests in all of our remaining
synthetic fuel projects in 2004. These sales, in addition to previously
completed sales, are expected to provide a $200 million to $300 million boost
to our cash flow in 2004. The availability of qualified buyers and the timing
of these sales will impact this financial outcome. In addition, we are
continuing to grow our non-regulated businesses in areas such as waste coal
technologies, coal bed methane production and on-site energy project
development. Due to the regulatory uncertainties over the short term, we
remain disciplined and conservative in our pursuit of incremental growth
investments.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We had income of $521 million in 2003, or $3.09 per diluted share, compared to
income of $632 million, or $3.83 per diluted share in 2002 and income of $332
million, or $2.16 per diluted share in 2001. The comparability of earnings was
impacted by the sale of our transmission business, International Transmission
Company (ITC), and the adoption of new accounting rules as subsequently
discussed. Upon selling ITC in February 2003, we classified this business as a
discontinued operation. Excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative
effect of accounting changes, our earnings from continuing operations in 2003
were $480 million, or $2.85 per diluted share, compared to earnings of $586
million, or $3.55 per diluted share in 2002 and earnings of $309 million, or
$2.01 per diluted share in 2001. The following sections provide a detailed
discussion of our segments, operating performance and future outlook.

Segment Performance & Outlook

- We operate our businesses through three
strategic business units (Energy Resources, Energy Distribution and Energy
Gas). Each business unit has regulated and non-regulated operations. The
balance of our business consists of Corporate & Other. Based on this
structure, we set strategic goals, allocate resources and evaluate performance. This
results in the following reportable segments.



(1)

Includes Corporate & Other.



ENERGY RESOURCES

Power Generation

The power generation plants of Detroit Edison comprise our regulated power
generation business. Detroit Edison’s numerous fossil plants, its
hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant generate electricity.
The generated electricity, supplemented with purchased power, is sold
principally throughout Michigan and the Midwest to residential, commercial,
industrial and wholesale customers.

Factors impacting income:

Power Generation earnings decreased $6 million in
2003 and increased $102 million in 2002, compared to the prior year. As
subsequently discussed, these results primarily reflect changes in gross
margins, increased operation and maintenance expenses and the recording of
higher regulatory deferrals, which lowered depreciation and amortization
expenses.

Merger and restructuring charges associated with the 2001 MCN Energy
acquisition also impacted the comparability of results. These charges
represent costs associated with systems integration, relocation, legal,
accounting and consulting services, as well as costs associated with a work
force reduction plan. The plan included early retirement incentives and
voluntary separation agreements for employees in overlapping corporate support
areas.

Gross margins

in 2003 declined $135 million due primarily to decreased cooling
demand resulting from mild summer weather, lost margins from customers choosing
to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the electric Customer Choice
program and lost margins from the August 2003 blackout. Weather in 2003 was 38%
milder than 2002 resulting in lost margins of $114 million. Detroit Edison lost
16% of retail sales in 2003 and 6% of such sales in 2002 as a result of
customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the
electric Customer Choice program. We estimate that we lost
$120 million of margins in 2003 under the electric Customer Choice program, an
increase of $70 million over 2002. Lost Choice margins that we believe are
recoverable under Michigan legislation are recorded as regulatory assets and
therefore reduced depreciation and amortization expense as subsequently
discussed. Gross margins benefited from a $.64 per MWh (4%) decline in fuel
and purchased power costs reflecting the use of a more favorable power supply
mix. The favorable mix is due to lower purchases, which is driven by lost
sales under the electric Customer Choice program.

Gross margins in 2002 improved $106 million due primarily to significantly
lower fuel and purchased power costs, partially offset by reduced operating
revenues. The reduction in fuel and purchased power costs was driven by a
$39.08 per MWh (50%) reduction in average purchased power prices from 2001
levels. The decline in operating revenues is attributable to commercial,
industrial and wholesale customers. Commercial and industrial revenues were
lower due to a full year’s impact of a 5% legislatively mandated rate reduction
for customers that began in April 2001. Additionally, revenues from these
retail customers were affected by customers switching to alternative suppliers
under the electric Customer Choice program. Revenues from wholesale customers
were reduced, reflecting lower power prices. Partially offsetting these revenue
reductions was the impact of weather, resulting in a 10% increase in cooling
demand during 2002.

Represents fuel costs associated with power plants.

(2)

Includes amounts associated with hedging activities.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased $2 million in 2003 and $55 million
in 2002. Operation and maintenance expenses in 2003 were affected by $5 million
in costs associated with the August 2003 blackout (Note 4) and a $69 million
increase in employee pension and health care benefit costs, due to recent
financial market performance, lower discount rates and increased health care
trend rates. Partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the DTE
Operating System, our company-wide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies as
well as enhance operating performance. The DTE Operating System involves the
application of tools and operating practices, which have resulted in inventory
reductions and improvements in technology systems, among other enhancements.
Operation and maintenance expenses in 2003 also benefited from $23 million in
sales of emissions credits and lower employee incentive costs.

Operation and maintenance expenses in 2002 reflect $18 million in higher
employee pension and health care benefit costs and $43 million in expenses
associated with maintaining our generation fleet. The 2002
increase also includes a $5 million increase in allocations for corporate
support services, as well as $11 million to fund the low income and energy
efficiency fund. The funding of the low income and energy efficiency program
was required under Michigan legislation and is recovered in current sales
rates.

Depreciation and amortization

expense decreased $107 million in 2003 and $54
million in 2002. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is
attributable to the income effect of recording regulatory assets totaling $126
million in 2003 and $41 million in 2002 representing the deferral of net
stranded and other costs we believe are recoverable under Public Act 141. The
decline in 2002 also reflects the extension of the amortization period from
seven years to 14 years for certain regulatory assets that were securitized in
2001. See Note 4 – Regulatory Matters. Partially offsetting these declines was
increased depreciation associated with generation-related capital expenditures.

Other income and deductions

declined $40 million in 2003 and increased $5
million in 2002. The reduction in 2003 is attributable to lower interest
expense and increased interest income. Interest expense reflects lower
borrowing levels and rates, and interest income includes the accrual of
carrying charges on environmental-related regulatory assets.

Outlook

– Future operating results are expected to vary as a result of external
factors such as regulatory proceedings, new legislation, changes in market
prices of power, changes in economic conditions and the levels of customer
participation in the electric Customer Choice program.

As previously discussed, we expect to continue losing retail sales and margins
in future years under the electric Customer Choice program until the inequities
associated with this program are addressed. We will accrue as regulatory assets
our unrecovered generation-related fixed costs due to electric Customer Choice
that we believe are recoverable under Michigan legislation. We have addressed
the issue of stranded costs in our June 2003 electric rate filing and are also
pursuing a legislative solution. Additionally, we requested an increase in
retail electric rates of $427 million annually to recover higher operating
costs and the resumption of the PSCR mechanism.  In February 2004,
the MPSC authorized an interim base rate increase of
$248 million annually. The actual timing and level of recovering stranded and operating costs
will ultimately be determined by the MPSC or legislation. We cannot predict
the outcome of these matters. See Note 4 – Regulatory Matters.



Energy Services

Energy Services is comprised of Coal-Based Fuels, On-Site Energy Projects and
Merchant Generation. Coal-Based Fuels operations include producing synthetic
fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery
plants. Both processes generate tax credits under Section 29 of the Internal
Revenue Code. On-Site Energy Projects include pulverized coal injection, power
generation, steam production, chilled water production, wastewater treatment
and compressed air supply. Merchant Generation owns and operates four
gas-fired peaking electric generating plants and develops and acquires gas and
coal-fired generation.

Factors impacting income

: Energy Services earnings increased $17 million in
2003 and $67 million in 2002, compared to the prior year. As subsequently
discussed, these results primarily reflect increases in synfuel production,
varying levels of Section 29 tax credits, a one-time contract gain and a
write-off of an uncollectable account.

Operating revenues

increased $284 million in 2003 and $198 million in 2002
reflecting higher synfuel production due to a greater number of operating
synfuel plants. All nine of our synfuel plants were operational throughout
2003, whereas only five were operational throughout 2002 and only two in 2001.
As discussed in Note 13, the growth in synfuel revenues was tempered by our
decision to reduce synfuel production by approximately one-half in June 2003.
Also impacting the 2003 comparison was reduced generation revenue due to the
settlement of a tolling contract at one of our generating facilities.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased $258 million in 2003 and $308
million in 2002, reflecting costs associated with the higher levels of synfuel
production. Operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed
operating revenues and therefore generate operating losses, which are more than
offset by the resulting Section 29 tax credits. Operation and maintenance
expense in 2003 also includes a $10 million net of tax write-off for an
uncollectable receivable associated with a large customer bankruptcy.
Partially offsetting these increases was a one-time $19 million net of tax gain
from the settlement of the tolling contract.

Other income and deductions

increased $16 million in 2003 and $87 million in
2002. The increases reflect our minority partners’ share of operating losses
associated with synfuel operations. The sale of interests in our synfuel
facilities during 2002 and 2003 resulted in our minority partners being
allocated a larger percentage of such losses.

Income tax

benefits decreased $19 million in 2003 and increased $95 million in
2002. Income tax variations reflect changes in taxable earnings and the level
of Section 29 tax credits from our synfuel and coke battery facilities. Tax
credits from our synfuel operations increased in each of the last two years due
to higher synfuel production. Tax credits from our coke battery production
reflect the expiration of such credits at two of our three plants in 2002.
Additionally, tax credits were impacted by our interest in one
of the coke battery projects being reduced from 95% to 5% in 2002, consistent
with the original purchase and sale agreement.

Outlook

- A significant portion of Energy Services’ earnings consist of Section
29 tax credits. Synfuel-related tax credits expire in 2007. Tax credits for
two of our three coke batteries expired at the end of 2002, and the third
expires in 2007. We are aggressively pursuing opportunities to sell interests
in all of our synfuel plants in 2004. The level of tax credits generated in
future periods will be affected by the timing and number of synfuel projects
sold. When we sell an interest in a synfuel facility, we recognize the gain
from such sale under the installment method of accounting. Gain recognition is
dependent on the synfuel production qualifying for Section 29 tax credits. In
substance, we are receiving installment gains and reduced operating losses in
exchange for tax credits. Sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to
accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable income base.

There is a bill currently before the United States Congress that includes
provisions extending or reinstating tax credits for various types of energy
facilities and processes, including coke batteries, Antrim shale gas, coal bed
methane, refined coal and landfill gas. We are unable to predict the outcome of
the legislative process.

Energy Services will continue leveraging its extensive energy-related operating
experience and project management capability to develop and grow the on-site
energy business. We continue to explore growth opportunities that will not
require significant initial capital investment. We are currently negotiating an
on-site energy business arrangement with a major manufacturer in the Midwest.

Power prices over the past few years have been low due, in part, to the current
excess capacity in the generation industry. Additionally, the generation
tolling agreement that was settled in 2003 was at above market rates. As a
result of these factors, we expect lower revenues and earnings from our
merchant generation business in 2004.

Energy Marketing & Trading

Energy Marketing & Trading consists of the electric and gas marketing and
trading operations of DTE Energy Trading and CoEnergy. DTE Energy Trading
focuses on physical power marketing and



structured transactions, as well as the
enhancement of returns from DTE Energy’s power plants. CoEnergy focuses on
physical gas marketing and the optimization of DTE Energy’s owned and
contracted natural gas pipelines and gas storage capacity. To this end, both
companies enter into derivative financial instruments as part of their
strategies, including forwards, futures, swaps and option contracts. The
derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the mark to market
method, which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and losses
from changes in the fair value of the derivatives.

Factors impacting income

: Energy Marketing & Trading’s earnings increased $20
million in 2003, of which $18 million was attributable to DTE Energy Trading
and $2 million to CoEnergy. Earnings for 2002 decreased $19 million, consisting
of a $6 million improvement at DTE Energy Trading, which was more than offset
by a $25 million reduction at CoEnergy.

DTE Energy Trading’s earnings improvement in 2003 and 2002 was due mainly to
margins associated with short-term physical trading and origination activities.
The improvement was partially offset by reduced proprietary trading profits.
Proprietary trading represents derivative activity transacted with the intent
of capturing profits on forward price movements.

1)

Realized margins include the settlement of all derivative and
non-derivative contracts, as well as the amortization of deferred assets
and liabilities.

2)

Unrealized margins include mark-to-market gains and losses on derivative
contracts, net of gains and losses reclassified to realized. See “Fair
Value of Contracts” section that follows.

3)

Unrealized – gas in inventory margins represent gains and losses
associated with fair value accounting in 2002 and 2001. CoEnergy changed
its method of accounting for inventory in January 2003 (Note 2).

CoEnergy’s earnings in 2003 and 2002 were driven by varying levels of operating
costs and margins. Operating costs reflect the scale-back of certain retail gas
marketing operations in 2002 as well as lower allocations for corporate support
services in 2003.

Variations in margins reflect: 1) the settling or monetizing of certain
in-the-money derivative contracts in 2003, 2) a change in the method of
accounting for our gas in inventory in January 2003, and 3) volatility related
to the accounting for our production-related gas supply contracts in 2001.

We monetized certain in-the-money derivative contracts in 2003 while
simultaneously entering into replacement at-the-market contracts with various
counterparties. The monetizations were completed in conjunction with
implementing a series of initiatives to improve cash flow as well as our
ability to fully



utilize Section 29 tax credits (Note 13). The monetizations had
the impact of reducing unrealized gains and increasing realized gains by
approximately $136 million, with no significant impact on earnings.

As previously discussed, our derivative financial instruments are accounted for
under the mark to market method, including those derivatives that hedge our
price risk exposure associated with gas in inventory. Through December 2002,
our physical gas in inventory was marked to the current spot price under fair
value accounting rules. Accordingly, mark to market accounting for derivatives,
coupled with fair value accounting for gas in inventory, minimized earnings
mismatches. To comply with new accounting requirements resulting from the
rescission of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98-10,

“Accounting
for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities

,” we
changed to the average cost method for our gas inventories, effective January
2003 (Note 2). As a result, CoEnergy experienced earnings volatility as it
recorded unrealized gains in 2002 and unrealized losses in 2001 from fair
valuing its inventory, whereas no such gains or losses were recorded in 2003.

The comparability of CoEnergy’s results was also affected by using different
market prices for fair valuing its derivatives and fair valuing its gas in
inventory, before the accounting change. Derivatives are marked to market
against the forward curve, whereas gas in inventory was marked to the current
spot price. The difference in accounting for derivatives and gas in storage
resulted in earnings volatility in 2002 and 2001 when price changes in the spot
month did not correspond with those in the forward market. Gas in storage in
December 2002 was priced at a spot market rate of $5.10 Mcf, compared to $2.77
per Mcf in December 2001 and a May 31, 2001, acquisition date rate of $4.10 per
Mcf. Significantly smaller changes in forward prices occurred during these same
periods. As a result, the mark-to-market gains and losses on gas inventory
were only partially offset by mark-to-market losses and gains on the
storage-related derivatives.

CoEnergy receives gas produced from DTE Energy’s Gas Production operations,
which is used to meet its commitments under long-term contracts with
cogeneration customers. The gas produced does not qualify for mark-to-market
accounting. CoEnergy recorded a gain in 2001 totaling approximately $50
million, net of taxes, primarily attributable to marking to market sales
contracts with power generation customers without recording an offsetting loss
from marking to market the production-related gas supply. In December 2001,
CoEnergy entered into hedge transactions that substantially mitigate the
earnings volatility related to the gas contracts with power generation
customers

.

Outlook

– Energy Marketing & Trading will seek to manage its business in a
manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business
segments. Gas storage and transportation capacity enhances our ability to
provide reliable and custom-tailored bundled services to large-volume end users
and utilities. This capacity, coupled with the synergies from DTE Energy’s
other businesses, positions the segment to add value.

Significant portions of the Energy Marketing & Trading portfolio are
economically hedged, and include financial instruments, gas inventory, as well
as owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and storage assets. These
financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the gas inventory,
pipelines and storage assets are not considered derivatives for accounting
purposes. As a result, Energy Marketing & Trading will experience earnings
volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying
non-derivative contracts and assets.

A significant portion of the earnings volatility in this segment is associated
with the natural gas storage cycle, which runs from June to March. Injections
of gas into inventory takes place in the summer and gas is withdrawn in the
winter. DTE Energy’s policy is to hedge the price risk of all purchases for
storage with sales in the “over the counter” and futures markets, eliminating
the price risk for the storage business. As previously discussed, current
accounting rules do allow for the marking to market of forward sales, but do
not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory. This results
in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim periods, but even
out by the end of the storage cycle.



In February 2004, we terminated a long-term gas exchange agreement and modified
our future purchase commitments under a related transportation agreement with
an interstate pipeline company, effective March 31, 2004. The
agreements were at rates that were not reflective of current
market conditions and had been fair valued under generally accepted
accounting principles. In 2002, the fair value of the transportation
agreement was frozen when it no longer met the definition of a
derivative as a result of FERC Order 637.  The fair value amounts
were being amortized to income over the life of the related
agreements, representing a net liability of  approximately $75 million as
of December 31, 2003. We are currently negotiating new
agreements with the interstate pipeline company.  We will record an
appropriate adjustment to the liability after all related agreements
have been finalized.

Non-regulated - Other

Our other non-regulated businesses are comprised of our Coal Services and
Biomass units. Coal Services provides fuel, transportation and equipment
management services. We specialize in minimizing energy production costs and
maximizing reliability of supply for energy-intensive customers. Additionally,
we participate in coal trading and coal-to-power tolling
transactions, as well as sales of excess emissions credits. Coal Services has formed a subsidiary, DTE PepTec Inc., that uses
proprietary technology to produce high quality coal products from fine coal
slurries that are typically discarded from coal mining operations. Biomass
develops, owns and operates landfill recovery systems in the U.S. Gas produced
from these landfill sites qualifies for Section 29 tax credits.

Factors impacting income

: Earnings declined $9 million in 2003 and increased $1
million in 2002. The 2003 decline reflects reduced marketing and tolling
income as well as an increase in operating costs associated with ramping up the
DTE PepTec business. Our first waste coal facility in Ohio became operational
in late-2003.

and plan to aggressively pursue expansion opportunities. We expect to open 3 to
5 operating sites in 2004. Biomass currently has 31 operating sites and other
projects under development. Section 29 tax credits related to Biomass
operations expire in 2007.

Factors impacting income

: Power Distribution earnings decreased $94 million
during 2003 and increased $14 million in 2002, compared to the prior year. As
subsequently discussed, these results primarily reflect changes in operating
revenues and increased operation and maintenance expenses. Merger and
restructuring charges associated with the 2001 MCN Energy acquisition also
impacted the comparability of results.

Operating revenues

declined $96 million in 2003 primarily due to mild summer
weather and the impact of slower economic conditions affecting commercial and
industrial sales. Operating revenues increased $87 million in 2002 reflecting
higher residential sales attributable to greater cooling demand.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased $75 million in 2003 and $138
million in 2002 reflecting higher costs associated with weather-related power
outages, employee benefits, uncollectable accounts receivables, allocations for
corporate support services, and customer service initiatives to improve
customer satisfaction. Restoration costs associated with three catastrophic
storms in 2003 and the August 2003 blackout totaled $76 million. We experienced
an April ice storm, resulting in more than 400,000 customers losing power, a
July windstorm, affecting over 190,000 customers, a November windstorm,
affecting 160,000 customers, and the August blackout, affecting all 2.1 million
of our customers. This compares with $49 million in costs in 2002 related to
two catastrophic storms, as well as heat-related maintenance expenses due to
prolonged periods of above normal summer temperatures and the related stress
placed on our distribution system.

Employee pension and health care benefit costs increased $26 million in 2003
and $12 million in 2002 due to recent financial market performance, lower
discount rates and increased health care trend rates. Uncollectable accounts
expense increased $17 million in 2003 and decreased $1 million in 2002
reflecting higher past due amounts attributable to current economic conditions.
Additionally, results for



2003 also reflect costs associated with customer service initiatives and a net
of tax loss of $14 million on the sale of our non-strategic steam heating
business (Note 3). Partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the
DTE Operating System, as previously discussed, and lower employee incentive
costs.

Taxes other than income

decreased $17 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002.
The decline in 2003 is due to lower Michigan Single Business Taxes, reflecting
reduced taxable earnings, and lower property taxes.

Outlook

– Operating results are expected to vary as a result of external
factors such as weather, changes in economic conditions and the severity and
frequency of storms. Economic conditions and prior billing issues have resulted
in an increase in past due receivables. We believe our allowance for doubtful
accounts is based on reasonable estimates. However, failure to make continued
progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect
operating results. As a result, we have organized a focused effort to address
the credit and collection issues.

We experienced numerous catastrophic storms over the past few years. The
effect of the storms on annual earnings ranged up to $70 million
and was partially offset by storm insurance. We were
unable to obtain storm insurance at economical rates in 2004 and as a result,
we do not anticipate having insurance coverage at levels that would
significantly offset unplanned expenses from ice storms, tornadoes, or high
winds that damage our distribution infrastructure.

As previously mentioned, Detroit Edison filed a rate case in June 2003 to
address future operating costs and other issues. Detroit Edison
received an interim order in this rate case in February 2004.  See Note 4 – Regulatory
Matters.

Non-Regulated

Non-regulated Energy Distribution operations consist of DTE Energy Technologies
which markets and distributes distributed generation products, provides
application engineering, and monitors and manages generation system operations.

Factors impacting income

: Non-regulated losses decreased $1 million in 2003 and
increased $6 million in 2002. The slight improvement in 2003 is due primarily
to increased sales and cost reductions.

Outlook

– Although installed capacity for DTE Energy Technologies is
increasing, the growth in this business is below our expectations. Accordingly,
we have taken actions to reduce our expenses and streamline our operations,
including exiting from some non-strategic business lines and activities. DTE
Energy Technologies expects to continue participating in the emerging
distributed generation market.



ENERGY GAS

Gas Distribution

Gas Distribution operations include gas distribution services primarily
provided by MichCon, our gas utility that purchases, stores, distributes and
sells natural gas to 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial
customers located throughout Michigan.

* Reflects the operations of MichCon from the May 31, 2001 acquisition date.

n/m - not meaningful

Factors impacting income:

Gas Distribution’s earnings declined $37 million in
2003 and increased $104 million in 2002, compared to the prior year. As
subsequently discussed, results in 2003 primarily reflect a decline in gross
margins and increased operation and maintenance expenses. The significant
improvement in 2002 reflects a full year of operations of MichCon, which was
acquired in conjunction with the MCN Energy merger in May 2001. In contrast to
2001, the 2002 results include the January through April period when demand for
natural gas is at its highest. Merger and restructuring charges associated with
the merger also impacted the comparability. The pro-forma impact of the MCN
Energy acquisition on DTE Energy is discussed in Note 3 – Acquisitions and
Dispositions.

Gross margins

declined $6 million in 2003 reflecting a $26.5 million reserve
for the potential disallowance in gas costs pursuant to a March 2003 MPSC order
in MichCon’s 2002 GCR plan case (Note 4). The impact of the reserve was
significantly offset by increased sales due to colder winter weather in early
2003.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased $74 million in 2003 reflecting
higher costs associated with employee benefits, uncollectable accounts
receivables, allocations for corporate support services, and customer service
initiatives. Employee pension and health care benefit costs increased $47
million in 2003 and uncollectable accounts expense increased $17 million in
2003 reflecting economic conditions and higher gas prices. Partially offsetting
these increases were benefits from the DTE Operating System, as previously
discussed, and lower employee incentive costs.

Income taxes

in 2003 were impacted by lower earnings and favorably affected by
an increase in the amortization of tax benefits previously deferred in
accordance with MPSC regulations.

Outlook

– Operating results are expected to vary as a result of external
factors such as regulatory proceedings, weather and changes in economic
conditions. Higher gas prices, current economic conditions
and prior billing issues have resulted in an increase in past due receivables.
We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable
estimates. However, failure to make continued progress in collecting our past
due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results. As previously
discussed, we are focused on addressing the credit and collection issues.

The MPSC issued several orders that continue the gas Customer Choice program on
a permanent basis. Since MichCon continues to transport and deliver the gas to
the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on
gas sales, customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on
MichCon’s earnings. As of December 2003, approximately 129,000 customers were
participating in the gas Customer Choice program, compared with approximately
190,000 customers as of December 2002.

As a result of the continued increase in operating costs, MichCon filed a rate
case in September 2003 to increase rates by $194 million annually to address
future operating costs and other issues. See Note 4 – Regulatory Matters.



Non-regulated

Non-regulated operations include the Gas Production business and the Gas
Storage, Pipelines & Processing business. Our Gas Production business produces
gas from proven reserves in northern Michigan and sells the gas to the Energy
Marketing & Trading segment. Gas Storage, Pipelines & Processing has a
partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline, seven carbon
dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field, as well as lease
rights to another natural gas storage field. The assets of these businesses
are well integrated with other DTE Energy entities.

Factors impacting income

: Earnings increased $3 million in 2003 and $15 million
in 2002. The 2003 earnings improvement primarily reflects the gain from the
sale of our 16% pipeline interest in the Portland Natural Gas Transmission
System. The 2002 results reflect a full year of operations of the our
non-regulated gas businesses that were acquired in conjunction with the MCN
Energy acquisition in May 2001.

Outlook

– We expect to further develop our gas production properties in
northern Michigan and our pipelines, processing and storage assets to support
other DTE Energy businesses. In October 2003, we acquired an additional 15%
interest in the Vector Pipeline, bringing our total ownership interest to 40%.
The purchase of the additional interest in the Vector Pipeline complements our
existing gas distribution and storage facilities in Michigan. Additionally, we
expect to continue to invest in opportunities in the coal bed methane business
to leverage our production, coal and low cost operating capabilities.

CORPORATE & OTHER

Corporate & Other includes the administrative and general expenses of various
corporate support functions such as accounting, legal and information
technology. As these functions essentially support the entire company, they
are allocated to the various segments based on services utilized and therefore
can vary from year to year. Additionally, Corporate & Other holds certain
non-regulated debt and investments, including assets held for sale and in
emerging energy technologies.

Factors impacting income

: Corporate & Other’s losses were basically flat in
2003 and 2002. The 2003 results were affected by a $15 million cash
contribution to the DTE Energy Foundation that was funded with proceeds
received from the sale of ITC (Note 3). The impact of the contribution was
offset by lower interest costs. Results in 2002 reflect higher interest
expense resulting from increased debt and a full year’s impact of corporate
debt assumed in the MCN Energy acquisition. Additionally, 2002 results reflect
a reserve of $11 million (pre-tax) for the possible loss associated with direct
loans to and the guarantee of debt of a technology investment. Losses in 2001
include the amortization of goodwill associated with the MCN Energy
acquisition.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - ITC

In December 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Trimaran Capital Partners, LLC to sell ITC
for $610 million in cash. The sale closed on February 28, 2003 following
approval of the transaction by the FERC and resolution of all other
contingencies and generated a net of tax gain of $63 million.

Prior to May 31, 2001, Detroit Edison owned and operated the transmission
assets of ITC, which were vertically integrated with its other operations.
Accordingly, revenues, expenses and cash flows associated with these
transmission assets were bundled with Detroit Edison’s Power Distribution
operations. Significant changes in regulation over the past few years required
Detroit Edison to cede operating control of its transmission assets to an
independent system operator or to sell its transmission assets. In response
to these new requirements we formed ITC and transferred our transmission assets
to this wholly-owned subsidiary with the intent of divesting ITC. Effective
June 1, 2001, the transmission assets of ITC were transferred to DTE Corporate
and its revenues, expenses and cash flows were separately monitored
to measure its financial and operating performance. Accordingly, the
presentation of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of
operations reflects the results of ITC after May 31, 2001. The



financial results of the transmission business prior to June 1, 2001 are
included as part of the Power Distribution segment.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES

As required by generally accepted accounting principles, on January 1, 2003, we
adopted new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations and energy
trading activities. The cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting
rules reduced 2003 earnings by $27 million. Additionally, on January 1, 2001
we adopted a new accounting rule for derivative instruments and the cumulative
effect of adopting this new rule increased 2001 earnings by $3 million. See
Note 2 for further discussion.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

(1)  2001 includes $1.75 billion of securitization bonds and $1.35 billion
of debt issued to acquire MCN Energy.



Operating Activities

We use cash derived from operating activities to maintain and expand our
electric and gas utilities and to grow our non-regulated businesses. In
addition, we use cash from operations to retire long-term debt and pay
dividends. A majority of the company’s operating cash flow is provided by the
two regulated utilities, which are significantly influenced by factors such as
weather, customer choice sales loss, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions
and operating costs. This part of our business has recently been under
considerable financial pressure given that we have not had a rate increase in
over 10 years, coupled with higher operating costs and increased regulatory
deferrals. While these regulatory deferrals at Detroit Edison have served to
mitigate some of the earnings pressures as a result of these influencing
factors, the corresponding cash flows have been deferred. Our non-regulated
businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise and reflect a
range of operating profiles. These vary from our synthetic fuels business,
which will provide substantial cash flow over the next 5 years, to new
start-ups, such as our coal bed methane or waste coal recovery businesses,
which are growing and will require modest investments beyond their cash
generation capabilities.

During 2003, our consolidated net cash from operating activities was $950
million, reflecting a decrease of $46 million from 2002 levels. The decrease in
2003 operating cash flow was attributable to declines in regulated net income,
after adjusting for noncash items (depreciation, depletion, amortization,
deferred taxes and gains), reflecting the impacts of weather, lost electric
Customer Choice margins and higher operating costs. Partially offsetting these
declines were lower working capital and other requirements reflecting a
company-wide initiative focused on improving cash flow. The initiative included
better inventory management, improved accounts receivable collections, the
selling of interests in our synfuel facilities, the monetization of
in-the-money derivatives and replacing margin deposits with letters of credit.
The improvement in working capital was achieved despite a $222 million
contribution to our pension plan.

Operating cash flow in 2002 of $996 million was $185 million higher than 2001
levels, largely attributable to the full year’s impact of the MCN Energy
acquisition, which was completed in May 2001. Lower working capital and other
requirements were partially offset by a decline in net income, after adjusting
for noncash items. Working capital reflects the seasonal requirements of the
gas business where cash is used in the second half of the year to finance
increases in gas inventories and customer accounts receivable. Additionally,
past due accounts receivable balances increased due to higher gas prices,
economic conditions and conversion issues with the new combined utility billing
system.

Outlook

— We expect cash flow from operations to increase over the long-term,
but to remain relatively the same in 2004 as 2003. Cash flow improvements from
utility rate increases and synfuel sales will be offset by higher cash
requirements primarily within our energy marketing and trading business.

Operating cash flow from our utilities is expected to increase in 2004, but
will be affected by the level of sales migration under the electric Customer
Choice program and the ability of the MPSC within the regulatory processes to
put in place a Choice program that has sound economic fundamentals. In
addition, the Choice program’s impact will also be determined by the success of
the company in addressing certain structural flaws within the legislative
process. While the Choice program’s shortfalls may be structurally addressed
within these two processes, the use of regulatory deferrals by the MPSC might
affect the cash benefits of addressing the existing choice program being
realized in 2004.

Another factor affecting regulated cash flows is the degree and timing of rate
relief within the electric and gas rate cases. Based on the interim order
issued by the MPSC on February 20, 2004, approximately $71 million of
additional revenues should be realized within the 2004 calendar year. Due to
the structure of the interim rate order, we will not realize the full benefits
of interim and final rate relief until 2006 when customer rate caps expire.

Improvements in cash flow from our utilities are also expected from better
managing our working capital requirements, including the continued focus of
reducing past due accounts receivables. Our emphasis in these businesses will
continue to be centered around cash generation and conservation given the
regulatory uncertainties.

Cash flow from our synfuel
business, including proceeds from the sale of interests in related
facilities, should shift from a
net cash loss of $195 million in 2003 to positive cash flow of $135 million in
2004 and $355 million in 2005. The expected improvements are driven by the sale
of interests in synfuel facilities, increased production and a higher cash
value per credit. We will also benefit from lower taxes paid as we use our tax
credit carry forward position.

Our other operating
non-regulated businesses will provide minimal cash from operations
in 2004 and grow modestly in future years. Remaining start-up
businesses such as coal bed methane, waste coal recovery and
distributed generation will have
cash losses over the next couple of years while they are being further
developed. Certain of the cash initiatives previously discussed, resulted in
accelerating the receipt of cash in 2003 which will have the impact of lowering
cash flow in 2004.



Investing Activities

Cash inflows associated with
investing activities are partially generated from the sale of assets
and utilized to invest in our utilities and non-regulated businesses. In any
given year, we will look to harvest cash from under performing or non-strategic
assets. Capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain
our generation and distribution infrastructure and comply with environmental
regulations. We have incurred higher utility capital expenditures over the past
several years to comply with new air quality standards. Capital spending
within our non-regulated businesses should be viewed in two categories. For
businesses currently operating, expenditures are for ongoing maintenance and
some expansion. The balance of non-regulated spending is for growth, which we
manage very carefully. We look to make investments that meet strict criteria in
terms of strategy, management skills, risks and returns. All new investments
are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted
basis. We have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make
investments unless they meet our criteria. For new business lines, we invest
tentatively based on research and analysis. Based on a limited investment, we
evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results.
In any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the
underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any
potential impact on our credit ratings.

During 2003, we had net cash from investing activities of $10 million compared
to cash used of $1.1 billion in 2002. The significant improvement was due to
proceeds totaling $758 million from the sale of ITC, interests in three synfuel
projects and non-strategic assets that were acquired as part of the MCN Energy
acquisition. Additionally, regulated and non-regulated plant expenditures
decreased significantly in 2003. Lower regulated expenditures of $115 million
were associated with air quality regulations that require reductions in
nitrogen oxide levels. Non-regulated expenditures declined by $118 million and
the comparison reflects costs incurred in 2002 associated with four synfuel
facilities that became fully operational.

During 2002, the investing activity cash flow comparison improved by $1.2
billion and was impacted by the cash portion of the MCN Energy acquisition in
2001. The 2002 improvement was also due to lower non-regulated capital
expenditures, partially offset by reduced proceeds from the sale of assets.

Outlook

— Our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments
and expenditures for existing businesses in 2004 ranging from $750 million to
$1.0 billion. Our utilities plan to spend higher amounts of capital, but
actual spending levels will be matched to available cash flows. Until our two
rate cases are resolved, we will hold utility capital spending at 2003 levels.

Capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in 2004 primarily
as a result of our DTE2 initiative, as subsequently discussed. This project will require capital
investments in 2004 and 2005 for new computer systems. Non-regulated capital
spending will approximate $80 million to $100 million annually for the next several years.
Capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will be constrained
in 2004 due to the pending rate cases, electric Customer Choice issues and
rating agency concerns about these businesses. Accordingly, we are seeking to
grow the business by making small investments in areas like coal bed methane
and waste coal recovery. Utilizing this approach allows us to determine
quarterly our spending levels, which will be based on capital and credit
constraints.

Longer term, once the electric Choice issues are resolved and utility rate
increases are fully phased in, we anticipate capital availability to return to
historical levels. After the utilities return to financial health, we will
continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined
fashion. If we can find opportunities that meet our strategy and financial and
risk criteria we will look to make investments. If we have the available cash
flow and can’t find value creating investments, we intend to return that
capital to shareholders and pay down debt.

We believe that we will have sufficient capital resources, both internal and
external, to balance anticipated capital requirements.

Financing Activities

We continually evaluate our leverage targets to ensure that they are consistent
with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating. Since our
merger with MCN Energy in 2001, we have been successful in reducing our
leverage. Given the present environment in our industry, the increase in
regulatory assets, and the nature of the electric Customer Choice program and
other uncertainties, we may need to further lower our leverage in the future.

Our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and
variable interest rates and maturity. We have completed a number of
refinancings over the past several years with the effect of extending the
average maturity of our long-term debt. The extension of the average maturity
was accomplished at interest rates which have lowered our debt costs.
Variable rate debt is principally in the form of outstanding commercial paper.
Additionally, we have interest rate derivatives that effectively converts fixed
rate debt to variable rate debt. Variable rate debt represents approximately
10% of our total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2003.



Our net cash related to financing activities decreased $1.0 billion in 2003 and
decreased $1.7 billion in 2002. The 2003 change was due to higher redemptions
of long-term debt and lower proceeds from issuances of new debt and common
stock. In 2002, proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock were used
for the redemption of higher cost debt and to reduce short-term borrowings.
The 2001 issuance of $1.75 billion of securitization bonds and the 2001
issuance of $1.35 billion of long-term debt to finance the acquisition of MCN
Energy impacts the comparison between 2002 and 2001. In 2001, proceeds from the
issuance of securitization bonds and other Detroit Edison and MichCon debt were
used to repay higher priced debt and repurchase our common stock. Details of
2003 financing activities follows (Note 9):

•

MichCon issued $200 million of 5.7% senior notes due in March 2033.
The proceeds were used for debt redemption and general corporate
purposes.

•

DTE Energy issued $400 million of 6-3/8% senior notes due in April
2033. In conjunction with this issuance, DTE Energy exchanged $100
million principal amount of existing debt due April 2008. The proceeds
were used for debt redemptions and general corporate purposes.

•

DTE Energy redeemed $100 million principal amount of 6.17%
Remarketed Notes due in 2038.

•

Detroit Edison issued $49 million of 5.5% tax exempt bonds due in
2030. The proceeds were used to redeem $49 million of 6.55% tax-exempt
bonds due 2024.

Outlook

— Our goal is to maintain a healthy balance sheet. We intend on
maintaining a high investment grade credit rating and maintaining leverage in
the 50% to 55% range (excluding certain debt, principally securitization debt).

We expect to contribute $170 million of DTE Energy common stock to our pension
plan in the first quarter of 2004. This contribution will modestly improve our
leverage. Additionally, we expect to continue the practice of issuing new DTE
Energy shares for our dividend reinvestment plan. We believe this is a
cost-effective means of raising new equity.

Debt maturing in 2004 totals approximately $500 million and we called $100
million of Trust preferred- linked securities in late 2003. In addition, there
are outstanding debt instruments that are likely to be economic to redeem and
refund with new debt in 2004. The Company expects to continue to take
advantage of low historical long-term interest rates and issue new securities
with a longer life than the securities maturing or called.

As of December 31, 2003, DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon have effective
shelf registrations with the SEC that allow for the issuance of up to an
additional $1.3 billion of debt and $850 million of equity securities. We have
authorization from the DTE Energy Board to repurchase approximately 9.5 million
shares of our common stock. No shares have been repurchased under this
authorization since early 2002. Future repurchases are not presently
contemplated and will depend upon future market conditions and the Company’s
financial condition.

In October 2003, DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon entered into separate
revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $1.3 billion.
These facilities support our use of letters of credit and the issuance of
commercial paper. Borrowing available under these revolving credit facilities
totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2003. Our revolving credit facilities
contain customary covenants, including the requirement to maintain a debt to
total capitalization ratio of not more than .65 to 1, and an “earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (EBITDA) to interest ratio of
no less than 2 to 1. As of December 31, 2003, our debt to total capitalization
ratio as computed under the terms of the agreement was .50 to 1 and our EBITDA
to interest ratio was 3.6 to 1. We anticipate having the need and the ability
to renew these credit facilities prior to their expiration at fair and
reasonable market rates as determined at the time of negotiation.

Additionally, Detroit Edison has a $200 million short-term financing agreement
secured by customer accounts receivable of which $100 million was outstanding
as of December 31, 2003. The agreement contains certain covenants related to
the delinquency of accounts receivable. Detroit Edison is currently in
compliance with these covenants.

Credit Ratings

The uncertainty in Michigan’s regulatory environment and the impact of the
electric Customer Choice program has resulted in various independent credit
rating agencies reviewing our credit rating. An unfavorable change in our
rating could restrict our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates
and increase our borrowing costs. We have issued guarantees for the benefit of
various non-regulated subsidiaries. In the event that our credit rating is
downgraded two levels and would therefore be below investment grade, certain of
these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at
approximately $290 million at December 31, 2003. Additionally, our trading
business could be required to cease operations and our access to the short-term
commercial paper market would be restricted or eliminated. While we currently
do not anticipate such a downgrade, we cannot predict the outcome of current or
future reviews. The following table shows our credit rating as determined by
three nationally respected credit rating agencies. All ratings are considered
investment grade and affect the value of the related securities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

There are estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements
that require considerable judgment. Such estimates relate to regulation, risk
management and trading activities, Section 29 tax credits, goodwill, pension
and post retirement costs, and the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Regulation

A significant portion of our business is subject to regulation. Detroit Edison
and MichCon currently meet the criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 71, “

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation

.” Application of this standard results in differences in the
application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and
non-regulated businesses. SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of regulatory
assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as
revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses. Future regulatory changes or
changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the
application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of our businesses. If we were to
discontinue the application of SFAS No. 71 on all our operations, we estimate
that the extraordinary loss would be as follows:

)

(1)

Excludes securitized regulatory assets

Management believes that currently available facts support the continued
application of SFAS No. 71 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are
recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment (Note 4).

Risk Management and Trading Activities

All derivatives are recorded at fair
value and shown as “Assets or liabilities
from risk management and trading activities” in the consolidated statement of
financial position. Risk management activities are accounted for in accordance
with SFAS No. 133, “

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,”

as amended. Through December 2002, trading activities were
accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98-10, “

Accounting for Energy
Trading and Risk Management Activities

.” Effective January 2003, trading
activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133.
See Note 2 - New
Accounting Pronouncements.

The offsetting entry to “Assets or liabilities from risk management and trading
activities” is to other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the use
of the derivative, how it is designated and if it qualifies for hedge
accounting. The fair values of derivative contracts were adjusted each
reporting period for changes using market sources such as:

•

published exchange traded market data

•

prices from external sources

•

price based on valuation models

Market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts.
Derivative contracts are only marked to market to the extent that markets are
considered highly liquid where objective, transparent prices can be obtained.
Unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions that do not
meet this criterion.



Section 29 Tax Credits

We have generated Section 29 tax credits from our synfuel, coke battery,
biomass and gas production operations. All of our synthetic fuel facilities
have received favorable private letter rulings from the IRS with respect to
their operations. All Section 29 tax credits taken after 1997 are subject to
audit by the IRS, and if we fail to prevail through the administrative and
legal process, there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously
taken Section 29 tax credits. Four of our synfuel facilities are under audit
by the IRS for 2001 and are expected to be completed in 2004. Our portion of
tax credits generated was $241 million in 2003 as compared to $250 million in
2002 and $165 million in 2001. Outside firms assist us in assuring we operate
in accordance with our private letter rulings and within the parameters of the
law, as well as calculating the value of tax credits.

Goodwill

Certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business
combinations (Note 1). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,

” each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to
perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the value of goodwill may be impaired. In order to perform these
impairment tests, we must determine the reporting unit’s fair value using
valuation techniques, which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be
generated by the reporting unit. These cash flow estimates involve judgments
based on a broad range of information and historical results. To the extent
estimated cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be required
to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our
earnings. Based on our 2003 goodwill impairment test, we determined that no
impairment existed. As of December 31, 2003, our goodwill totaled $2.1 billion.

Pension and Postretirement Costs

Our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a
number of factors, including rates of return on plan assets, the discount rate,
the rate of increase in health care costs and the amount and timing of plan
sponsor contributions.

We had pension costs for qualified pension plans of $47 million in 2003,
pension income of $9 million in 2002 and pension costs of $159 million in 2001.
Postretirement benefits costs for all plans was $118 million in 2003, $70
million in 2002 and $104 million in 2001. Pension and postretirement benefits
cost is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an
expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets of 9.0% at December 31,
2003. In developing our expected long-term rate of return assumption, we
evaluated input from our consultants, including their review of asset class
risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions. Projected
returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond markets. Our
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset
allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 65% in equity
markets, 28% in fixed income markets, and 7% invested in other assets. Because
of market volatility, we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance
our portfolio when considered appropriate. Given market conditions we believe
that 9.0% is a reasonable long-term rate of return on our plan assets. We will
continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of
return, at least annually.

We base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a
market-related valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This
market-related valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic
manner over a three-year period. Because of this method, the future value of
assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. We
have unrecognized net losses due to the recent unfavorable performance of the
financial markets. As of December 31, 2003, we had $7 million of cumulative
losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related
value of assets.

The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and
postretirement benefit obligations is based on a review of bonds that receive
one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating



agency. The
discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 6.75% at December 31,
2002 to 6.25% at December 31, 2003. Due to recent financial market performance,
lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates, we estimate that
our 2004 pension costs will approximate $100 million compared to
$54 million in
2003 and our 2004 postretirement benefit costs will approximate $135 million
compared to $118 million in 2003. We have made modifications to the pension
and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher
costs. Future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on
future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various
other factors related to plan design.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets by 1.0% would
have increased our 2003 qualified pension costs by approximately $22 million.
Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by 1.0% would
have increased our pension costs for 2003 by approximately $11 million.
Lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by 1.0% would have decreased
our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2003 by approximately
$16 million.

The market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been
affected by declines in the financial markets in recent years. The value of our
plan assets decreased from $2.8 billion at December 31, 2001, to $2.4 billion
at December 31, 2002. The value at December 31, 2003 increased to $2.9 billion.
The investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to
recognize at December 31, 2002, an additional minimum pension liability of $855
million, an intangible asset of $57 million and an entry to other comprehensive
loss (shareholders’ equity) of $518 million, net of tax. As of December 31,
2003, we recognized a decrease in minimum pension liability of $75 million, a
decrease in intangible assets of $13 million and a decrease in other
comprehensive loss (a component of shareholders’ equity) of $647 million ($421
million after tax). The additional minimum pension liability and related
accounting entries will be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if
the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit
obligations. The recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net
income or cash flow.

Pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements will
increase in future years without a substantial recovery in the financial
markets. We made a $35 million cash contribution to the pension plan in 2002
and a $222 million cash contribution in 2003. We anticipate making an
approximate $170 million contribution to our pension plan in the form of DTE
Energy common stock in the first quarter of 2004. We also contributed $33 million to the
postretirement plans in 2002. We did not contribute to the postretirement plans
in 2003, and made a $40 million contribution in January 2004.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
Act was signed into law. This Act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least
actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law. We have not
quantified the impact of the Act, if any, on our plan.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding
the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, economic conditions,
age of receivables and other information. With the implementation of a new
integrated utility billing system in late 2001, we encountered billing issues
as is
typical with large-scale system implementations. While we have resolved the
primary billing issues, we may encounter difficulty in collecting past due
receivables. Higher customer bills due to increased gas prices, the lack of
adequate levels of assistance for low-income customers and economic conditions
have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables. As a result of
these factors, our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2002 and 2003.
We believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable
estimates. However, failure to make continued progress in collecting our past
due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow.



ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Protecting the environment, as well as correcting past environmental damage,
continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators. Legislation and (or)
rulemaking could further impact the electric utility industry including Detroit
Edison. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Michigan Department
of Environmental Quality have aggressive programs to clean-up contaminated
property.

The EPA ozone transport regulations and final
new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will
continue to impact us. Detroit Edison has spent approximately $560 million
through December 2003 and estimates that it will spend approximately $40 million in 2004 and incur up to an additional
$1.2 billion of future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years
to satisfy both existing and proposed new control requirements. Recovery of
costs to be incurred through December 2004 is included in our June 2003
electric rate case. In addition, we maintain the option to securitize these
costs after the completion of our current regulatory proceedings.

The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several major electric
utilities citing violations of the Clean Air Act, asserting that older,
coal-fired power plants have been modified in ways that would require them to
comply with the more restrictive “new source” provisions of the Clean Air Act.
Detroit Edison received and responded to information requests from the EPA on
this subject. The EPA has not initiated proceedings against Detroit Edison.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio Eastern
Division issued a decision in August 2003 finding Ohio Edison Company in
violation of the new source provisions of the Clean Air Act. If the Court’s
decision is upheld, the electric utility industry could be required to invest
substantial amounts in pollution control equipment. During the same month,
however, a district court in a different division rendered a conflicting
decision on the matter. On August 27, 2003, the EPA released new rules,
effective December 26, 2003, allowing repair, replacement or upgrade of
production equipment without triggering source requirement controls if the cost
of the parts and repairs do not exceed 20% of the replacement value of the
equipment being upgraded. Such repairs will be considered routine maintenance,
however any changes in emissions would be subject to existing pollution permit
limits and other state and federal programs for pollutants. Several states and
environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and on December
24, 2003, were granted a stay until the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit
hears the arguments on the case. We cannot predict the future impact of this
issue upon Detroit Edison.

DTE ENERGY OPERATING SYSTEM AND DTE2

During 2002, we adopted The DTE Energy Operating System, which is a philosophy
that involves the application of tools and operating practices that have
resulted in inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems, among
other enhancements. Operation and maintenance expenses benefited from our
company-wide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies and enhance operating
performance. We expect continued cost containment efforts and process
improvements.

In 2003, we began the implementation of DTE2, a company-wide initiative to
improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems
including, finance, human resources, supply chain and work management. We
expect to incrementally spend approximately $150 million to $175 million over the next 3 to 4
years to implement these new processes and systems. We expect the benefits to
outweigh this investment primarily from lower costs, faster business cycles,
repeatable and optimized processes, enhanced internal controls, improvements in
inventory management and reductions in system support costs.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Commodity Price Risk

DTE Energy has commodity price risk arising from market price fluctuations in
conjunction with the anticipated purchase of electricity to meet its
obligations during periods of peak demand. We also are exposed to the risk of
market price fluctuations on gas sale and purchase contracts, gas production
and gas inventories. To limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations, we
have entered into a series of electricity and gas futures, forwards, option and
swap contracts. See Note 15 – Financial and Other Derivative Instruments for
further discussion.

Interest Rate Risk

DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of
debt and preferred securities. In order to manage interest costs, we use
treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements. Our exposure to interest
rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial
paper rates and London Inter-Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR).

Foreign Currency Risk

DTE Energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price
fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts. These contracts are
denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of
power as well as for long-term transportation capacity. To limit our exposure
to foreign currency fluctuations, we have entered into a series of currency
forward contracts through 2008.

Summary of Sensitivity Analysis

We performed a sensitivity analysis calculating the impact of changes in fair
values utilizing applicable forward commodity rates or changes in interest

Bankruptcies

We purchase and sell electricity, gas, coal and coke from and to numerous
companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy and retail industries. A
number of customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We have negotiated or are currently involved in
negotiations with each of the companies, or their successor companies, that
have filed for bankruptcy protection. We regularly review contingent matters
relating to purchase and sale contracts and record provisions for amounts
considered probable of loss. We believe our accrued amounts are adequate for
probable losses. The final resolution of these matters is not expected to have
a material effect on our financial statements in the period they are resolved.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

DTE Energy Company

We have audited the consolidated statement of financial position of DTE Energy
Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in
shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15. These financial statements
and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of DTE Energy Company and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements of the Company taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with the required adoption of certain new
accounting principles, in 2003 the
Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations,
energy trading contracts and gas inventories; in 2002 the Company changed its
method of accounting for goodwill and energy trading contracts; and in 2001
the Company changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Corporate Structure

DTE Energy is an exempt holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 and owns the following businesses:

•

Detroit Edison Company (Detroit Edison), an electric utility
engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution and sale of electric
energy to 2.1 million customers in southeast Michigan;

•

Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon), a natural gas utility
engaged in the purchase, storage, transmission and distribution and
sale of natural gas to 1.2 million customers throughout areas of
Michigan; and

•

Other non-regulated subsidiaries engaged in energy marketing and
trading, energy services and various other electricity, coal and gas
related businesses.

Detroit Edison and MichCon are regulated by the Michigan Public Service
Commission (MPSC). The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates
certain activities of Detroit Edison’s business as well as various other
aspects of businesses under DTE Energy. In addition, we are regulated by other
federal and state regulatory agencies including the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others.

References in this report to “we”, “us”, “our” or “Company” are to DTE Energy
and its subsidiaries, collectively.

Principles of Consolidation

We consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in
which we have controlling influence. Non-majority owned investments are
accounted for using the equity method when the company is able to influence the
operating policies of the investee. Non-majority owned investments include
investments in limited liability companies, partnerships or joint ventures.
When we do not influence the operating policies of an investee, the cost method
is used. We eliminate all intercompany balances and transactions.

For entities that are considered variable interest entities we apply the
provisions of FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46-R,

“Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.”

For a detailed discussion
of FIN 46-R see Note 2 – New Accounting Pronouncements.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared using
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
accounting principles require us to use estimates and assumptions that impact
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ
from our estimates.

We reclassified certain prior year balances to match the current year’s
financial statement presentation.

Revenues

Revenues from the sale and delivery of electricity, and the sale, delivery and
storage of natural gas are recognized as services are provided. Detroit Edison
and MichCon record revenues for electric and gas provided but unbilled at the
end of each month. Under agreement with the MPSC, Detroit Edison was not
allowed to raise rates through 2003. Through December 2001, MichCon’s rates
included a component for cost



of gas sold that was fixed at $2.95 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). In
2002, MichCon reinstated the gas cost recovery (GCR) mechanism that recovers
the prudent and reasonable cost of gas sold subject to annual proceedings
before the MPSC.

Non-regulated revenues are recognized
as services are provided and products are delivered.

Since 2002, the FASB has issued significant accounting guidance that governs
energy trading revenue recognition and classification. See Note 2 - New
Accounting Pronouncements for additional detail.

Comprehensive Income

We comply with SFAS No. 130, “

Reporting Comprehensive Income

,” that established
standards for reporting comprehensive income. SFAS No. 130 defines
comprehensive income as the change in common shareholders’ equity during a
period from transactions and events from non-owner sources, including net
income. As shown in the following table, amounts recorded to other
comprehensive income include unrealized derivative gains and losses under SFAS
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities under
SFAS No. 115, “

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

,” and minimum pension liabilities as prescribed by SFAS No. 87,
“

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,”

at
December 31, 2003. The minimum pension liability was
reclassified to a regulatory asset during 2003 (Note 4).

Inventories

We value fuel inventory and materials and supplies at average cost.

Gas inventory at MichCon is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method. At December 31, 2003, the replacement cost of gas remaining in storage
exceeded the $117 million LIFO cost by $251 million. At December 31, 2002, the
replacement cost exceeded the $55 million LIFO cost by $187 million. During
2001, MichCon liquidated 2.1 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of prior years’ LIFO
layers at an average cost of $0.39 per Mcf. MichCon’s average gas purchase
rate in 2001 was $2.83 per Mcf higher than the average LIFO liquidation rate.
Applying LIFO cost in valuing the liquidation, as opposed to using the average
purchase rate, decreased 2001 cost of gas by $5.8 million and increased
earnings by $3.8 million, net of taxes.

Through December 2002, the Energy Marketing & Trading segment used the fair
value method to price gas inventories. To comply with the accounting
requirements resulting from the rescission of Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) Issue No. 98-10, “

Accounting
for Energy Trading Activities and Risk Management Activities

,” the Energy
Marketing & Trading segment changed to the average cost method for its gas
inventories, effective January 2003.



Property, Retirement and Maintenance, and Depreciation and Depletion

Summary of property by classification as of December 31:

(1)

Represents the operations of ITC that were sold in February 2003.

Property is stated at cost and includes construction-related labor, materials
and overheads. The cost of properties retired, less
salvage, at Detroit Edison and MichCon are charged to accumulated depreciation.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred,
except for Fermi 2. Approximately $37 million of expenses related to the
anticipated Fermi 2 refueling outage scheduled for 2004 are being accrued on a
pro-rata basis over an 18-month period that began in May 2003. We have utilized
the



accrue-in-advance policy for nuclear refueling outage costs since the Fermi
2 plant was placed
in service in 1988. This method also matches the regulatory recovery of these
costs in rates set by the MPSC.

We base depreciation provisions for utility property at Detroit Edison and
MichCon on straight-line and units of production rates approved by the MPSC.
The composite depreciation rate for Detroit Edison was 3.4 % in 2003, 2002 and
2001. The composite depreciation rate for MichCon was 3.5%, 3.6% and 3.9% in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The average estimated useful life for each class of property, plant and
equipment as of December 31, 2003 follows:

Estimated Useful Lives in Years

Electric



—

Gas

N/A



(1)

The electric transmission assets were sold in
February 2003.

Non-regulated property is depreciated over its estimated useful life using
straight-line, declining-balance or units-of-production methods.

We credit depreciation, depletion and amortization expense when we establish
regulatory assets for stranded costs related to the electric Customer Choice
program and deferred environmental expenditures.

Gas Production

We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for investments in gas
properties. Under this method of accounting, all property acquisition costs
and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred,
pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an
exploratory well has not found proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well
are expensed. The costs of development wells are capitalized, whether
productive or nonproductive. Geological and geophysical costs on exploratory
prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are
expensed as incurred. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that
capitalized costs of unproved properties, on a property-by-property basis, are
considered not to be realizable. An impairment loss is recorded if the net
capitalized costs of proved gas properties exceed the aggregate related
undiscounted future net revenues. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of
proved gas properties are determined using the units-of-production method.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets that we own are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected future
cash flows generated by the asset, an impairment loss is recognized resulting
in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell.

Software Costs

We capitalize the costs associated with computer software we develop or obtain
for use in our business. We amortize computer software costs on a straight-line
basis over expected periods of benefit once the installed software is ready for
its intended use.



Excise and Sales Taxes

We record the billing of excise and sales taxes as receivables with an
offsetting payable to the applicable taxing authority, with no impact on the
statement of operations.

Deferred Debt Costs

The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized
over the life of each debt issue. In accordance with MPSC regulations
applicable to our electric and gas utilities, the unamortized discount, premium
and expense related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized over the
life of the replacement issue. Discount, premium and expense on early
redemptions of debt associated with non-regulated operations are charged to
earnings.

Insured and Uninsured Risks

We have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for
various types of risks. Our insurance policies cover risk of loss from various
events, including catastrophic storms, general liability, workers’
compensation, auto liability, property and directors and officers liability.

Under our risk management policy, we self-insure portions of certain risks up
to specified limits, depending on the type of exposure. We
periodically review our insurance coverages and during 2003, we
reviewed our process for estimating
and recognizing reserves for self-insured risks. As a result of this review,
we revised the process for estimating liabilities under our self-insured layers
to include an actuarially determined estimate of “incurred but not reported”
(IBNR) claims. This revision resulted in the recording of an additional
liability and reduced earnings in 2003 by approximately $15 million, primarily
related to general liability and workers’ compensation exposures. We intend to
have an actuarially determined estimate of our IBNR liability prepared annually
and will adjust the related reserve as appropriate.

Stock-Based Compensation

We have a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described in Note
15. The plan permits the awarding of various stock awards, including options,
restricted stock and performance shares. We account for stock awards under the
plan under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

.” No
compensation cost related to stock options is reflected in net income, as all
options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. The recognition provisions under
SFAS No. 123, “

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,” require the recording
of compensation expense for stock options equal to their fair value at date of
grant as determined using an option pricing model. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had recorded
compensation expense for options granted under the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123.



(1)

Expense determined using a Black-Scholes based option pricing model.

Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

We generally classify investments in debt
and equity securities as either trading or available-for-sale and
have recorded such investments at market value with unrealized gains
or losses included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations or in
other comprehensive income or loss, respectively. Changes in the fair
value of certain other investments are recorded as adjustments to
regulatory assets or liabilities.

Gains from Sale of Interest in
Synthetic Fuel Facilities

When we sell an interest in a synfuel
facility, we recognize the gain from such sale under the installment
method of accounting. Gain recognition is dependent on the synfuel
production qualifying for Section 29 tax credits. Accordingly, we
have deferred gains totaling $311 million and $161 million as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Investment in Plug Power

In 1997, we invested in Plug Power Inc., a company that designs and develops
on-site electric fuel cell power generation systems. Since Plug Power is
considered a development stage company, generally accepted accounting
principles required us to record gains and losses from Plug Power stock
issuances as an adjustment to equity. Prior to November 2003 we accounted for
our investment in Plug Power Inc. under the equity method of accounting. We did
not participate in Plug Power’s secondary stock offering in November 2003 and
as of December 31, 2003 we own approximately 19% of Plug Power’s common stock.
We have determined that we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over the operating or financial policies of Plug Power. Accordingly,
we began prospective application of the cost method of accounting for our
investment in Plug Power, effective November 2003. We record our
investment at market value and account for unrealized gains and
losses in other comprehensive income or loss.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

We consider investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash contractually designated for debt service is classified
as restricted cash.

NOTE 2 – NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133, “

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,

” as amended. SFAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging
activities. SFAS No. 133 required that as of the date of initial
adoption, the difference between the fair value of derivative
instruments and the previous carrying amount of those derivatives be
reported in net income or other comprehensive income as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative
effect of adopting SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 was an increase in
net income of $3 million and an increase in other comprehensive loss
of $42 million.

Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 149, “

Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

The statement amends and
clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging
activities. Our financial statements were not impacted by the adoption of SFAS
No. 149.

In August 2003, the EITF released Issue No. 03-11, which provides guidance on
whether to report realized gains or losses on a gross or net basis on
physically settled derivative contracts not held for trading purposes. The new
guidance was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2003 and had an immaterial
effect on our financial statements.

See Note 12 – Financial and Other Derivative Instruments for additional
information.



Energy Trading Contracts

Under EITF Issue No. 98-10, companies were
required to use mark-to-market accounting for contracts utilized in energy
trading activities. EITF Issue No. 98-10 was rescinded in October 2002, and
energy trading contracts must now be reviewed to determine if they meet the
definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 requires all derivatives to
be recognized in the statement of financial position as either assets or
liabilities measured at their fair value and sets forth conditions in which a
derivative instrument may be designated and recognized as a hedge. SFAS No.
133 also requires that changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized
in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Energy trading
contracts not meeting the



definition of a derivative are accounted for under
settlement
accounting, effective October 25, 2002 for new contracts and effective January
1, 2003 for existing contracts. Derivative contracts are only marked to market
to the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective,
transparent prices can be obtained. Unrealized gains and losses are fully
reserved for transactions that do not meet this criteria.

Additionally, inventory utilized in energy trading activities accounted for
under the fair value method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Research
Bulletin (ARB) No. 43 is no longer permitted. DTE Energy’s Energy Marketing &
Trading segment uses gas inventory in its trading operations and switched to
the average cost inventory accounting method in January 2003.

Effective January 1, 2003, we
applied EITF Issue 02-03 which rescinded EITF Issue 98-10. As a
result of discontinuing the application of EITF Issue No. 98-10 to
energy contracts and ARB No. 43 to gas inventory, we recorded a cumulative effect
of accounting change that reduced net income for the first quarter of 2003 by
$16 million (net of taxes of $9 million.)

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142. “

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,

” which addresses the financial accounting and reporting
standards for the acquisition of intangible assets outside of a business
combination and for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their
acquisition. This accounting standard requires that goodwill be separately
disclosed from other intangible assets in the balance sheet. Additionally under
this statement, goodwill is no longer amortized, but must be reviewed at least
annually for impairment. The provisions of this accounting standard also
required the completion of a transitional impairment test within six months of
adoption, with any impairment treated as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principal. We completed the annual goodwill impairment test and have
determined that no impairment exists.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we discontinued the amortization of goodwill
effective January 1, 2002. A reconciliation of previously reported 2001 net
income and earnings per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of
goodwill amortization follows:

In connection with the
adoption of SFAS No. 142, we also reassessed the useful
lives and the classification of identifiable intangible assets and determined
that they continue to be appropriate. Our intangible assets consist primarily
of software and are subject to amortization. Intangible assets amortization
expense was $40 million in 2003, $46 million in 2002 and $48 million in 2001.
There were no material acquisitions of intangible assets during 2003 and 2002.
The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets at
December 31, 2003 were $537 million and $303 million, respectively. The gross
carrying amount and accumulated amortization of
intangible assets at December 31, 2002 were $526 million and $317 million,
respectively. Amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to be $40
million annually for 2004 through 2008.

Asset Retirement
Obligations

On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, “

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,

” which requires the fair value of an asset retirement obligation
be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. It applies to legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets resulting from
the acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal operation of a
long-lived asset. When a new liability is recorded, an entity will capitalize
the costs of the liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related
long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present
value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life
of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity settles the
obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement.

We have identified a legal retirement obligation for the decommissioning costs
for our Fermi 1 and 2 nuclear plants. To a lesser extent, we have retirement
obligations for our synthetic fuel operations, gas production facilities,
asphalt plant, gas gathering facilities and various other operations. As to
regulated operations, we believe that adoption of SFAS No. 143 results
primarily in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset retirement
costs that we are currently recovering in rates and are deferring such
differences under SFAS No. 71, “

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation.

”

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, we recorded a plant
asset of $306 million with offsetting accumulated depreciation of $106 million,
a retirement obligation liability of $815 million and reversed previously
recognized obligations of $377 million, principally nuclear decommissioning
liabilities. We also recorded a cumulative effect amount related to regulated
operations as a regulatory asset of $221 million, and a cumulative effect
charge against earnings of $11 million (net of tax of $6 million) for 2003.

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset
retirement obligation is incurred, such as assets with an indeterminate life,
the liability is to be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can
be made. Generally, distribution assets have an indeterminate life, retirement
cash flows cannot be determined and there is a low probability of retirement,
therefore no liability has been recorded for these assets.

The pro forma effect on earnings had SFAS No. 143 been adopted for all periods
presented would decrease reported net income and basic and diluted earnings per
share as follows:

The pro forma effect of the asset retirement obligation had SFAS No. 143 been
adopted for all periods presented would increase reported liabilities by $815
million and $807 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

SFAS No. 143 also requires the quantification of the estimated cost of removal
obligations, arising from other than legal obligations, which have been accrued
through depreciation charges. At December 31, 2002, we reclassified
approximately $729 million of previously accrued asset removal
costs related to
our regulated operations, which had been previously netted against accumulated
depreciation, to an asset removal cost liability. At December 31, 2003, we
reclassified approximately $655 million of these accrued asset removal
obligations to regulatory liabilities.

Exit and Disposal Activities

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 146, “

Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

,” which requires that the liability
for costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when
incurred, rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan.
The adoption of this statement had no impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

In January 2003, FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46,

“Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,”

was issued and requires an
investor with a majority of the variable interests (primary beneficiary) in a
variable interest entity to consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of
operations of the entity. A variable interest entity is an entity in which the
equity investors do not have controlling interests, the equity investment at
risk is insufficient to finance the entity’s activities without receiving
additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or equity
investors do not share proportionally in gains or losses. FIN 46 was
applicable (i) immediately for all variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003; or (ii) in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003 for variable interest entities created before February 1,
2003.

In October 2003, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FIN 46-6, which allowed for
the deferral of the effective date for applying the provisions of
Interpretation No. 46 for all interests in variable interest entities created
before February 1, 2003, until the end of the first interim or annual period
ending after December 15, 2003.

In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46-Revised (FIN 46-R) which clarified and
replaced FIN 46. FIN 46-R again deferred the adoption of its provisions until
periods ending after March 15, 2004, however, application is required for
periods ended after December 15, 2003 for public entities that have interests
in special-purpose entities. FIN 46-R defines special purpose entities as any
entity whose activities are primarily related to securitizations or other forms
of asset-backed financings or single-lessee leasing arrangements. In addition,
FIN 46-R provides for further scope exceptions, including an exception for
entities that are deemed to be a business, provided certain conditions are met.

As of December 31, 2003, we have determined that we have interests in various
entities that would not qualify for the deferral provisions of FIN 46-R. As a
result, we have adopted the provisions of FIN 46-R as of December 31, 2003
relative to our interests in these special purpose entities and have deferred
the application of the provisions of FIN 46-R until March 31, 2004 for all
other entities.

We have interests in two trusts formed for the sole purpose of issuing
preferred securities and lending the gross proceeds to their respective parent
companies. As of December 31, 2003, the trusts have $280 million of preferred
securities outstanding. The sole assets of the trusts are debentures of their
parent companies with terms similar to those of the related preferred
securities.

Prior to the application of FIN 46-R, we consolidated these trusts. However,
pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46-R, these trusts meet the definition of
special purpose entities. Upon applying the provisions of FIN 46-R to these
trusts as of December 31, 2003, we have determined that the trusts are variable
interest entities, as our common equity investment is considered not at risk,
and we are not the primary beneficiaries of the trusts. Accordingly, we have
deconsolidated these trusts as of December 31, 2003
and our balance sheet was


modified to reflect Investments in Unconsolidated
Subsidiaries (included in Other Investments) of approximately $9 million,
representing our common equity investment in the trusts, and Long-Term Debt of
approximately $289 million, representing our obligations related to the trust
debentures.

As permitted under FIN 46-R, we have deconsolidated the trusts in prior periods
to be consistent with the current year’s presentation. The adoption of FIN
46-R did not result in a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment.

We continue to evaluate all of our cost and equity method investments created
prior to February 1, 2003 to determine whether those entities are variable
interest entities that require consolidation. The effects of adopting the
provisions of FIN 46-R to those entities are not expected to have a material
effect on our financial statements.

Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity

Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 150,

“Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity,”

which establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities
certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have
characteristics of both liabilities and equity.

The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not impact our financial statements.

NOTE 3 – ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

Acquisition of MCN Energy

On May 31, 2001, DTE Energy completed the acquisition of MCN Energy by
acquiring all of its outstanding shares of common stock for a combination of
cash and shares of our common stock. See Note 8 – Common Stock and Earnings
per Share for additional information. We purchased the outstanding common
stock of MCN Energy for $2.3 billion and assumed existing MCN Energy debt and
preferred securities of $1.5 billion.

We accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method and accordingly
allocated the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
net assets acquired totaled $2.1 billion and was classified as goodwill. We
began amortizing goodwill on June 1, 2001, on a straight-line basis using a
40-year life. In accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1,
2002, the amortization of goodwill ceased, and goodwill is tested for
impairment on an annual basis.

The following unaudited pro forma summary presents information about the
company as if the acquisition became effective at the beginning of the
respective periods. The pro forma amounts include the impact of certain
adjustments, such as acquiring the operations of MCN Energy and issuing $1.35
billion of debt and 29 million shares of common stock to finance the
acquisition. The pro forma amounts do not reflect the benefits from synergies
we are receiving as a result of combining operations, do not reflect the actual
results that would have occurred had the companies been combined for the
periods presented, and are not necessarily indicative of future results of
operations of the combined companies.

We incurred merger related costs of $27 million ($18 million, net of tax) and
restructuring costs of $241 million ($157 million, net of tax) during 2001.
Merger related charges represent systems integration, relocation, legal,
accounting and consulting costs. Restructuring charges were primarily
associated with a work force reduction plan. The plan included early
retirement incentives and voluntary separation agreements for 1,186 employees,
primarily in overlapping corporate support areas. Approximately $53 million of
the merger and restructuring charges were paid as of December 31, 2001 and
remaining benefit payments have been or will be paid from retirement plans.

Disposition of International Transmission Company – Discontinued Operation

In December 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement with affiliates of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Trimaran Capital Partners, LLC providing for
the sale of ITC for approximately $610 million in cash. The sale closed in
February 2003 following approval of the transaction by the FERC and the
resolution of all other contingencies. The sale generated an after tax gain of $63
million, which was net of transaction costs and the portion of the
gain that was refundable to customers.

The FERC had encouraged integrated electric utilities to transfer operating
control of their transmission facilities to independent operators or sell the
facilities to an independent company. DTE Energy’s decision to sell ITC is
consistent with our strategic view that maximization of shareholder value and
high levels of customer service are best achieved with assets we own, operate
and exercise significant control. As provided in FERC regulations, Detroit
Edison continues to have fair and open access to Michigan’s electric
transmission network. The ITC electric transmission system continues to be
operated by the Midwest Independent System Operator, a regional transmission
operator. ITC received FERC approval to cap transmission rates charged to
Detroit Edison’s customers at current levels until December 31, 2004.
Thereafter, rates are subject to adjustment by the FERC.

SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

”
provides that the results of operations of a component of an entity that has
been disposed of should be reported as a discontinued operation when the
operations and cash flows of the component have been eliminated from the
ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant
continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal
transaction. As a result, we have reported the operations of ITC as a
discontinued operation as shown in the following table:

Prior to May 31, 2001, Detroit Edison owned and operated the transmission
assets of ITC, which were vertically integrated with its other operations.
Accordingly, revenues, expenses and cash flows associated with these
transmission assets were included with the Energy Distribution – Regulated
Power Distribution segment and were not separately identifiable. Effective
June 1, 2001, the transmission assets of ITC were transferred to DTE Corporate
and its revenues, expenses and cash flows were separately monitored to measure
its financial and operating performance. Accordingly, the presentation of
discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations reflects
the results of ITC after May 31, 2001.

ITC had net property of $388 million at December 31, 2002. In conjunction with
the sale of ITC, approximately $44 million of goodwill allocated to this
segment was written off and reduced the net of tax gain.

Disposition of Detroit Edison’s Steam Heating Business

In January 2003, we sold Detroit Edison’s steam heating business to Thermal
Ventures II, LLP. This disposition is consistent with DTE Energy’s strategy of
divestiture of non-strategic assets. Due to the continuing involvement of
Detroit Edison in the steam heating business, including the commitment to
purchase $150 million in steam for resale through 2008, fund certain capital
improvements and guarantee the buyer’s credit facility, we recorded a net of
tax loss of approximately $14 million in 2003. As a result of Detroit Edison’s
continuing involvement, this transaction is not considered a sale for
accounting purposes. The steam heating business had assets of $6 million at
December 31, 2002, and had net losses of $12 million in 2002 and net income of
$3 million in 2001. See Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies.

NOTE 4 - REGULATORY MATTERS

Regulation

Detroit Edison and MichCon are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the
MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to retail rates, recovery of certain
costs, including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets,
conditions of service, accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit Edison
is also regulated by the FERC with respect to financing authorization and
wholesale electric activities.

In 1998, based on MPSC Orders, the Power Generation business of Detroit Edison
started transitioning to market-based rates with the start of a customer choice
program. In compliance with EITF Issue No. 97-4, “

Deregulation of the Pricing
of Electricity

”, we ceased application of SFAS No. 71, “

Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation

”, for the generation business in 1998.
Since that time, there have been significant legislative and regulatory changes
in Michigan that have resulted in our generation business being fully regulated
with cost-based ratemaking.

In June 2000, the Customer Choice and Electric Reliability Act (PA 141) was
enacted into law providing the regulatory framework to maintain cost-based
rates for retail customers and ensuring the recovery of all



amounts of generation-related stranded costs from choice customers.
Subsequent MPSC orders developed a cost-based methodology to determine the
amount of our net stranded costs to be recovered from choice customers. Since
the rates for retail customers and the recovery of net stranded costs that are
set by the regulator recover Detroit Edison’s generation costs and are billed
and recovered from full service and choice customers, the criteria of SFAS No.
71 are satisfied. In addition, we believe we have both the legislative and
regulatory authority to defer regulatory costs and to begin recovery of such
costs starting in 2004 after the PA 141 mandated rate freeze expires. The SEC
had no objection to Detroit Edison resuming application of SFAS No. 71 for its
generation business in the fourth quarter of 2002. Detroit Edison recorded $15
million of additional regulatory assets for the equity component of Allowance
for Funds Used During Construction and costs related to reacquired debt that
was refinanced with lower cost debt. Prior period financial statements were not
restated due to the immaterial effect of retroactively applying SFAS No. 71 to
Detroit Edison’s generation business.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for
certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue and expense in
non-regulated businesses. Continued applicability of SFAS No. 71 requires that
rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and
be charged to and collected from customers. Future regulatory changes or
changes in the competitive environment could result in the company
discontinuing the application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of its businesses
and require the write-off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability
that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management
believes that currently available facts support the continued application of
SFAS No. 71 to Detroit Edison and MichCon.

The following are the balances of the regulatory assets and liabilities at
December 31:



Securitized regulatory assets

— The net book balance of the Fermi 2 nuclear
plant was written off in 1998 and an equivalent regulatory asset was
established. In 2001, the Fermi 2 regulatory asset and certain other regulatory
assets were securitized pursuant to Public Act (PA) 142 and an MPSC Order. A
non-bypassable securitization bond surcharge recovers the securitized
regulatory asset over a fourteen-year period ending in 2015.

Recoverable income taxes related to securitized regulatory assets

— Receivable
for the recovery of income taxes to be paid on the non-bypassable
securitization bond surcharge. A non-bypassable securitization tax surcharge
recovers the income tax.

Recoverable minimum pension liability

— An additional minimum pension liability
was recorded in 2002 and 2003 (Note 14). The traditional rate setting process
allows for the recovery of pension costs as measured by generally
accepted accounting principles.
Accordingly, the minimum pension liability associated with regulated operations
is recoverable.

Asset retirement obligation

— Asset retirement obligations were recorded
pursuant to adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003. These obligations are primarily
for Fermi 2 decommissioning costs that are recovered in rates.

Other recoverable income taxes

— Income taxes receivable from Detroit Edison’s
customers representing the difference in property-related deferred income taxes
payable and amounts previously reflected in Detroit Edison’s rates.

Net stranded costs

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization, the full
recovery of fixed cost deficiency associated with the electric Customer Choice
program. Net stranded costs occur when fixed cost related revenues do not cover
the fixed cost revenue requirements.

Deferred Clean Air Act expenditures

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization,
the recovery of and a return on Clean Air Act expenditures.

Midwest Independent System Operator charges

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC
authorization, the recovery of charges from a regional transmission operator
such as the Midwest Independent System Operator.

Transmission integration costs

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization, the
recovery of transmission integration costs.

Electric Choice implementation costs

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC
authorization, the recoverability of costs incurred associated
with the implementation of the electric Customer Choice program. A deferred
return of 7% is also being accrued on the unrecovered balance.

Enhanced security costs

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization, the
recovery of enhanced homeland security costs for an electric generating
facility.

Unamortized loss on reacquired debt

— The unamortized discount, premium and
expense related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are deferred, amortized and
recovered over the life of the replacement issue.

Deferred environmental costs

— The MPSC approved recovery of costs for
investigation and remediation incurred at former manufactured gas plant sites.

Accrued gas cost recovery

— The amount of under-recovered gas costs incurred by
MichCon recoverable through the GCR mechanism. A deferred return
computed using MichCon’s short-term borrowing rate is also being
accrued on the under-recovered balance.



Asset removal costs

– The amount collected from customers for the funding of
future asset removal activities.

Excess securitization savings

— Savings associated with the 2001 securitization
of Fermi 2 and other costs are refundable to Detroit Edison’s customers.

Customer Refund – 1997 Storm

— The over collection of the 1997 storm costs,
which are refundable to Detroit Edison customers after January 1, 2004.

Refundable income taxes

— Income taxes refundable to MichCon’s customers
representing the difference in property-related deferred income taxes payable
and amounts recognized pursuant to MPSC authorization.

Accrued GCR potential disallowance

— A March 2003 MPSC Order in MichCon’s 2002
GCR plan case required MichCon to reduce revenues in the calculation of its
2002 GCR expense.

Electric Transitional Rate Plan

Rate Request

— In June 2003, Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC
requesting a change in retail electric rates, resumption of the Power Supply
Cost Recovery (PSCR) mechanism, and recovery of net stranded costs. The
application requested a base rate increase for both full service and electric
Customer Choice customers totaling $416 million annually (approximately 12%
increase) in 2006, with a three year phase-in starting in 2004 as the caps on
customer rates expire, as subsequently discussed. Detroit Edison proposed that
the $416 million increase be allocated between full service customers ($265
million) and electric Customer Choice customers ($151 million). In November
2003, Detroit Edison increased its original rate request by $11 million to $427
million. The rate request also seeks a five-year surcharge totaling $109
million from both full service and electric Customer Choice customers to
recover certain deferred regulatory asset balances, including electric Customer
Choice program implementation costs, return on and of clean air investments
made prior to inclusion in base rates and net stranded costs for years prior to
2004. Detroit Edison requested authority to increase rates on an interim basis
by $299 million annually to all customers not subject to a rate cap. PA 141
became effective in June 2000 and contains provisions freezing rates through
2003 and preventing rate increases for residential customers through 2005 and
for small commercial and industrial customers through 2004. Detroit Edison
requested the MPSC act on our interim request in order to be effective January
1, 2004. Concurrent with the issuance of an order for interim rate relief,
Detroit Edison requested reinstatement of the PSCR mechanism. The PSCR
mechanism allows Detroit Edison to recover through rates its fuel and purchased
power expenses. The PSCR was suspended by the MPSC following passage of PA
141. Detroit Edison also proposed that base rates for the customer classes
still subject to rate caps in 2004 and 2005 remain frozen and not be subject to
the PSCR mechanism until the caps expire.

A summary of the total rate increase request follows:

The filing also requests a permanent capital structure based on 50% debt and
50% equity, and a proposed return on equity (ROE) of 11.5%. Detroit Edison is
also proposing a symmetrical ROE sharing mechanism, which will apply to full
service and electric Customer Choice customers whose rates are no longer capped
under PA 141. The sharing proposal would provide that shareholders retain all
earnings within a 1% band above and below the authorized ROE. If the actual
ROE falls



outside of the band, customers would share between 20% and 80% of the excess or
shortfall of earnings, depending on actual ROE. The ROE sharing mechanism
would be effective for the calendar year in which a final order is received in
this case.

As previously discussed, Detroit Edison requested that its PSCR clause remain
suspended and that implementation of a new PSCR factor not begin until the date
of the MPSC order authorizing adequate and compensatory relief. Detroit Edison
also proposed an adjustment whereby the revenues from the sale of excess
capacity and off-system energy would be used to mitigate the effect of stranded
costs. In December 2003, the MPSC issued an order that reinstated the PSCR
clause on January 1, 2004 and did not rule on the mitigation adjustment
proposed by Detroit Edison. Detroit Edison has filed an appeal of this order
with the Michigan Court of Appeals.

MPSC Interim Rate Order

— On February 20, 2004, the MPSC issued an order for
interim rate relief. The order authorized an interim increase in base rates, a
transition charge for customers participating in the electric Customer Choice
program and a new PSCR factor.

The interim base rate increase totaled $248 million annually, effective
February 21, 2004, and is applicable to all customers not subject to the rate
cap. The increase will be allocated to both full service customers ($240
million) and electric Customer Choice customers ($8 million). However, because
of the rate caps under PA 141, not all of the increase will be recognized in
2004. Additionally, the MPSC terminated certain transition credits and
authorized a uniform 4 mills per kWh transition charge to Choice customers
which is designed to result in $30 million in revenues, based on an estimated
7,565 gWh level of Choice sales volumes. The MPSC concluded that the
implementation of transition charges, coupled with the termination of
transition credits, will reduce the anticipated volume of Choice sales
resulting in an additional $30 million in margins. The MPSC also authorized a
PSCR factor for all customers, a credit of 1.05 mills per kWh compared to the
2.04 mills per kWh charge previously in effect. However, the MPSC order will
allow Detroit Edison to increase base rates for customers still subject to the
cap in an equal and offsetting amount with the change in the PSCR factor to
maintain the total capped rate levels currently in effect for these customers.

Although the base rate increase totaled $248 million, the interim order is only
designed to result in an increase in 2004 revenues of $71 million. This lower
amount is a result of the rate caps, the February 21, 2004 effective date and
the PSCR adjustment. Amounts collected will be subject to refund pending a
final order in this rate case.

As part of the interim order, the MPSC approved Detroit Edison’s request to
recover pension and healthcare expenses included in the rate filing. The
recovery is conditioned on Detroit Edison making minimum annual prorated
pension contributions equal to the amount of expense reflected in rates during
the period that the authorized interim rates are in effect. Detroit Edison has
agreed to comply with this requirement through the interim period until a final
order is issued in this case. Additionally, the MPSC interim order requires
Detroit Edison to continue funding the Low Income Energy Efficiency Fund at $40
million annually.

The MPSC deferred addressing other items in the rate request, including a
surcharge to recover regulatory assets, until a final rate order is issued
which is expected in the third quarter of 2004. We cannot predict the amount of
final rate relief that will be granted by the MPSC.

Electric Industry Restructuring

Electric Rates, Customer
Choice and Stranded Costs

— PA 141 provided Detroit
Edison with the right to recover net stranded costs, codified and established
January 1, 2002 as the date for full implementation of the MPSC’s existing
electric Customer Choice program, and required the MPSC to reduce residential
electric rates by 5%. At that time, PA 142 also became effective. PA 142
provided for the recovery through securitization of “qualified costs” which
consist of an electric utility’s regulatory assets, plus various costs
associated with, or resulting from, the establishment of a competitive electric
market and the issuance of securitization bonds.

Acting pursuant to PA 141, in an order issued in June 2000, the MPSC reduced
Detroit Edison’s residential electric rates by 5% and imposed a rate freeze for
all classes of customers through 2003. In April 2001, commercial and
industrial rates were lowered by 5% as a result of savings derived from the
issuance of securitization bonds in March 2001, as subsequently discussed.



Certain costs may be deferred and recovered once rates can be increased. This
rate cap may be lifted when certain market test provisions are met,
specifically, when an electric utility has no more than 30% of generation
capacity in its relevant market, with consideration for capacity needed to meet
a utility’s responsibility to serve its retail customers. Statewide,
multi-utility transmission system improvements also are required. In May 2003,
Detroit Edison submitted filings with the MPSC regarding its compliance with
the provisions of PA 141 related to market test and transmission system
improvements. Detroit Edison entered into a settlement agreement with
interested parties, indicating that the market power test provisions of PA 141
had been met. The MPSC approved the settlement agreement on February 20, 2004.

As required by PA 141, the MPSC conducted a proceeding to develop a methodology
for calculating the net stranded costs associated with electric Customer
Choice. In a December 2001 order, the MPSC determined that Detroit Edison
could recover net stranded costs associated with the fixed cost component of
its electric generation operations. Specifically, there would be an annual
proceeding or true-up before the MPSC reconciling the receipt of revenues
associated with the fixed cost component of its generation services to the
revenue requirement for the fixed cost component of those services, inclusive
of an allowance for the cost of capital. Any resulting shortfall in recovery,
net of mitigation, would be considered a net stranded cost. The MPSC, in its
December 2001 order, also determined that Detroit Edison had no net stranded
costs in 2000 and consequently established a zero net stranded cost transition
charge for billing purposes in 2002. The MPSC authorized Detroit Edison to
establish a regulatory asset to defer recovery of its incurred stranded costs,
subject to review in a subsequent annual net stranded cost proceeding. The
MPSC also determined that Detroit Edison should provide a full and offsetting
credit for the securitization and tax charges applied to electric Customer
Choice bills in 2002. In addition, the MPSC ordered an additional credit on
bills equal to the 5% rate reduction realized by full service customers. Both
credits were to be funded from savings derived from securitization. The
December 2001 order, coupled with lower wholesale power prices, has encouraged
additional customer participation in the electric Customer Choice program and
has resulted in the loss of margins attributable to generation services. In
May 2002, the MPSC denied Detroit Edison’s request for rehearing and
clarification of the December 2001 order. In June 2002, Detroit Edison filed
an appeal of the MPSC order at the Michigan Court of Appeals, challenging the
legality of specific aspects of the MPSC order. The Court of Appeals denied
Detroit Edison’s appeal.

In May 2002, Detroit Edison submitted its 2001 net stranded cost filing with
the MPSC. The filing provided refinements to the MPSC Staff’s calculation of
net stranded costs that was adopted in the December 2001 order, sought more
timely recovery of net stranded costs, and addressed issues raised by the continuation of securitization offsets and rate reduction
equalization credits. The filing supported that Detroit Edison had no net
stranded costs in 2000 and $13 million of recoverable net stranded costs
attributable to electric Customer Choice in 2001. In the fourth quarter of
2002, Detroit Edison recorded an estimated regulatory asset of $10 million for
the 2001 net stranded costs based on the MPSC Staff’s report. In July 2003, the
MPSC issued an order finding that Detroit Edison had no net stranded costs in
2000 and 2001 and established a zero net stranded cost transition charge for
billing purposes in 2003. In addition, this order clarified the inclusion of
revenue discounts granted customers under special contracts in the net stranded
cost calculation, but declined to rule on the proposed modifications to the
method for determining net stranded costs. Detroit Edison filed a petition for
rehearing of the July 2003 order, which the MPSC denied in December 2003.
Detroit Edison has appealed. During each quarter of 2003, Detroit Edison
recorded a regulatory asset representing an estimate of the cumulative stranded
costs as of that period. As a result of the MPSC July 2003 order and the
related clarifying language, we recalculated net stranded costs for 2002 and
2003. Our revised and ongoing calculations conclude that the $68 million of
net stranded costs recorded as of December 31, 2003 is appropriate.

Securitization

— In an order issued in November 2000 and
clarified in January
2001, the MPSC approved the issuance of securitization bonds to recover
qualified costs that include the unamortized investment in Fermi 2, costs of
certain other regulatory assets, Electric Choice implementation costs, costs of
issuing securitization bonds, and the costs of retiring securities with the
proceeds of securitization. The order permits the collection of these
qualifying costs from Detroit Edison’s customers.



Detroit Edison formed The Detroit Edison Securitization Funding LLC
(Securitization LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary, for the purpose of
securitizing its qualified costs. In March 2001, the Securitization LLC issued
$1.75 billion of Securitization Bonds, and Detroit Edison sold $1.75 billion of
qualified costs to the Securitization LLC. The Securitization Bonds mature
over a 14-year period and have an annual average interest rate of 6.3% over the
life of the bonds. Detroit Edison used the proceeds to retire debt and equity
in approximately equal amounts. DTE Energy corporate likewise retired
approximately 50% debt and 50% equity with the proceeds received as the sole
shareholder of Detroit Edison. Detroit Edison implemented a non-bypassable
surcharge on its customer bills, effective in March 2001, for the purpose of
collecting amounts sufficient to provide for the payment of interest and
principal and the payment of income tax on the additional revenue from the
surcharge. As a result of securitization, Detroit Edison established a
regulatory asset for securitized costs including costs that had previously been
recorded in other regulatory asset accounts.

The Securitization LLC is independent of Detroit Edison, as is its
ownership of
the qualified costs. Due to principles of consolidation, qualified costs sold
by Detroit Edison to the Securitization LLC and the securitization bonds appear
on the company’s consolidated statement of financial position. The company
makes no claim to these assets. Ownership of such assets has vested in the
Securitization LLC and been assigned to the trustee for the Securitization
Bonds. Funds collected by Detroit Edison, acting in the capacity of a servicer
for the Securitization LLC, are remitted to the trustee for the Securitization
Bonds. Neither the qualified costs which were sold nor funds collected from
Detroit Edison’s customers for the payment of costs related to the
Securitization LLC and Securitization Bonds are available to Detroit Edison’s
creditors.

Low-Income Energy Assistance Credit

- In October 2003, Detroit
Edison filed an
application with the MPSC to implement a low-income energy assistance credit
for residential electric customers. The proposed 2.6 cent per kilowatthour
credit is expected to assist many low-income customers who are experiencing
difficulties in paying their electric bills due to poor economic conditions in
Detroit Edison’s service area. Detroit Edison proposed to fund the low-income
energy assistance credit by utilizing excess securitization savings currently
being used to provide credits to electric Choice Customers. In January 2004,
the MPSC issued an order implementing a 1 cent per kilowatthour low-income
energy assistance credit for residential electric customers and terminated the
rate equalization credit for uncapped electric Customer Choice customers.

Excess Securitization Savings —

In January 2004, the MPSC
issued an order
directing Detroit Edison to file a report by March 15, 2004, of the accounting
of the savings due to securitization and the application of those savings
through December 2003. In addition, Detroit Edison was requested to include in
the report an estimate of the foregone carrying cost associated with the excess
securitization savings.

Blackout Costs

On August 14, 2003, failures in the regional power transmission
grid caused
nine of Detroit Edison’s power plants to trip offline, which left virtually all
of its 2.1 million customers without power. We estimate that amounts expensed
in 2003 related to the blackout, excluding lost margins, were approximately $25
million ($16 million net of tax). In October 2003, Detroit Edison filed an
accounting application with the MPSC requesting authority to defer outage
related costs associated with the blackout until a future rate proceeding to
recover outage costs from customers in a manner consistent with the provisions
of PA 141. We anticipate an accounting order in the third quarter of 2004.

Gas Rate Plan

In September 2003, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for an
increase
in service and distribution charges (base rates) for its gas sales and
transportation customers. The filing requests an overall increase in base rates
of $194 million per year (approximately 7% increase, inclusive of gas costs),
beginning January 1, 2005. MichCon has requested that the MPSC increase base
rates by $154 million per year on an interim basis by April 1, 2004. The
interim request is based on a projected revenue deficiency for the test year
2004. Based



on the procedural calendar established in this case, MichCon expects
an interim
order in the third quarter of 2004 and a final order relating to the $194
million base rate increase in the first quarter of 2005.

Primary factors that necessitate MichCon’s request for increased
base rates
include significant increases in routine and mandated infrastructure
improvements, increased operation and maintenance expenses, including employee
pension and health care costs, and a decline in customer consumption. The
filing also requests a permanent capital structure based on 50% debt and 50%
equity, and a proposed ROE of 11.5%. MichCon is also proposing a symmetrical
ROE sharing mechanism which would provide that shareholders retain all earnings
within a 1% band above and below the authorized ROE. If the actual ROE falls
outside of the band, customers would share between 20% and 80% of the excess or
shortfall of earnings, depending on actual ROE.

In September 2003, MichCon also filed an application with the MPSC
for the
approval of depreciation rates, which will result in a modest increase in its
composite depreciation rate. The Company anticipates that any depreciation
change will be implemented contemporaneously with a MPSC order in MichCon’s
base rate case.

Gas Industry Restructuring

In December 2001, the MPSC approved MichCon’s application for a
voluntary,
expanded permanent gas Customer Choice program, which replaced the experimental
program that expired in March 2002. Effective April 2002, up to 40% of
MichCon’s customers could elect to purchase gas from suppliers other than
MichCon. Effective April 2003, up to 60% of customers were eligible and by
April 2004, all of MichCon’s 1.2 million customers may participate in the
program. The MPSC also approved the use of deferred accounting for the recovery
of implementation costs of the gas Customer Choice program. As of December
2003, approximately 129,000 customers are participating in the gas Customer
Choice program.

Gas Cost Recovery Proceedings

2002 Plan Year

- In December 2001, the MPSC issued an order
that permitted
MichCon to implement GCR factors up to $3.62 per Mcf for January 2002 billings
and up to $4.38 per Mcf for the remainder of 2002. The order also allowed
MichCon to recognize a regulatory asset of approximately $14 million
representing the difference between the $4.38 factor and the $3.62 factor for
volumes that were unbilled at December 31, 2001. The regulatory asset is
subject to the 2002 GCR reconciliation process. In March 2003, the MPSC issued
an order in MichCon’s 2002 GCR plan case. The MPSC ordered MichCon to reduce
its gas cost recovery expenses by $26.5 million for purposes of calculating the
2002 GCR factor due to MichCon’s decision to utilize storage gas during 2001
that resulted in a gas inventory decrement for the 2001 calendar year.

Although we recorded a $26.5 million reserve in the first
quarter of 2003 to
reflect the impact of this order, a final determination of actual 2002 revenue
and expenses including any disallowances or adjustment will be decided in
MichCon’s 2002 GCR reconciliation case which was filed with the MPSC in
February 2003. Intervening parties in this proceeding are seeking to have the
MPSC disallow an additional $26 million, representing unbilled revenues at
December 2001. One party has proposed that half of the $8 million related to
the settlement of the Enron bankruptcy also be disallowed. The other two
parties to the case have recommended that the Enron bankruptcy settlement be
addressed in the 2003 GCR reconciliation case. A final order in this proceeding
is expected in 2004. In addition, we filed an appeal of the March 2003 MPSC
order with the Michigan Court of Appeals.

2003 Plan Year

- In July 2003, the MPSC approved an increase
in MichCon’s 2003
GCR rate to a maximum of $5.75 per Mcf for the billing months of August 2003
through December 2003. As of December 31, 2003, MichCon has accrued a $19
million regulatory asset representing the under-recovery of actual gas costs
incurred.



2004 Plan Year

- In September 2003, MichCon filed its 2004 GCR
plan case
proposing a maximum GCR factor of $5.36 per Mcf. MichCon agreed to switch from
a calendar year to an operational year as a condition of its settlement in the
2003 GCR Plan Case. The operational GCR year would run from April to March of
the following year. To accomplish the switch, the 2004 GCR Plan Case reflects
a 15-month transitional period, January 2004 through March 2005. Under the
transition proposal, MichCon would file two reconciliations pertaining to the
transition period; one addressing the January 2004 to March 2004 period, the
other addressing the remaining April 2004 to March 2005 period. The plan also
proposes a quarterly GCR ceiling price adjustment mechanism. This mechanism
allows MichCon to increase the maximum GCR factor to compensate for increases
in market prices thereby minimizing the possibility of a GCR under recovery.

Minimum Pension Liability

In December 2002, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability
as
required under SFAS No. 87, “

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,

” with
offsetting amounts to an intangible asset and other comprehensive income.
During the first quarter of 2003, the MPSC Staff provided an opinion that the
MPSC’s traditional rate setting process allowed for the recovery of pension
costs as measured by SFAS No. 87. Based on the MPSC Staff opinion, management
believes that it will be allowed to recover in rates the minimum pension
liability associated with its regulated operations. In 2003, we reclassified
approximately $585 million ($380 million net of tax) of other comprehensive
loss associated with the minimum pension liability to a regulatory asset.

Other

In accordance with a November 1997 MPSC order, Detroit Edison reduced
rates by
$53 million annually to reflect the scheduled reduction in the revenue
requirement for Fermi 2. The $53 million reduction was effective in January
1999. In addition, the November 1997 MPSC order authorized the deferral of $30
million of storm damage costs and amortization and recovery of the costs over a
24-month period commencing January 1998. After various legal appeals, the
Michigan Court of Appeals remanded back to the MPSC for hearing the November
1997 order. In December 2000, the MPSC issued an order reopening the case for
hearing. The parties in the case have agreed to a stipulation of fact and
waiver of hearing. In June 2002, the MPSC issued an order modifying its 1997
order that will require Detroit Edison to refund approximately $1.5 million
after January 1, 2004. In July 2002, the Michigan Attorney General filed an
appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals regarding the June 2002 MPSC Order.

We are unable to predict the outcome of the regulatory matters
discussed
herein. Resolution of these matters is dependent upon future MPSC orders,
which may materially impact the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows of the company.

NOTE 5 — NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

General

Fermi 2, our nuclear generating plant, began commercial operation in
1988.
Fermi 2 has a design electrical rating (net) of 1,150 megawatts. This plant
represents approximately 10% of Detroit Edison’s summer net rated capability.
The net book balance of the Fermi 2 plant was written off at December 31, 1998,
and an equivalent regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the Fermi 2
regulatory asset was securitized. See Note 4 - Regulatory Matters. Detroit
Edison also owns Fermi 1, a nuclear plant that was shut down in 1972 and is
currently being decommissioned. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has
jurisdiction over the licensing and operation of Fermi 2 and the
decommissioning of Fermi 1.

Property Insurance



Detroit Edison maintains several different types of property
insurance policies
specifically for the Fermi 2 plant. These policies cover such items as
replacement power and property damage. The Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited
(NEIL) is the primary supplier of these insurance polices.

Detroit Edison maintains a policy for extra expenses, including
replacement
power costs necessitated by Fermi 2’s unavailability due to an insured event.
These policies have a 12-week waiting period and provide an aggregate $490
million of coverage over a three-year period.

Detroit Edison has $500 million in primary coverage and
$2.25 billion of excess
coverage for stabilization, decontamination, debris removal, repair and/or
replacement of property and decommissioning. The combined coverage limit for
total property damage is $2.75 billion.

For multiple terrorism losses caused by acts of terrorism not covered
under the
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) of 2002 occurring within one year after the
first loss from terrorism, the NEIL policies would make available to all
insured entities up to $3.2 billion plus any amounts recovered from
reinsurance, government indemnity, or other sources to cover losses.

Under the NEIL policies, Detroit Edison could be liable for maximum
assessments
of up to approximately $28 million per event if the loss associated with any
one event at any nuclear plant in the United States should exceed the
accumulated funds available to NEIL.

Public Liability Insurance

As required by federal law, Detroit Edison maintains
$300 million of public
liability insurance for a nuclear incident. For liabilities arising from a
terrorist act outside the scope of TRIA the policy is subject to one industry
aggregate limit of $300 million. Further, under the Price-Anderson Amendments
Act of 1988 (Act), deferred premium charges up to $101 million could be levied
against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $10 million per year
per facility. Thus, deferred premium charges could be levied against all
owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the event of a nuclear incident at any
of these facilities. The Act expired on August 1, 2002. During 2003, the U.S.
Congress extended the Act for commercial nuclear facilities through December
31, 2003. However, provisions of the Act remain in effect for existing
commercial reactors. Legislation to extend the Act in conjunction with
comprehensive energy legislation is currently under debate in Congress. We
cannot predict whether the legislation will pass the Congress.

Decommissioning

The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power
plants and
requires decommissioning funding based upon a formula. The MPSC and FERC
regulate the recovery of costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both
require the use of external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi
2. Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of decommissioning
costs of Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is continuing to fund FERC jurisdictional
amounts for decommissioning even though explicit provisions are not included in
FERC rates. We believe the MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate to fund
the estimated cost of decommissioning using the NRC formula.

Detroit Edison has established a restricted external trust to hold
funds
collected from customers for decommissioning and the disposal of low-level
radioactive waste. Detroit Edison collected $36 million in 2003, $42 million
in 2002 and $38 million in 2001 from customers for decommissioning and
low-level radioactive waste disposal. Net unrealized investment gains of $62
million and losses of $39 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, were recorded
as adjustments to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and
regulatory assets. At December 31, 2003, investments in the external trust consisted
of approximately 54.8% in publicly traded equity securities, 44.4% in fixed
debt instruments and 0.8% in cash equivalents.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Detroit Edison had external
decommissioning
trust funds of $474 million and $377 million, respectively, for the future
decommissioning of Fermi 2. At December 31, 2003 and 2002,



Detroit Edison had an additional $22 million for the
decommissioning of Fermi
1. Detroit Edison also had an external decommissioning trust fund of $22
million for low-level radioactive waste disposal costs at December 31, 2003 and
$17 million as of December 31, 2002. It is estimated that the cost of
decommissioning Fermi 2, when its license expires in 2025, will be $1.0 billion
in 2003 dollars and $3.4 billion in 2025 dollars, using a 6% inflation rate.
In 2001, the company began the decommissioning of Fermi 1, with the goal of
removing the radioactive material and terminating the Fermi 1 license. The
decommissioning of Fermi 1 is expected to be complete by 2009.

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 143, Detroit Edison recorded a
retirement
obligation liability for the decommissioning of Fermi 1 and 2 and reversed
previously recognized decommissioning liabilities. We continue to have
liability for the removal of the non-nuclear portion of the plants of $67
million at December 31, 2003.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982,
Detroit Edison
has a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the future storage
and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is obligated
to pay the DOE a fee of one mill per net kilowatthour of Fermi 2 electricity
generated and sold. The fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense. Delays
have occurred in the DOE’s program for the acceptance and disposal of spent
nuclear fuel at a permanent repository. Until the DOE is able to fulfill its
obligation under the contract, Detroit Edison is responsible for the spent
nuclear fuel storage. Detroit Edison estimates that existing storage capacity
will be sufficient until 2007. Detroit Edison has entered into litigation
against the DOE for damages caused by the DOE not accepting spent nuclear fuel
on a timely basis.

the same percentage of the plant’s operation, maintenance and capital
improvements costs.

Ludington Hydroelectric Pumped Storage

Operation, maintenance and other expenses of the Ludington

Internal Revenue Code Section 29 provides a tax credit for
qualified fuels
produced and sold by a taxpayer to an unrelated party during the taxable year.
Section 29 tax credits earned but not utilized of $497 million are carried
forward indefinitely as alternative minimum tax credits. The majority of our
tax credit properties, including all of our synfuel projects, have received
private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that provide
assurance as to the appropriateness of using these credits to offset taxable
income, however, these tax credits are subject to IRS audit and adjustment.

As a result of the MCN Energy acquisition we have a net operating
loss
carryforward of $239 million that expires in years 2018 through 2020. We do
not believe that a valuation allowance is required, as we expect to utilize the
loss carryforward prior to its expiration.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax
effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities
and the reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent according to the
classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities not related to assets or liabilities are classified according to
the expected reversal date of the temporary differences.



Deferred income tax assets (liabilities) were comprised of the
following at
December 31:

The IRS is currently conducting audits of our federal income tax
returns for
the years 1998 through 2001 and of the MCN Energy federal income tax returns
for 1999 through May 31, 2001. In addition, four of our
synfuel facilities are under audit by the IRS for 2001. We believe that our
accrued tax liabilities are adequate for all years.

NOTE 8 – COMMON STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

Common Stock

In June 2002, we issued 6.325 million shares of common stock at
$43.25 per
share, grossing $274 million. Net proceeds from the offering were
approximately $265 million.

On May 31, 2001, we issued approximately 29 million shares
of common stock,
valued at $1.06 billion, as part of the consideration to purchase all of the
outstanding common stock of MCN Energy. See Note 3 – Acquisitions and
Dispositions. The newly issued shares were valued at the average market price
of our common stock on February 28, 2001, the announcement date of the revised
merger agreement.

In 2001, DTE Energy repurchased approximately 10.5 million
shares of common
stock with a total cost of approximately $438 million.

Under the DTE Energy Company Long-Term Incentive Plan, we grant
non-vested
stock awards to management. At the time of grant, DTE Energy records the fair
value of the non-vested awards as unearned compensation, which is reflected as
a reduction in common stock. The number of non-vested stock awards is included
in the number of common shares outstanding; however, for purposes of computing
basic earnings per share, non-vested stock awards are excluded.

Shareholders’ Rights Plan

We have a Shareholders’ Rights Plan designed to maximize
shareholders’ value
should DTE Energy be acquired. The rights are attached to and trade with
shares of DTE Energy’s common stock until they are exercisable upon certain
triggering events. The rights expire in 2007.



Earnings per Share

We report both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings
per share
is computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share assume the issuance of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding
during the period and the repurchase of common shares that would have occurred
with proceeds from the assumed issuance. Diluted earnings per share assume the
exercise of stock options, vesting of non-vested stock awards, and the issuance
of performance share awards. A reconciliation of both calculations is presented
in the following table:

Options to purchase approximately five million shares of common stock
were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares,
thus making these securities anti-dilutive.



NOTE 9 - LONG-TERM DEBT AND PREFERRED SECURITIES

Long Term Debt

Our long-term debt outstanding and weighted average interest rates of
debt
outstanding at December 31 were:

During 2003 and 2002, we issued and optionally redeemed long-term
debt
consisting of the following:





In the years 2004 - 2008, our long-term debt maturities are
$467 million, $512
million, $680 million, $174 million and $455 million, respectively.

Remarketable Securities

At December 31, 2003, $175 million of notes of Detroit
Edison and MichCon were
subject to periodic remarketings, no remarketings will take place in 2004. We
direct the remarketing agents to remarket these securities at the lowest
interest rate necessary to produce a par bid. In the event that a remarketing
fails, we would be required to purchase these securities.

Quarterly Income Debt Securities (QUIDS)

Each series of QUIDS provides that interest will be paid quarterly.
However,
Detroit Edison has the right to extend the interest payment period on the
QUIDS for up to 20 consecutive interest payment periods. Interest would
continue to accrue during the deferral period. If this right is exercised,
Detroit Edison may not declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or
acquire, any of its capital stock during the deferral period.

Equity-Linked Securities

In June 2002, we issued 6.9 million equity security units with
gross proceeds
from the issuance of $172.5 million. An equity security unit consists of a
stock purchase contract and a senior note of DTE Energy. Under the stock
purchase contracts, we will sell, and equity security unit holders must buy,
shares of DTE Energy common stock in August 2005 for $172.5 million. The issue
price per share and the exact number of common shares to be sold is dependent
on the market value of a share in August 2005. The issue price will be not
less than $43.25 or more than $51.90 per common share, with the corresponding
number of shares issued of not more than 4.0 million or less than 3.3 million
shares. We are also obligated to pay the security unit holders a quarterly
contract adjustment payment at an annual rate of 4.15% of the stated amount
until the purchase contract settlement date. We recorded the present value of
the contract adjustment payments of $26 million in long-term debt with an
offsetting reduction in shareholders’ equity. The liability is reduced as the
contract adjustment payments are made.

Each senior note has a stated value of $25, pays an annual interest
rate of
4.60% and matures in August 2007. The senior notes are pledged as collateral
to secure the security unit holders’ obligation to purchase DTE Energy common
stock under the stock purchase contracts. The security unit holders may
satisfy their obligations under the stock purchase contracts by allowing the
senior notes to be remarketed with proceeds being paid to DTE Energy as
consideration for the purchase of stock under the stock purchase contracts.
Alternatively, holders may choose to continue holding the senior notes and use
cash as consideration for the purchase of stock under the stock purchase
contracts.

Net proceeds from the equity security unit issuance totaled
$167 million.
Expenses incurred in connection with this issuance totaled $5.6 million and
were allocated between the senior notes and the stock purchase contracts. The
amount allocated to the senior notes was deferred and will be recognized as
interest expense over the term of the notes. The amount allocated to the
purchase contracts was charged to equity.



Trust Preferred-Linked Securities

We have interests in various unconsolidated trusts that were formed
for the
sole purpose of issuing preferred securities and lending the gross proceeds to
DTE Energy. The sole assets of the trusts are debt securities of DTE Energy
with terms similar to those of the related preferred securities. Payments we
make are used by the trusts to make cash distributions on the preferred
securities it has issued.

We have the right to extend interest payment periods on the debt
securities.
Should we exercise this right, we cannot declare or pay dividends on, or
redeem, purchase or acquire, any of our capital stock during the deferral
period.

DTE Energy has issued certain guaranties with respect to payments on
the
preferred securities. These guaranties, when taken together with our
obligations under the debt securities and related indenture, provide full and
unconditional guarantees of the trusts’ obligations under the preferred
securities.

Financing costs for these issuances were paid for and deferred by DTE
Energy.
These costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the
estimated lives of the related securities.

The $100 million of 8.625% preferred securities, due 2038, was
called in
December 2003 and was redeemed in January 2004. Accordingly, the underlying
DTE Energy debt security was also simultaneously redeemed.

Cross Default Provisions

Substantially all of the net utility properties of Detroit Edison and
MichCon
are subject to the lien of mortgages. Should Detroit Edison or MichCon fail to
timely pay their indebtedness under these mortgages, such failure will create
cross defaults in the indebtedness of DTE Energy Corporate.

Preferred and Preference Securities
– Authorized and
Unissued

At December 31, 2003, DTE Energy had 5 million shares of
preferred stock
without par value authorized, with no shares issued. Of such amount, 1.6
million shares are reserved for issuance in accordance with the Shareholders’
Rights Plan.

At December 31, 2003, Detroit Edison had 6.75 million
shares of preferred stock
with a par value of $100 per share and 30 million shares of preference stock
with a par value of $1 per share authorized, with no shares issued.

At December 31, 2003, Enterprises had 25 million shares of
preferred stock
without par value authorized, with no shares issued.

At December 31, 2003, MichCon had 7 million shares of
preferred stock with a
par value of $1 per share and 4 million shares of preference stock with a par
value of $1 per share authorized, with no shares issued.

NOTE 10 - SHORT-TERM CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS

In October 2003, we entered into a
$350 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit
facility and a $350 million three-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of banks. These credit facilities may be utilized for general
corporate borrowings, but primarily are intended to provide liquidity support
for DTE Energy’s commercial paper program up to $700 million. In addition, we
had approximately $100 million of letters of credit outstanding against these
facilities at December 31, 2003, which represent guarantees to
third parties under which no amounts were outstanding. These agreements require the Company to
maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than .65 to l and
“earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (EBITDA) to
interest ratio of no less than 2 to 1. DTE Energy is currently in compliance
with these financial covenants. Also, in October 2003, DTE Energy’s
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Detroit Edison and MichCon, entered into similar
revolving credit facilities. Detroit Edison entered into a $137.5 million,
364-day facility and a $137.5 million, three-year facility. MichCon entered
into a $162.5 million,



364-day facility and a $162.5 million, three-year
facility. Should either Detroit Edison or MichCon have delinquent debt
obligations of at least $25 million to any creditor, such delinquency will be
considered a default under DTE Energy’s credit agreements.

As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding commercial paper of
$239 million
and other short-term borrowings of $31 million. At December 31, 2002, we had
outstanding commercial paper of $413 million and other short-term borrowings of
$1 million.

Detroit Edison has a $200 million short-term financing agreement
secured by
customer accounts receivable. This agreement contains certain covenants related
to the delinquency of accounts receivable. Detroit Edison is currently in
compliance with these covenants. We had $100 million outstanding under this
financing agreement at December 31, 2003.

The weighted average interest rates for short-term borrowings were
1.9% and
1.7% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

NOTE 11 – CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES

Lessee

– We lease various assets under capital and operating
leases, including
locomotives, coal cars, a gas storage field, office buildings, a warehouse,
computers, vehicles and other equipment. The lease arrangements expire at
various dates through 2029. Portions of the office buildings are subleased to
tenants.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2003
were:

Total minimum lease payments for operating leases have not been
reduced by
future minimum sublease rentals totaling $8 million under non-cancelable
subleases expiring at various dates to 2019.

Rental expenses for operating leases
was $73 million in 2003,
$40 million in
2002 and $19 million in 2001.

Lessor

- MichCon leases a portion of its pipeline system to
the Vector Pipeline
Partnership through a capital lease contract that expires in 2020, with renewal
options extending for five years. The components of the net investment in the
capital lease at December 31, 2003, were as follows:



NOTE 12 - FINANCIAL AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We comply with SFAS No. 133, “

Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

.” SFAS No. 133, established accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Listed
below are important SFAS No. 133 requirements:

•

All derivative instruments must be recognized as assets or liabilities
and measured at fair value, unless they meet the normal purchases and
sales exemption.

•

The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of
the derivative instrument and whether it is designated as a hedge and
qualifies for hedge accounting.

•

Special accounting is allowed for a derivative instrument qualifying
as a hedge and designated as a hedge for the variability of cash flow
associated with a forecasted transaction. Gain or loss associated with
the effective portion of the hedge is recorded in other comprehensive
income. The ineffective portion is recorded to earnings. Amounts
recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to net
income when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.

•

If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is likely the
forecasted transaction will not occur, net gains or losses are
immediately recorded into earnings.

•

Special accounting is allowed for a derivative instrument qualifying
as a hedge and designated as a hedge of the changes in fair value of
an existing asset, liability or firm commitment. Gain or loss on the
hedging instrument is recorded into earnings. The gain or loss on the
underlying asset, liability or firm commitment is also recorded into
earnings.

Our primary market risk exposure is associated with commodity prices,
credit,
interest rates and foreign currency. We have risk management policies to
monitor and decrease market risks. We use derivative instruments to manage
some of the exposure. Except for the activities of the Energy Marketing &
Trading segment, we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading
purposes. The fair value of all derivatives is shown as “assets or liabilities
from risk management and trading activities” in the consolidated statement of
financial position.

Commodity Price Risk

Regulated Operations

Detroit Edison uses forward energy, capacity, and futures contracts
to manage
changes in the price of electricity and natural gas. Changes in fair value of
derivatives are recognized currently in earnings, unless hedge accounting and
the normal purchase and sale exceptions apply. Changes in fair value of
derivatives designated and qualifying as an effective cash flow hedge are
recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss and reclassified into
earnings. Any changes in fair value of ineffective cash flow hedges are
recognized currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of normal contracts
are not recorded. These contracts are recorded on an accrual basis.
There were no commodity price risk cash flow hedges for regulated
operations at December 31, 2003.

Detroit Edison operating policy is that transactions for electricity
or fuel
are not done in a speculative manner, but to optimize the efficiency of the
power supply costs. All contracts entered into by Detroit Edison to sell energy
are physically delivered. All purchases of power are considered capacity
contracts under SFAS No. 133 (as amended by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149). In
addition, the summer shortfall calculation submitted to the MPSC is in support
of our short positions. It is based on management’s judgment of the above
criteria that Detroit Edison’s commodity contracts are considered normal.

MichCon has firm-priced contracts for a substantial portion of its
expected gas
supply requirements through 2004. These contracts are designated and qualify
for the normal purchases exception under SFAS No. 133. Accordingly, MichCon does
not account for such contracts as derivatives.

Non-Regulated Operations

Energy Marketing & Trading markets and trades wholesale
electricity and natural
gas physical products, trades financial instruments, and provides risk
management services utilizing energy commodity derivative instruments.
Forwards, futures, options and swap agreements are used to manage exposure to
the risk of



market price and volume fluctuations on its operations. This risk
minimization strategy is being accounted for by marking to market its commodity
forwards and financial derivatives so they substantially offset. This fair
value accounting better aligns financial reporting with the way the business is
managed and its performance measured. Unrealized gains and losses resulting
from marking to market commodity-related physical and financial derivatives
utilized in trading operations are recorded as adjustments to revenues.

Energy Marketing & Trading experiences earnings volatility as a
result of its
gas inventory and other non-derivative assets that do not qualify for mark to
market accounting under generally accepted accounting principles. Although the
risks associated with these asset positions are substantially offset,
requirements to revalue the underlying trades will result in unrealized gains
and losses that will eventually reverse upon settlement.

Credit Risk

We are exposed to credit risk if customers or counterparties do not
comply with
their contractual obligations. We maintain credit policies that significantly
minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of
potential customers’ and counterparties’ financial condition, credit rating,
collateral requirements or other credit enhancements such as letters of credit
or guarantees. We use standardized agreements that allow the netting of
positive and negative transactions associated with a single counterparty.

Interest Rate Risk

We use interest rate swaps to hedge
the risk associated with interest rate payments and expense. During 2000, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps and
treasury locks
to limit our sensitivity to market interest rate risk associated with the
issuance of long-term debt used to acquire MCN Energy. Such instruments were
designated as cash flow hedges. In the first quarter of 2001, a loss of
approximately $5 million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
loss into earnings. We made this decision since it was probable that certain
transactions associated with the issuance of long-term debt would not occur
within the originally anticipated time frame. This loss was reported as a
component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. In
2001, we issued long-term debt with varying maturities and terminated these
hedges at a cost of $83 million. The corresponding loss on these instruments is
included in other comprehensive loss. During the next 30 years, amounts
recorded in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to interest expense
as the related interest affects earnings. In 2004 we estimate reclassifying $10
million of losses into interest expense.

Foreign Currency Risk

During 2003, we entered into forward purchases of foreign currency
contracts to
hedge fixed Canadian dollar commitments existing under power purchase and sale
contracts and gas transportation contracts. We entered into these contracts to
mitigate any price volatility with respect to fluctuations of the Canadian
dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Certain of these contracts are designated
as cash flow hedges and were fully effective as of December 31, 2003.

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments is determined by using
various market
data and other valuation techniques. The table below shows the fair value
relative to the carrying value for non-affiliated long-term debt securities:

NOTE 13 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Synthetic Fuel Operations

We operate nine synthetic fuel production facilities, four of which
are wholly
owned. Synfuel facilities chemically change coal, including waste and marginal
coal, into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable IRS rules. Section
29 of the Internal Revenue Code provides tax credits for the production and
sale
of solid synthetic fuels produced from coal. To qualify for the Section 29 tax
credits, the synthetic fuel must meet three primary conditions: (1) there must
be a significant chemical change in the coal feedstock, (2) the product must be
sold to an unaffiliated entity, and (3) the production facility must have been
placed in service before July 1, 1998. In addition to meeting the qualifying
conditions, a taxpayer must have sufficient taxable income to earn the Section
29 credits.

In May 2003, the IRS suspended the issuance of PLRs relating to
synthetic fuel
projects pending their review of issues concerning chemical change which is the
basis for earning Section 29 tax credits. In October 2003, the IRS concluded
its assessment of the chemical change process involved in synfuel production
and resumed issuing PLRs. The IRS determined that the test procedures and
results used by taxpayers are scientifically valid if the procedures are
applied in a consistent and unbiased manner. The Company believes that its
synthetic fuel facilities currently meet the new, more stringent sampling and
data/record retention requirements announced by the IRS. We had previously
received favorable PLRs from the IRS on seven of our nine synfuel plants. In
November 2003, we received favorable PLRs for the remaining two synfuel plants.
The IRS is currently reviewing procedures and results at four of our synfuels
plants in conjunction with their audits of our federal income tax returns for
2001. We believe our synthetic fuel plants operate in accordance with the PLRs.
Through December 31, 2003, we have generated approximately $484 million of
synfuel tax credits.

To optimize tax credits generated from these facilities, we
implemented a
series of initiatives, including selling interests in synfuel projects and
monetizing certain in-the-money derivatives contracts which allowed us to fully
utilize the tax credits generated in 2003. We are continuing our efforts to
sell interests in all of our synfuel projects. Sales of interests in synfuel
projects allow us to accelerate cash flow and taxable income, while maintaining
a stable net income base. As the sale of interests in synfuel projects usually
requires the reconfirmation of the PLR, the timing and number of our synfuel
project interest sales were influenced by the IRS’ five month suspension of
issuing new and reconfirming PLRs.

The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the
Committee on
Governmental Affairs has begun an investigation of the synthetic fuel industry
and its producers. DTE Energy, along with other industry participants, received
a request to produce certain documents pertaining to its synfuel operations.
DTE Energy is in the process of complying with this request. We have no further
knowledge of the scope of the investigation, when the investigation will be
completed or the potential results of the investigation.

Guarantees

In certain circumstances we enter into contractual guarantees. We may
guarantee
another entity’s obligation in the event it fails to perform. We may provide
guarantees in certain indemnification agreements. Finally, we may provide
indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. Below are the details of
specific material guarantees we currently provide. Our other guarantees are
not individually material and total approximately $26 million at December 31,
2003.

Sale of Tax Credit Properties

We have provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction
with the
sales of interests in our synfuel facilities. The guarantees cover general
commercial, environmental and tax-related exposure and will survive until 90
days after expiration of all applicable statute of limitations, or
indefinitely, depending on the nature of the guaranty. We estimate that our
maximum liability under these guarantees at December 31, 2003 totals $300
million.



Parent Company Guarantee of Subsidiary Obligations

We have issued guarantees for the benefit of various non-regulated
subsidiary
transactions. In the event that DTE Energy’s credit rating is downgraded below
investment grade, certain of these guarantees would require
us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately $290 million at
December 31, 2003. This estimated amount fluctuates based upon the provisions
and maturities of the underlying agreements.

Personal Property Taxes

Detroit Edison, MichCon and other Michigan utilities have asserted
that
Michigan’s valuation tables result in the substantial overvaluation of utility
personal property. Valuation tables established by the Michigan State Tax
Commission (STC) are used to determine the taxable value of personal property
based on the property’s age. In November 1999, the STC approved new valuation
tables that more accurately recognize the value of a utility’s personal
property. The new tables became effective in 2000 and are currently used to
calculate property tax expense. However, several local taxing jurisdictions
have taken legal action attempting to prevent the STC from implementing the new
valuation tables and have continued to prepare assessments based on the
superseded tables. The legal actions regarding the appropriateness of the new
tables were before the Michigan Tax Tribunal (MTT) which, in April 2002, issued
its decision essentially affirming the validity of the STC’s new tables. In
June 2002, petitioners in the case filed an appeal of the MTT’s decision with
the Michigan Court of Appeals. On January 20, 2004, the Michigan Court of
Appeals upheld the validity of the new tables.

Detroit Edison and MichCon record property tax expense based on the
new tables.
Detroit Edison and MichCon will seek to apply the new tables retroactively and
to ultimately settle the pending tax appeals related to 1997 through 1999. This
is a solution supported by the STC in the past.

Energy Gas Environmental Matters

Prior to the construction of major natural gas pipelines, gas for
heating and
other uses was manufactured from processes involving coal, coke or oil.
Enterprises (MichCon and Citizens) owns, or previously owned, 18 such former
manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites.

During the mid-1980’s, Enterprises conducted preliminary
environmental
investigations at former MGP sites, and some contamination related to the
by-products of gas manufacturing was discovered at each site. The existence of
these sites and the results of the environmental investigations have been
reported to the MDEQ. None of these former MGP sites is on the National
Priorities List prepared by the EPA.

Enterprises is remediating seven of the former MGP sites and conducting more
extensive investigations at six other former MGP sites. Enterprises
received MDEQ closure of one site and a determination that it is
not a responsible party for three other sites. Enterprises received
closure from the EPA in 2002 for one site.

In 1984, Enterprises established a $12 million reserve for
environmental
investigation and remediation. During 1993, MichCon received MPSC approval of
a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and remediation
costs incurred at former MGP sites in excess of this reserve.

Enterprises employed outside consultants to evaluate remediation
alternatives
for these sites, to assist in estimating its potential liabilities and to
review its archived insurance policies. The findings of these investigations
indicate that the estimated total expenditures for investigation and
remediation activities for



these sites could range from $30 million to $170
million based on undiscounted 1995 costs. As a result of these studies,
Enterprises accrued an additional liability and a corresponding regulatory
asset of $35 million during 1995.

During 2003, Enterprises spent $1.5 million investigating and
remediating these
former MGP sites. At December 31, 2003, the reserve balance was $23 million of
which $5 million was classified as current. Any significant change in
assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination
and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs
for the sites and, therefore, have an effect on the company’s financial
position and cash flows. However, we believe the cost deferral and rate
recovery mechanism approved by the MPSC will prevent environmental costs from
having a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Commitments

Detroit Edison has an Energy Purchase Agreement to purchase steam and
electricity from the Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Authority (GDRRA).
Under the Agreement, Detroit Edison will purchase steam through 2008 and
electricity through June 2024. In 1996, a special charge to income was recorded
that included a reserve for steam purchase commitments in excess of replacement
costs from 1997 through 2008. The reserve for steam purchase commitments is
being amortized to fuel, purchased power and gas expense with non-cash
accretion expense being recorded through 2008. In 2001, due to changes in
estimated future replacement costs we reduced the reserve for future steam
purchase commitments by $22 million. We purchased $30 million of steam and
electricity in 2003, $37 million in 2002 and $41 million in 2001. We estimate
annual steam and electric purchase commitments from 2004 until 2008 will not
exceed $150 million. As discussed in Note 3 – Acquisitions and
Dispositions, in January 2003, we sold the steam heating business of Detroit
Edison to Thermal Ventures II, LLP. Due to terms of the sale, Detroit Edison
remains contractually obligated to GDRRA until 2008 and recorded an additional
liability of $20 million for future commitments. Also, we have guaranteed bank
loans that Thermal Ventures II, LLP may use for capital improvements to the
steam heating system.

The EPA issued ozone
transport
regulations and, in December, 2003, proposed additional emission regulations
relating to ozone, fine particulate and mercury air pollution. The new rules
have led to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and particulate emissions. To
comply with these new controls, Detroit Edison has spent approximately $560
million through December 2003 and estimates that it will spend
approximately $40 million in 2004 and incur up to an
additional approximately $1.2 billion of future capital expenditures over the
next five to eight years to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control
requirements. Under the
June 2000 Michigan restructuring legislation, beginning January 1, 2004, annual
return of and on this capital expenditure, in excess of current depreciation
levels, would be deferred in ratemaking, until after the expiration of the rate
cap period, presently expected to end December 31, 2005.

To ensure a reliable supply of natural gas at competitive prices,
Enterprises
has entered into long-term purchase and transportation contracts with various
suppliers and producers. In general, purchases are under fixed price and
volume contracts or formulas based on market prices. Enterprises has firm
purchase commitments through 2010 for approximately 342 Bcf of gas.
Enterprises expects that sales, based on warmer-than-normal weather, will
exceed its minimum purchase commitments. Enterprises has long-term
transportation and storage contracts with various companies expiring on various
dates through the year 2021. Enterprises is also committed to pay demand
charges of approximately $68 million during 2004 related to firm purchase and
transportation agreements.

In February 2004, Enterprises terminated a long-term gas exchange agreement
and modified
our future purchase commitments under a related transportation agreement with
an interstate pipeline company, effective March 31, 2004. The
agreements were at rates that were not reflective of current
market conditions and had been fair valued under generally accepted
accounting principles. In 2002, the fair value of the transportation
agreement was frozen when it no longer met the definition of a
derivative as a result of FERC Order 637. The fair value amounts were being amortized to income over the life of the
related agreements, representing a net liability of approximately $75



million as
of December 31, 2003. We are currently negotiating new
agreements with the interstate pipeline company. We will record an
appropriate adjustment to the liability after all related agreements
have been finalized.

At December 31, 2003, we have
also entered into long-term fuel supply commitments through 2008 of
approximately
$405 million. We estimate that 2004 base level capital
expenditures will be $1.0 billion. We have made certain commitments in
connection with expected capital expenditures.

Bankruptcies

We purchase and sell electricity, gas, coal and coke from and to
numerous
companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy and retail industries. A
number of customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We have negotiated or are currently involved in
negotiations with each of the companies, or their successor companies, that
have filed for bankruptcy protection. We regularly review contingent matters
relating to purchase and sale contracts and record provisions for amounts
considered probable of loss. We believe our previously accrued amounts are
adequate for probable losses. The final resolution of these matters is not
expected to have a material effect on our financial statements in the period
they are resolved.

Other

Several Midwest utilities seek to recover lost transmission revenues
associated
with the creation of multiple regional transmission organizations in the
Midwest. Positions advocated by several parties in a FERC proceeding could require that Detroit Edison and its
customers be responsible for increased transmission costs. Detroit Edison
continues to actively participate in this proceeding and depending upon the
outcome would subsequently seek rate recovery of these costs.

We are involved in certain legal, regulatory, administrative and
environmental
proceedings before various courts, arbitration panels and governmental agencies
concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business. These
proceedings include certain contract disputes, environmental reviews and
investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and pending judicial
matters. We cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. We
regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that are
considered probable of loss. The resolution of pending proceedings is not
expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial statements in
the period they are resolved.

See Note 4 and Note 5 for a discussion of contingencies related to
Regulatory
Matters and Nuclear Operations.



NOTE 14 - RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND TRUSTEED ASSETS

Qualified Pension Plan Benefits

We have defined benefit retirement plans for eligible union and
nonunion
employees. Prior to December 31, 2001, we had three separate defined benefit
retirement plans. Effective December 31, 2001, two of the defined benefit
retirement plans merged into one plan. The plans are noncontributory, cover
substantially all employees and provide retirement benefits based on the
employees’ years of benefit service, average final compensation and age at
retirement. Certain nonrepresented employees are covered under cash balance
benefits based on annual employer contributions and interest credits. Our
policy is to fund pension costs by contributing the minimum amount required by
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and additional amounts we
deem appropriate.

We employ a consistent formal process in determining the long-term
rate of
return for various asset classes. We evaluate input from our consultants,
including their review of historic financial market risks and returns and
long-term historic relationships between the asset classes of equities, fixed
income and other assets, consistent with the widely accepted capital market
principle that asset classes with higher volatility generate a greater return
over the long-term. Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates,
asset class risks and asset class returns are evaluated and considered before
long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio
return is also established employing a consistent formal process, with due
consideration of diversification, active investment management and rebalancing.
Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonability.

We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of
equities, fixed
income and other investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan
assets consistent with prudent levels of risk. The intent of this strategy is
to minimize plan expenses over the long-term. Risk tolerance is established
through consideration of future plan cash flows, plan funded status, and
corporate financial considerations. The investment portfolio contains a
diversified blend of equity, fixed income and other investments. Furthermore,
equity investments are diversified across U.S and non-U.S. stocks, growth and
value investment styles, and large and small market capitalizations. Other
assets such as private equity and absolute return funds are used judiciously to
enhance long term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely
manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond
the market value of the underlying investments. Investment risk is measured and
monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic
asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

In December 2002, we recognized an additional minimum pension
liability as
required under SFAS No. 87, “

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

.” An
additional pension liability may be required when the accumulated benefit
obligation of the plan exceeds the fair value of plan assets. Under SFAS No.
87, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability of $839 million, ($531
million after netting the previously recognized prepaid pension asset
associated with the non represented plan), an intangible asset of $54 million
and other comprehensive loss of $785 million ($510 million after tax). In
2003, Detroit Edison reclassified $572 million of other comprehensive loss
related to the minimum pension liability to a regulatory asset.

At December 31, 2003 the minimum pension liability was
$760 million, intangible
asset was $41 million, regulatory asset was $572 million, other comprehensive
loss was $147 million ($96 million after tax) and deferred taxes were $51
million.



We plan on making a $170 million contribution of DTE Energy
common stock to our
defined benefit retirement plans in the first quarter of 2004. A contribution is not required under
ERISA.

We also sponsor defined contribution retirement savings plans.
Participation
in one of these plans is available to substantially all represented and
nonrepresented employees. We match employee contributions up to certain
predefined limits based upon eligible compensation, the employee’s contribution
rate and years of credited service. The cost of these plans was $26 million in
2003, $25 million in 2002 and $26 million in 2001.

Nonqualified Pension Benefit Plans

We maintain supplemental nonqualified, noncontributory,
retirement
benefit plans for selected management employees. These plans provide for
benefits that supplement those provided by DTE Energy’s other retirement plans.

Benefit costs were calculated assuming health care cost trend rates
beginning
at 9.0% for 2004 and decreasing to 5.0% in 2009 and thereafter for persons
under age 65 and decreasing from 8.0% to 5.0% for persons age 65 and over. A
one-percentage-point increase in health care cost trend rates would have
increased the total service cost and interest cost components of benefit costs
by $18 million. The accumulated benefit obligation would have increased by
$148 million at December 31, 2003. A one-percentage-point decrease in the
health care cost trend rates would have decreased the total service and
interest cost components of benefit costs by $16 million and would have
decreased the accumulated benefit obligation by $132 million at December 31,
2003.

The Company amended its postretirement
health care and life insurance plans to reduce benefits, modify
eligibility criteria and increase retiree co-pays. The changes
reduced the postretirement benefit obligation by $126 million, the
2003 postretirement costs by $17 million and the expected 2004
postretirement costs by $29 million.

life insurance plans in January 2004.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization
Act was signed into law. This Act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least
actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law. We have elected to
defer the provisions of the Act, and our measures of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost
do not reflect the effects of the Act, if any. Specific authoritative guidance, when
issued by the FASB, could require us to re-determine the impact of the Act and
change previously reported information.

Grantor Trust

MichCon maintains a Grantor Trust that invests in life insurance
contracts and
income securities. Employees and retirees have no right, title or interest in
the assets of the Grantor Trust, and MichCon can revoke the trust subject to
providing the MPSC with prior notification. We record our investment
at market value and account for unrealized gains and losses in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

NOTE 15 – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The DTE Energy Company 2001 Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant of
incentive
stock options, non-qualifying stock options, stock awards, performance shares
and performance units. A maximum of 18 million shares of common stock may be
issued under the plan. Participants in the plan include our employees and
Board members. As of December 31, 2003, no performance units have been granted
under the plan.

Prior to 2001, stock options, stock awards and performance shares
were issued
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan adopted in 1995.

Options

Options are exercisable at a rate according to the terms of the
individual
stock option award agreements. The options will expire 10 years after the date
of the grant. The option exercise price equals the fair value of the stock on
the date that the option was granted. Stock option activity was as follows:



The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at
December 31, 2003, was
$27.62 to $46.74. The number, weighted average exercise price and weighted
average remaining contractual life of options outstanding were as follows:

We apply APB Opinion 25, “

Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recorded for options granted. As
required by SFAS No. 123, “

Stock Awards

Under the plan, stock awards are granted and restricted for varying
periods,
which currently do not exceed four years. Participants have all rights of a
shareholder with respect to a stock award, including the right to receive
dividends and vote the shares; provided, that during such period (i) a
participant may not sell, transfer,



pledge, exchange or otherwise dispose of
shares granted pursuant to a stock award; (ii) we shall retain custody of the
certificates evidencing shares granted pursuant to a stock award; and (iii) the
participant will deliver to us a stock power with respect to each stock award.

The stock awards are recorded at cost that approximates the market
value on the
date of grant. We account for stock awards as unearned compensation, which is
recorded as a reduction to common stock. The cost is amortized to compensation
expense over the vesting period. Stock award activity for the years ended
December 31 was:

Performance Share Awards

Under the plan, performance shares are awards stated with reference
to a
specified number of shares of common stock that entitles the holder to receive
a cash payment or shares of common stock or a combination thereof. The final
value of the award is determined by the achievement of certain performance
objectives, as defined in the plan. The awards vest as of the end of a
specified period. Beginning with the grant date, we account for performance
share awards by accruing an amount based on the following: (i) the number of
shares expected to be awarded based on the probable achievement of certain
performance objectives, (ii) the market value of the shares, and (iii) the
vesting period. For 2003, 2002 and 2001, we accrued compensation expense
related to performance share awards totaling $5.5 million, $3.6 million and
$1.2 million, respectively.

During the applicable restriction period, the recipient of a
performance share
award has no shareholder rights. However, recipients will be paid an amount
equal to the dividend equivalent on such shares. Performance share awards are
nontransferable and are subject to risk of forfeiture. As of December 31,
2003, there were 617,404 performance share awards outstanding.



NOTE 16 - SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

Beginning in 2002, we realigned our internal and external financial
reporting
structure into three strategic business units (Energy Resources, Energy
Distribution and Energy Gas) that have both regulated and non-regulated
operations. The balance of our business consists of Corporate & Other. Based
on this structure we set strategic goals, allocate resources and evaluate
performance. This results in the following nine reportable segments:

Energy Resources

•

Regulated – Power Generation

operations include the
power
generation services of Detroit Edison, the company’s electric
utility. Electricity is generated from Detroit Edison’s numerous
fossil plants or its nuclear plant and sold throughout
Southeastern Michigan to residential, commercial, industrial and
wholesale customers.

•

Non-regulated

•

Energy Services

is comprised of various businesses that
develop,
acquire and manage energy-related assets and services. Such projects
include coke production, synfuels production, on-site energy projects
and merchant generation facilities.

•

Energy Marketing & Trading

consists of the electric
and gas marketing
and trading operations of DTE Energy Trading Company and the natural gas
marketing and trading operations of DTE Enterprises, which was acquired
as part of the MCN Energy acquisition. Energy Marketing & Trading
enters into forwards, futures, swaps and option contracts as part of its
trading strategy.

•

Other non-regulated

operations consist of businesses
involved in coal
services and landfill gas recovery.

Energy Distribution

•

Regulated  — Power Distribution

operations include
the
electric distribution services of Detroit Edison. Energy
Distribution distributes electricity generated by Energy
Resources to Detroit Edison’s 2.1 million residential,
commercial and industrial customers.

•

Non-regulated

operations include businesses that market
and
distribute a broad portfolio of distributed generation
products, provide application engineering, and monitor and
manage system operations.

Energy Gas

•

Regulated

operations include gas distribution services
provided
by MichCon, the company’s gas utility that purchases, stores
and distributes natural gas throughout Michigan to 1.2 million
residential, commercial and industrial customers.

•

Non-regulated

operations include the production of gas and
the
gathering, processing and storing of gas. Certain pipeline and
storage assets are primarily supported by the Energy Marketing
& Trading segment.

Corporate & Other

includes administrative and general
expenses, and interest
costs of DTE Energy corporate that have not been allocated to the regulated and
non-regulated businesses. Corporate & Other also includes various other
non-regulated operations, including investments in new emerging energy
technologies.

The income tax provisions or benefits of DTE Energy’s
subsidiaries are
determined on an individual company basis and recognize the tax benefit of
Section 29 tax credits and net operating losses. The subsidiaries record
income tax payable to or receivable from DTE Energy resulting from the
inclusion of its taxable income or loss in DTE Energy’s consolidated tax
return. Inter-segment revenues are not material. Financial data of the
business segments follows:

NOTE 17 SUPPLEMENTARY QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION
(UNAUDITED)

Quarterly earnings per share may not total for the years, since
quarterly
computations are based on weighted average common shares outstanding during
each quarter. In February 2003, we sold ITC which has been accounted for as a
discontinued operation (Note 3).

Accounting and Financial Disclosure
