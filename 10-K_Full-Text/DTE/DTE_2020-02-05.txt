ELECTRIC

Description

DTE Energy's Electric segment consists principally of DTE Electric, an electric utility engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity to approximately

2.2 million

customers in southeastern Michigan.  DTE Electric is regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC, the FERC, the NRC, the EPA, and EGLE.  Electricity is generated from fossil-fuel plants, a hydroelectric pumped storage plant, a nuclear plant, wind and other renewable assets and is supplemented with purchased power.  The electricity is sold, or distributed through the retail access program, to three major classes of customers: residential, commercial, and industrial, throughout southeastern Michigan.

Weather, economic factors, competition, energy waste reduction initiatives, and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers.  DTE Electric's peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year, driven by air conditioning and other cooling-related demands.  DTE Electric's operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of DTE Electric.

The Electric segment also consists of non-utility operations relating to renewable energy projects at DTE Sustainable Generation.  These projects have been acquired in support of DTE Energy's renewable energy goals.

See

Note 5

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Report, "

Revenue

."


Fuel Supply and Purchased Power

DTE Electric's power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power.  DTE Electric expects to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet its obligation to serve customers.  DTE Electric's generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal.  Coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms.  DTE Electric expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through long-term contracts, with the balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot purchases.  DTE Electric has long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase of approximately

22 million

tons of low-sulfur western coal and approximately

2 million

tons of Appalachian coal to be delivered from


to


.  All of these contracts have pricing schedules.  DTE Electric has approximately

99%

of the expected coal requirements for


under contract.  Given the geographic diversity of supply, DTE Electric believes it can meet its expected generation requirements.  DTE Electric leases a fleet of rail cars and has the expected western and eastern coal rail requirements under multi-year contracts.  The Company expects to cover all of its vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to electric generating facilities through new agreements.

DTE Electric participates in the energy market through MISO.  DTE Electric offers its generation in the market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve its load.  DTE Electric is a net purchaser of power that supplements its generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages.


Properties

DTE Electric owns generating facilities that are located in the State of Michigan.  Substantially all of DTE Electric's property is subject to the lien of a mortgage.

Generating facilities owned and in service as of

See "Capital Investments" in Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this Report for information regarding plant retirements and future capital expenditures.

DTE Electric owns and operates


distribution substations with a capacity of approximately

37,025,000

kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and approximately

445,200

line transformers with a capacity of approximately

32,392,000

kVA.

Circuit miles of electric distribution lines owned and in service as of

December 31, 2019

are shown in the following table:


There are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between DTE Electric and electricity providers external to the DTE Electric service area.  These interconnections are generally owned and operated by ITC Transmission, an unrelated company, and connect to neighboring energy companies.

Regulation

DTE Electric is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC, the FERC, and the NRC.  The MPSC issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting, and operating-related matters.  DTE Electric's MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on investments.  The FERC regulates DTE Electric with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities.  The NRC has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation, construction, licensing, and decommissioning of DTE Electric's nuclear plant operations.  DTE Electric is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment, and health.

," and "

Commitments and Contingencies

."

Energy Assistance Programs

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain critical to DTE Electric’s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses.  DTE Electric’s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded assistance that qualifying customers receive.  DTE Electric works continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of low-income individuals in the service territory.  DTE Electric also partners with federal, state, and local officials to attempt to increase the share of low-income funding allocated to customers.

Strategy and Competition

DTE Electric's electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a cost effective manner.  With potential capacity constraints in the MISO region, there will be increased dependency on DTE Electric's generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers.  This generation will require continuing investments in DTE Electric's primary coal generating units, nuclear generating plant, a natural gas fueled combined cycle generation facility, and renewables.

DTE Electric's distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe, cost effective, and reliable manner to customers.  DTE Electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to increase customer satisfaction at an affordable rate.

The electric retail access program in Michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers, subject to limits.  Customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10% of retail sales in


,


, and


and consisted primarily of industrial and commercial customers.  MPSC rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan have placed a 10% cap on the total retail access related migration, mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on DTE Electric's financial performance and full service customer rates.  Energy legislation passed in 2016 retained the 10% retail access cap with some revisions.  DTE Electric expects that customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10% of retail sales in


.

Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the on-site generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers.  DTE Electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term.

Revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions, economic factors, regulatory events, and other risk factors as discussed in the "Risk Factors" in Item 1A. of this Report.

GAS

Description

DTE Energy's Gas segment consists principally of DTE Gas, a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase, storage, transportation, distribution, and sale of natural gas to approximately

1.3 million

residential, commercial, and industrial customers throughout Michigan, and the sale of storage and transportation capacity.


DTE Gas' natural gas sales, end-user transportation, and intermediate transportation volumes, revenues, and Net Income, are impacted by weather.  Given the seasonal nature of the business, revenues and Net Income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year.  By the end of the first quarter, the heating season is largely over, and DTE Gas typically realizes substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter, and losses in the third quarter.  The impacts of changes in annual average customer usage are minimized by the RDM.

DTE Gas operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of DTE Gas.

See

Note 5

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Report, "

Revenue

."

Natural Gas Supply

DTE Gas' gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily send-out capacity of

2.5

Bcf, with approximately

68%

of the volume coming from underground storage for


.  Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, and purchased gas supplies.  Because of the geographic diversity of supply and its pipeline transportation and storage capacity, DTE Gas is able to reliably meet supply requirements.  DTE Gas believes natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future.

DTE Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and maintains a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts.  Supplier, producing region, quantity, and available transportation diversify DTE Gas' natural gas supply base.  Natural gas supply is obtained from various sources in different geographic areas (Appalachian, Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Canada, and Michigan) under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms.  Gas supply pricing is generally tied to the New York Mercantile Exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with MPSC-approved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through


.

DTE Gas is directly connected to interstate pipelines, providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the Appalachian, Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Canadian regions.  The primary long-term transportation supply contracts at

December 31, 2019

are listed below.

Properties

DTE Gas owns distribution, storage, and transportation properties that are located in the State of Michigan.  The distribution system includes approximately 20,000 miles of distribution mains, approximately 1,305,000 service pipelines, and approximately 1,285,000 active meters, and DTE Gas owns approximately 2,000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect DTE Gas storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas.

DTE Gas owns storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 139 Bcf.  These facilities are important in providing reliable and cost-effective service to DTE Gas customers.  In addition, DTE Gas sells storage services to third parties.

Most of DTE Gas' distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by DTE Gas through easements, permits, or licenses.  Substantially all of DTE Gas' property is subject to the lien of a mortgage.

DTE Gas leases a portion of its pipeline system to the Vector Pipeline Partnership (an affiliate) through a finance lease arrangement.  See

Note 18

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Report, "

Leases

."


Regulation

DTE Gas is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting, and operating-related matters.  DTE Gas' MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on investments.  DTE Gas operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in Michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the MPSC and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to a MPSC-approved tariff.

DTE Gas also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an Operating Statement on file with the FERC.  The FERC's jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates, non-discriminatory requirements, and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by DTE Gas in interstate markets.  FERC granted DTE Gas authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at market-based rates.  DTE Gas provides transportation services in interstate commerce at cost-based rates approved by the MPSC and filed with the FERC.

DTE Gas is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment, and health.

See

Notes 10 and 19

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, "

Regulatory Matters

" and "

Commitments and Contingencies

."

Energy Assistance Program

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain critical to DTE Gas' ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses.  DTE Gas' uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded assistance its qualifying customers receive.  DTE Gas works continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of low-income individuals in the service territory.  DTE Gas also partners with federal, state, and local officials to attempt to increase the share of low-income funding allocated to DTE Gas customers.

Strategy and Competition

DTE Gas' strategy is to ensure the safe, reliable, and cost effective delivery of natural gas service within its franchised markets in Michigan.  In addition, DTE Gas is promoting the extension of its distribution system to underserved markets and the increased use of natural gas furnaces, water heaters, and appliances within its current customer base.  DTE Gas continues to focus on the reduction of operating costs and the delivery of energy waste reduction products and services to its customers, making natural gas service the preferred fuel and even more affordable for its customers.

Competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers, as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources.  The primary focus of competition for end-user transportation is cost and reliability.  Some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal, electricity, oil, and steam.  If these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source, they would not have a need for DTE Gas' end-user transportation service.  DTE Gas competes against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service, supported by its storage capacity.

Having an extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled marketing of DTE Gas' storage and transportation services to gas producers, marketers, distribution companies, end-user customers, and other pipeline companies.  The business operates in a central geographic location with connections to major Midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the Midwest, eastern United States, and eastern Canada.

DTE Gas' storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to its customers and is also sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements.  Prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher, but more volatile, than for longer periods.  Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions, weather, and natural gas pricing.

GAS STORAGE AND PIPELINES

Description

Gas Storage and Pipelines owns natural gas storage fields, lateral and gathering pipeline systems, compression and surface facilities, and has ownership interests in interstate pipelines serving the Gulf Coast, Midwest, Ontario, and Northeast markets.  The pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported by long-term, fixed-price revenue contracts.


Properties

Gas Storage and Pipelines holds the following properties:

_______________________________________

(a)

LEAP, a 150-mile pipeline in Louisiana, is currently under construction.  DTE Energy is targeting completion in second half of 2020.

The assets of these businesses are well integrated with other DTE Energy operations.  Pursuant to an operating agreement, DTE Gas provides physical operations, maintenance, and technical support for the Washington 10 and 28 storage facilities and for the Michigan gathering systems.

Regulation

Gas Storage and Pipelines operates natural gas storage facilities in Michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the MPSC and provides intrastate storage and related services pursuant to an MPSC-approved tariff.  Gas Storage and Pipelines also provides interstate services in accordance with an Operating Statement on file with the FERC.  Vector, Millennium, Birdsboro, and NEXUS Pipelines provide interstate transportation services in accordance with their FERC-approved tariffs.  In addition, NEXUS and Vector are subject to applicable laws, rules, and regulations in Canada.  Gas Storage and Pipelines' gathering and pipeline assets are subject to the rules and regulations of various state utility commissions.

Strategy and Competition

Gas Storage and Pipelines expects to continue its steady growth plan by expanding existing assets and developing new assets that are typically supported with long-term customer commitments, particularly in the following regions:

Midwest to Northeast Region

Gas Storage and Pipelines will focus on opportunities to supply natural gas to meet growing demand and displace less attractive supply from certain regions in North America. Much of the growth in midstream services demand for natural gas is expected to occur in the eastern Canada and the northeast U.S. regions. Gas Storage and Pipelines believes that the Vector, Millennium, and NEXUS Pipelines are well-positioned to provide access routes and low-cost expansion options to these markets due to growth in production from the Marcellus/Utica Shales in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Gas Storage and Pipelines has agreements with key producers that support its Bluestone Pipeline, Susquehanna gathering, Tioga gathering, AGS,


and SGG businesses.  Gas Storage and Pipelines is evaluating new pipeline and storage investment opportunities that could include additional pipeline and gathering expansions, laterals, compression, and other Marcellus/Utica shale midstream development or partnering opportunities.

Gulf Coast Region

In December 2019, Gas Storage and Pipelines completed the acquisition of the Blue Union gathering system and LEAP gathering pipeline in the Haynesville shale formation of Louisiana which provide access to growing Gulf Coast markets.  The assets serve multiple markets, including Louisiana, the nation's third largest natural gas consumer, and the Gulf Coast where demand for natural gas is rapidly increasing in the power, industrial and LNG export sectors.  Furthermore, they are strategically located to meet this increasing demand given their proximity and access to multiple major downstream pipelines with bi-directional capability.  Through this acquisition, Gas Storage and Pipeline invested in economically strong and strategically situated assets that are supported by long-term contracts.  Strong credit provisions are also incorporated into the contract with the system's largest customer.

Gas Storage and Pipelines has competition from other pipelines and storage providers.  Operations are dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of Gas Storage and Pipelines.

•

Reduced Emissions Fuel —

Power and Industrial Projects has constructed and placed in service REF facilities at ten sites including facilities located at seven third-party owned coal-fired power plants.  DTE Energy has sold membership interests in five of the facilities and entered into lease arrangements in two of the facilities.  The facilities blend a proprietary additive with coal used in coal-fired power plants, resulting in reduced emissions of nitrogen oxide and mercury.  Qualifying facilities are eligible to generate tax credits for ten years upon achieving certain criteria.  The value of a tax credit is adjusted annually by an inflation factor published by the IRS.  The value of the tax credit is reduced if the reference price of coal exceeds certain thresholds.  The economic benefit of the REF facilities is dependent upon the generation of production tax credits.

Properties and Other

The following are significant properties operated by Power and Industrial Projects:

Regulation

Certain electric generating facilities within Power and Industrial Projects have market-based rate authority from the FERC to sell power.  The facilities are subject to FERC reporting requirements and market behavior rules.  Certain projects of Power and Industrial Projects are also subject to the applicable laws, rules, and regulations related to the EPA, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, DOE, and various state utility commissions.

ENERGY TRADING

Description

Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power, natural gas and environmental marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions.  Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power, environmental and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers’ behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers.  Energy Trading's customer base is predominantly utilities, local distribution companies, pipelines, producers and generators, and other marketing and trading companies.  Energy Trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within DTE Energy.

Energy Trading enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its marketing and hedging activities.  These financial instruments are generally accounted for under the MTM method, which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives.  Energy Trading utilizes forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with marketing and trading activity, as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines.

Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged.  Most financial instruments, physical power and natural gas contracts, and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives; whereas, natural gas and environmental inventory, contracts for pipeline transportation, storage assets, and some environmental contracts are not derivatives.  As a result, this segment will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets.  The business’ strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps, and options.  This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods.

Regulation

Energy Trading has market-based rate authority from the FERC to sell power and blanket authority from the FERC to sell natural gas at market prices.  Energy Trading is subject to FERC reporting requirements and market behavior rules.  Energy Trading is also subject to the applicable laws, rules, and regulations related to the CFTC, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and DOE.  In addition, Energy Trading is subject to applicable laws, rules, and regulations in Canada.


Strategy and Competition

DTE Energy's strategy for the Energy Trading business is to deliver value-added services to DTE Energy customers.  DTE Energy seeks to manage this business in a manner complementary to the growth of DTE Energy's other business segments.  Energy Trading focuses on physical marketing and the optimization of its portfolio of energy assets.  The segment competes with electric and gas marketers, financial institutions, traders, utilities, and other energy providers.  The Energy Trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating.  DTE Energy believes it has ample available capital capacity to support Energy Trading activities.  DTE Energy monitors its use of capital closely to ensure that its commitments do not exceed capacity.  A material credit restriction would negatively impact Energy Trading's financial performance.  Competitors with greater access to capital, or at a lower cost, may have a competitive advantage.  DTE Energy has risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Description

Corporate and Other includes various holding company activities, holds certain non-utility debt, and holds energy-related investments.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers.  The following table summarizes DTE Energy's, including DTE Electric's, estimated significant future environmental expenditures based upon current regulations.  Pending or future reconsiderations of current regulations may impact the estimated expenditures summarized in the table below.  Actual costs to comply could vary substantially.  Additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented.

Water

— The EPA finalized regulations on cooling water intake in August 2014.  DTE Electric is conducting studies to determine the best technology for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at each of its facilities.  DTE Electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the cooling water intakes.

Contaminated and Other Sites

— Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke, or oil.  The facilities, which produced gas, have been designated as MGP sites.  DTE Gas owns, or previously owned, 14 such former MGP sites.  DTE Electric owns, or previously owned, three former MGP sites.  DTE Energy anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the MPSC for DTE Gas, which allows DTE Gas to amortize the MGP costs over a ten-year period beginning with the subsequent year the MGP costs were incurred, will prevent the associated investigation and remediation costs from having a material adverse effect on DTE Energy's operations.  DTE Electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site.

The Registrants are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations.  These other sites include an engineered ash storage facility, electric distribution substations, gas pipelines, electric generating power plants, and underground and aboveground storage tank locations.  Cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years.  Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the Registrants' financial position and cash flows and the rates charged to their customers.


Coal Combustion Residuals and Effluent Limitations Guidelines

— A final EPA rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals, commonly known as coal ash, became effective in October 2015, and was revised in October 2016 and July 2018.  The rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a non-hazardous waste and relies on various self-implementation design and performance standards.  DTE Electric owns and operates

three

permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coal-fired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants subject to certain provisions in the CCR rule.  At certain facilities, the rule currently requires the installation of monitoring wells, compliance with groundwater standards, and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant.  At other facilities, the rule requires ash laden waters be moved from earthen basins to steel and concrete tanks.  DTE Electric has estimated the impact of the current rule to be

$608 million

.

On December 2, 2019, a proposed revision to the CCR Rule was published in the Federal Register to address the D.C. Circuit’s 2018 decision regarding CCR impoundments that are not lined with an engineered liner system.  The rule proposes that all CCR impoundments that do not meet the engineered liner requirements must close by specific dates, and it further confirms that all clay lined impoundments are viewed as unlined.  The EPA is also preparing a rule making that is expected to be proposed early in 2020 that will provide mechanisms to determine if certain alternative liner systems may be as protective as the current liners specified in the CCR rule.  DTE Electric is currently evaluating options based on the range of outcomes of the current proposed rule and the anticipated proposed rule to determine any changes to DTE Electric's plans in the operation and closure of coal ash impoundments.

In November 2015, the EPA finalized effluent limitations guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry which requires additional controls to be installed between 2018 and 2023.  The initial costs to comply with this rule are under development and estimates are included in the Coal Combustion Residual and Effluent Limitations Guidelines amount in the above table.

On April 12, 2017, the EPA granted a petition for reconsideration of the ELG Rule.  The EPA also signed an administrative stay of the ELG Rule’s compliance deadlines for fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater, among others.  On June 6, 2017, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule to postpone certain applicable deadlines within the ELG rule.  The final rule was published on September 18, 2017.  The final rule nullified the administrative stay but also extended the earliest compliance deadlines for the FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water until November 1, 2020 in order for the EPA to propose and finalize a new ruling.  On November 22, 2019, the EPA issued a proposed rule to revise the technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards applicable to flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water.  The ELG compliance requirements and final deadlines for bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater, and total ELG related compliance costs will not be known until the EPA completes its reconsideration of the ELG Rule.

Air

— DTE Electric is subject to the EPA ozone and fine particulate transport, and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of SO


and NO

X

.  The EPA and the State of Michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze, mercury, and other air pollution.  These rules have led to emission controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce SO


, NO

X

, mercury, and other emissions.  These rulemakings could require additional controls for SO


, NO

X

, and other hazardous air pollutants over the next few years.  DTE Electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures will be necessary to comply with air pollution requirements through


, subject to the results of future rulemakings.

The EPA has implemented regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act to address emissions of GHGs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy.  Among these actions, the EPA has finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing fossil-fuel EGUs.  In 2019 the performance standards for existing EGUs (also known as the Clean Power Plan) were officially repealed and replaced by the ACE Rule.  The ACE Rule requires the state of Michigan to submit a plan in 2022 that includes GHG standards for existing coal-fired power plant units in Michigan.  These final rules do not impact DTE Energy's revised commitment to reduce carbon emissions

32%

by the early 2020s,

50%

by 2030, and

80%

by 2040, or its goal of net

zero

emissions by 2050 for DTE Electric, from the 2005 carbon emissions levels.

Pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on DTE Electric's operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers.  Impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the purchase of emission credits from market sources, higher costs of purchased power, and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical.  DTE Electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers, as authorized by the MPSC.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

There are various risks associated with the operations of the Registrants' utility businesses and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Registrants, below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses.  Although the Registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect performance.

The Registrants are subject to rate regulation.

Electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  The Registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC, or other regulatory bodies.  The Registrants' ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations.  Regulators may also disagree with the Registrants' rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business.  If the Registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact the Registrants' ability to recover certain costs through customer rates.  Regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for the Registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers.  The Registrants cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases.  New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses.

Changes to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance.

The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan, have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.

The Registrants' electric distribution system and DTE Energy's gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation, which could reduce revenues, increase expenses, and have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, and results of operations.

The Registrants' electric distribution and DTE Energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks.  These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years.  Equipment, even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants' control, and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently.  Because the Registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of the Registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.

DTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations.

DTE Energy relies on non-utility operations for an increasing portion of earnings.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments, including the acquisition of midstream natural gas assets in December 2019, do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value.


DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.

DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.

The Registrants' businesses have safety risks.

The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.

Environmental laws and liability may be costly.

The Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.

Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and, for DTE Energy's gas distribution businesses.  These laws and regulations require the Registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals.  The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations.  Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.

The Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.

For DTE Energy, future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques, including hydraulic fracturing, being discussed both at the United States federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for, and profitability of, DTE Energy's gas transportation businesses.

Threats of cyber incidents, physical security, and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business.

Issues may threaten the Registrants such as cyber incidents, physical security, or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations, and could harm the Registrants' operating results.

Information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, and data security breaches.

The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure.  All of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents, physical security threats, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes, as well as loss of operational control of the Registrants' electric generation and distribution assets and, DTE Energy's gas distribution assets.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.

Suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support the Registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data.  A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system.  Also

, because the Registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the Registrants’ businesses, operating results, and financial condition.


In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities, and DTE Energy's gas pipeline and storage facilities in particular, may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict.

Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.

In connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise, could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.

Construction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities, DTE Energy's distribution systems and its Gas Storage and Pipelines business subject them to risk.

The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at the Registrants' multiple power generation and distribution facilities, at DTE Energy's gas distribution system, and at DTE Energy's Gas Storage and Pipelines business.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns, and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects.

Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.

Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options.  A specific example of increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements is DTE Electric having an open Confirmatory Action Letter with the NRC to complete specific mitigation actions during the next periodic outage in 2020 and that DTE Electric will not bring the plant back on line until it is completed.  Insurance maintained by the Registrants for various nuclear-related risks may not be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, the Registrants' nuclear decommissioning trust fund, to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.  A decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations.  Any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the Registrants’ liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.

The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions, and changes in transportation costs, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas, and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants' hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants' financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.  The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers as well as midstream services that depend on the demand for natural gas.

The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results

.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses.


Emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants

.  Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include cost-effective renewable energy technologies, distributed generation, energy waste reduction technologies, and energy storage devices.  Such developments may impact the price of energy, may affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and could make portions of our electric system power supply and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.  Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.

Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.

Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity.

Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.

The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  If interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.

The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.

The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the Registrants' ability, as well as the ability of their subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until


, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.

DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.

Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.


Weather significantly affects operations.

At both utilities, deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  DTE Gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues.

Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.

Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.

Regional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.

The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.

Renewable portfolio standards and energy waste reduction may affect the Registrants' business and federal and state fuel standards may affect DTE Energy's non-utility investments.

The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy.  The Registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future.  In addition, the Registrants expect to comply with new Michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.

In addition, the Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results.

DTE Energy's non-utility renewable natural gas investments are also dependent on the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard.  Changes to these standards may affect DTE Energy's business and result in lower earnings.

Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants

’

operations.

The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the Registrants have an aging utility workforce, and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations.

A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants.

There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately

5,300

and DTE Electric's approximately

2,800

represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in


and


.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.


DTE Energy's ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.

To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  The Registrants generated production tax credits from renewable energy generation and DTE Energy generated production tax credits from renewable gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, and gas production operations.  If the Registrants' production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit or changes in tax law, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.

If DTE Energy's goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.

DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Goodwill and other intangible assets are also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower industry growth rates, or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery.  If the carrying value of any goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be not recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.

The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.

The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters, war, terrorism, cyber incidents, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following combined discussion is separately filed by DTE Energy and DTE Electric.  However, DTE Electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to DTE Energy or the subsidiaries of DTE Energy other than itself.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

DTE Energy is a diversified energy company with


Operating Revenues of approximately

$12.7 billion

and Total Assets of approximately

$41.9 billion

.  DTE Energy is the parent company of DTE Electric and DTE Gas, regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales, distribution, and storage services throughout Michigan.  DTE Energy operates three energy-related non-utility segments with operations throughout the United States.

The following table summarizes DTE Energy's financial results:

The

increase

in


Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company

was primarily due to higher earnings in the Electric and Gas segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power and Industrial Projects segments.  The

decrease

in


Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company

was primarily due to lower earnings in the Gas Storage and Pipelines, Energy Trading, and Corporate and Other segments, partially offset by higher earnings in the Electric, Gas, and Power and Industrial Projects segments.  The


decrease

was primarily due to higher Income Tax Expense, as 2017 included a one-time net income tax benefit of $105 million related to the enactment of the TCJA.

Please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following "Results of Operations" section.

DTE Energy's strategy is to achieve long-term earnings growth, a strong balance sheet, and an attractive dividend yield.


DTE Energy's utilities are investing capital to improve customer reliability through investments in base infrastructure and new generation, and to comply with environmental requirements.  DTE Energy expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth.  DTE Energy is focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability.  DTE Energy operates in a constructive regulatory environment and has solid relationships with its regulators.

In March 2019, DTE Energy announced updated plans for accelerating its reduction of carbon emissions to 32% by the early 2020s, 50% by 2030, and 80% by 2040 from the 2005 carbon emissions levels.  In September 2019, DTE Energy expanded on its commitment by announcing a net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 for DTE Electric.  To achieve the reduction goals in the near term, DTE Energy will transition away from coal-powered sources and incorporate more renewable energy, energy waste reduction projects, demand response, and natural gas fueled generation.  DTE Energy has already begun the transition in the way it produces power through the continued retirement of its aging coal-fired plants.  Refer to the "Capital Investments" section below for further discussion.

DTE Energy has significant investments in non-utility businesses.  DTE Energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets, skills, and expertise, and provides diversity in earnings and geography.  Specifically, DTE Energy invests in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile.  DTE Energy expects growth opportunities in the Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power and Industrial Projects segments.

A key priority for DTE Energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced short-term and long-term financing.  Near-term growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity.  DTE Energy has an enterprise risk management program that, among other things, is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes, interest rates, and counterparty credit risk.

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

DTE Energy's utility businesses require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements.

DTE Electric's capital investments over the

2020-2024

period are estimated at

$12.0 billion

comprised of

$4.0 billion

for capital replacements and other projects,

$5.0 billion

for distribution infrastructure, and

$3.0 billion

for new generation.  DTE Electric has retired five coal-fired generation units at the Trenton Channel, River Rouge, and St. Clair facilities and has announced plans to retire its remaining twelve coal-fired generating units.  Six of these coal-fired generating units will be retired through 2022 at the Trenton Channel, River Rouge, and St. Clair facilities.  The remaining coal-fired generating units at the Belle River and Monroe facilities are expected to be retired by 2040.  The retired facilities will be replaced with renewables, energy waste reduction, demand response, and natural gas fueled generation.

DTE Gas' capital investments over the

2020-2024

period are estimated at

$3.0 billion

comprised of

$1.4 billion

for base infrastructure, and

$1.6 billion

for gas main renewal, meter move out, and pipeline integrity programs.

DTE Electric and DTE Gas plan to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with ratemaking treatment.

DTE Energy's non-utility businesses' capital investments are primarily for expansion, growth, and ongoing maintenance.  Gas Storage and Pipelines' capital investments over the

2020-2024

period are estimated at

$2.2 billion

to

$2.7 billion

for gathering and pipeline investments and expansions.  Power and Industrial Projects' capital investments over the

2020-2024

period are estimated at

$1.0 billion

to

$1.4 billion

for industrial energy services and RNG projects.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulations.  Additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented.  Actual costs to comply could vary substantially.  The Registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers, as authorized by the MPSC.


Air

— DTE Electric is subject to the EPA ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of SO


and NO

X

.  The EPA and the State of Michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze, mercury, and other air pollution.  These rules have led to controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce SO


, NO

X

, mercury, and other emissions.  Additional rulemakings may occur over the next few years which could require additional controls for SO


, NO

X

, and other hazardous air pollutants.  To comply with existing requirements, DTE Electric spent approximately

$2.4 billion

through


.  DTE Electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures through


, pending the results of future rulemakings.

The EPA has implemented regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act to address emissions of GHGs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy.  Among these actions, in 2015 the EPA finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing fossil-fuel EGUs.  In 2019 the performance standards for existing EGUs (also known as the Clean Power Plan) were officially repealed and replaced by the ACE Rule.  The ACE Rule requires the state of Michigan to submit a plan in 2022 that includes GHG standards for existing coal-fired power plant units in Michigan.  It is not possible to determine the potential impact of the EPA's ACE rule on existing sources at this time.

Pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on DTE Electric's operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers.  Impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the purchase of emission credits from market sources, higher costs of purchased power, and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical.  DTE Electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers, as authorized by the MPSC.

Increased costs for energy produced from traditional coal-based sources due to recent, pending, and future regulatory initiatives, could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable, natural gas fueled generation, and/or nuclear sources, energy waste reduction initiatives, and the potential development of market-based trading of carbon instruments which could provide new business opportunities for DTE Energy's utility and non-utility segments.  At the present time, it is not possible to quantify the financial impacts of these climate related regulatory initiatives on the Registrants or their customers.

See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties and

Note 19

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, "

Commitments and Contingencies

," for further discussion of Environmental Matters.

OUTLOOK

The next few years will be a period of rapid change for DTE Energy and for the energy industry.  DTE Energy's strong utility base, combined with its integrated non-utility operations, position it well for long-term growth.

Looking forward, DTE Energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance:

•

electric and gas customer satisfaction;

•

electric distribution system reliability;

•

new electric generation;

•

gas distribution system renewal;

•

rate competitiveness and affordability;

•

regulatory stability and investment recovery for the electric and gas utilities;

•

employee safety and engagement;

•

cost structure optimization across all business segments;

•

cash, capital, and liquidity to maintain or improve financial strength; and

•

investments that integrate assets and leverage skills and expertise.

DTE Energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic, financial, and risk criteria.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as the non-GAAP financial measures, Utility Margin and Non-utility Margin, discussed below, which DTE Energy uses as measures of its operational performance.  Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

DTE Energy uses Utility Margin and Non-utility Margin, non-GAAP financial measures, to assess its performance by reportable segment.

Utility Margin includes electric utility and gas utility Operating Revenues net of Fuel, purchased power, and gas expenses.  The utilities’ fuel, purchased power, and natural gas supply are passed through to customers, and therefore, result in changes to the utilities’ revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses.  As such, DTE Energy believes Utility Margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the utilities’ operations across periods, as it excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses.  For the Electric segment, non-utility Operating Revenues are reported separately so that Utility Margin can be used to assess utility performance.

The Non-utility Margin relates to the Power and Industrial Projects and Energy Trading segments.  For the Power and Industrial Projects segment, Non-utility Margin primarily includes Operating Revenues net of Fuel, purchased power, and gas expenses.  Operating Revenues include sales of refined coal to third parties and the affiliated Electric utility, metallurgical coke and related by-products, petroleum coke, renewable natural gas, and electricity, as well as rental income and revenues from utility-type consulting, management, and operational services.  For the Energy Trading segment, Non-utility Margin includes revenue and realized and unrealized gains and losses from physical and financial power and gas marketing, optimization, and trading activities, net of Purchased power and gas related to these activities.  DTE Energy evaluates its operating performance of these non-utility businesses using the measure of Operating Revenues net of Fuel, purchased power, and gas expenses.

Utility Margin and Non-utility Margin are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the results of operations presented in accordance with GAAP.  Utility Margin and Non-utility Margin do not intend to represent operating income, the most comparable GAAP measure, as an indicator of operating performance and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of DTE Energy's segments.  Segment information, described below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses, and other income and deductions that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ELECTRIC

The Results of Operations discussion for DTE Electric is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction I (2) (a) of Form 10-K for wholly-owned subsidiaries.


The Electric segment consists principally of DTE Electric.  Electric results are discussed below:

See DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Operations in Item 8 of this Report for a complete view of its results.  Differences between the Electric segment and DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Operations are primarily due to the classification of certain benefit costs.  Refer to

Note 21

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Retirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets

" for additional information.

Utility Margin

increased

$91 million

in


and

$98 million

in


.  Revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The following table details changes in various Utility Margin components relative to the comparable prior period:


______________________________

(a)

Represents power that is not distributed by DTE Electric.

(b)

Represents deliveries for self-generators that have purchased power from alternative energy suppliers to supplement their power requirements.

DTE Electric changes in sales for residential, commercial, and industrial are primarily due to less favorable weather in 2019 compared to 2018.

Operating Revenues — Non-utility operations

increased

$5 million

in


due to renewable energy projects acquired by DTE Sustainable Generation in September 2019.

Operation and maintenance

expense

decreased

$3 million

in


and

increased

$55 million

in


.  The

decrease

in


was primarily due to decreased uncollectible expense of $19 million and decreased generation expense of $3 million, partially offset by higher tree trim expense of $20 million (tree trim expenses increased by $63 million but were offset by amounts deferred to a regulatory asset of $43 million).  The

increase

in


was primarily due to increased uncollectible expense of $34 million due to customer billing initiatives following implementation of the new billing system, increased power plant generation expense of $24 million, an increase in energy waste reduction expense of $10 million to meet higher energy savings targets, partially offset by decreased distribution operations expense of $13 million.

Depreciation and amortization

expense

increased

$113 million

in


and

$83 million

in


.  In


, the

increase

was primarily due to a $124 million increase resulting from a higher depreciable base and change in depreciation rates effective May 2019, a $6 million increase associated with the RPS and a $4 million increase resulting from new non-utility assets at DTE Sustainable Generation, partially offset by a decrease of $17 million associated with the TRM.  In


, the

increase

was primarily due to an increase to depreciable base of $46 million and an increase of $42 million associated with the TRM, partially offset by a decrease in regulatory asset amortization of $5 million.

Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net

increased

$14 million

in


and decreased

$1 million

in


.  In


, the increase was primarily due to previously recorded capital expenditures of $13 million that were disallowed in the May 2, 2019 rate order.

Other (Income) and Deductions

decreased

$26 million

in


and

increased

$26 million

in


.  The

decrease

in


was primarily due to a change in investment earnings (gain of $37 million in 2019 compared to a loss of $11 million in 2018) and lower non-operating retirement benefits expense of $12 million, partially offset by higher interest expense of $32 million.   The

increase

in


was primarily due to higher interest expense of $9 million and change in investment earnings (loss of $11 million in 2018 compared to a gain of $26 million in 2017), partially offset by decreased non-operating retirement benefits expense of $13 million and a contribution to the DTE Energy Foundation of $7 million in 2017.

Income Tax Expense

decreased

$56 million

in


and

$128 million

in


.  The

decrease

in


was primarily due to TCJA regulatory liability amortization of $35 million and higher production tax credits in 2019.  The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to the reduction in the federal tax rate in the TCJA that was enacted in December 2017.


Outlook

—

DTE Electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustain strong cash flows, and earn its authorized return on equity.  DTE Electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth.  DTE Electric will maintain a strong focus on customers by increasing reliability and satisfaction while keeping customer rate increases affordable.  Looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather, the outcome of regulatory proceedings, benefit plan design changes, investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs, uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change, and effects of energy waste reduction programs.

DTE Electric filed a rate case with the MPSC on July 8, 2019 requesting an increase in base rates of

$351 million

based on a projected twelve-month period ending April 30, 2021.  The requested increase in base rates is primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure and generation investments.  The rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from

10.0%

to

10.5%

and includes projected changes in sales and operating and maintenance expenses.  A final MPSC order in this case is expected by May 2020.  Refer to

Note 10

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Regulatory Matters

" for additional information.

GAS

The Gas segment consists principally of DTE Gas.  Gas results are discussed below:

Utility Margin

increased

$65 million

in


and

$45 million

in


.  Revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The following table details changes in various Utility Margin components relative to the comparable prior period:


Operation and maintenance

expense

increased

$13 million

in


and

$53 million

in


.  The

increase

in


was primarily due to higher gas operations expenses of

$22 million

, which included higher pipeline integrity and other operating costs, and higher customer service costs of

$4 million

, partially offset by decreased uncollectible expense of

$14 million

.  The

increase

in


was primarily due to increased uncollectible expense of

$28 million

due to customer billing initiatives following implementation of a new customer billing system and higher gas operations expenses of

$22 million

, which included increased investment spending and higher pipeline integrity expenses.

Depreciation and amortization

expense

increased

$11 million

in


and

$10 million

in


.  The

increase

in both periods was primarily due to increases in depreciable base.

Other (Income) and Deductions

increased

$4 million

in


and

decreased

$19 million

in


.  The

increase

in


was primarily due to higher interest expense of $8 million, partially offset by lower contributions to the DTE Energy Foundation and other not-for-profit organizations of $6 million.  The

decrease

in


was primarily due to lower contributions to the DTE Energy Foundation and other not-for-profit organizations of $27 million, partially offset by higher interest expense of $6 million.

Income Tax Expense

decreased

$5 million

in


and

$11 million

in


.  The

decrease

in


was primarily due to the absence of a $10 million TCJA expense recorded in 2018, partially offset by increased tax expense on higher earnings in 2019.  The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to the reduction in the federal tax rate in the TCJA that was enacted in December 2017, partially offset by a $10 million TCJA expense and the absence of the $7 million favorable depreciation tax benefit that ended in 2017.

Outlook —

DTE Gas will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustain strong cash flows, and earn its authorized return on equity.  DTE Gas expects that planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth.  Looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather, the outcome of regulatory proceedings, benefit plan design changes, and investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs.  DTE Gas expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability.


DTE Gas filed a rate case with the MPSC on November 25, 2019 requesting an increase in base rates of

$204 million

based on a projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2021.  The requested increase in base rates is primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure investments and operating and maintenance expenses.  The rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from

10.0%

to

10.5%

and includes projected changes in sales and working capital.  A final MPSC order in this case is expected by September 2020.

GAS STORAGE AND PIPELINES

The Gas Storage and Pipelines segment consists of the non-utility gas pipelines and storage businesses.  Gas Storage and Pipelines results are discussed below:

Operating Revenues — Non-utility operations

increased

$16 million

in


and

$32 million

in


.  The

increase

in both periods was primarily due to higher pipeline and gathering revenues, partially offset by lower physical sales of gas from AGS customers and lower storage revenues.  The 2019 increase includes the acquisition of Blue Union in December 2019 and the first full year of Birdsboro Pipeline operations.

Cost of gas — Non-utility

decreased

$4 million

in


and

$8 million

in


.  The

decrease

in both periods was driven primarily by lower physical purchases of gas from AGS customers.

Operation and maintenance

expense

increased

$17 million

in


and

$20 million

in


.  The


increase

was primarily due to transaction costs associated with the Blue Union and LEAP acquisition and higher labor related expenses.  The


increase

was primarily due to higher labor related expenses and additional compression activity on the Bluestone Pipeline and Susquehanna gathering systems.

Depreciation and amortization

expense

increased

$12 million

in


and

$6 million

in


.  The


increase

was primarily due to additional pipeline and gathering assets placed into service during the year.

Other (Income) and Deductions

decreased

$27 million

in


and

increased

$43 million

in


.  The


decrease

was primarily due to lower earnings from pipeline investments and higher interest expense.  The


increase

was primarily due to higher earnings from pipeline investments and a $16 million net loss on extinguishment of debt within the storage business in 2017, partially offset by higher interest expense.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

increased

$6 million

in


and

$98 million

in


.  The 2018 increase was primarily driven by the $115 million remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

decreased

$12 million

in


and

increased

$1 million

in


.  The


decrease

was primarily due to the May 2019 purchase of an additional 30% ownership interest in SGG.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, "Acquisitions", for discussion of the acquisition of Blue Union and LEAP in December 2019.


Outlook —

Significant expansion activities are underway to increase capacity of the Blue Union and LEAP assets, which provide natural gas gathering and other midstream services to producers located primarily in Louisiana.

DTE Energy believes its long-term agreements with producers and the quality of the natural gas reserves in the Marcellus/Utica and Haynesville shale regions soundly position the business for future growth.  Gas Storage and Pipelines will continue to execute quality investments, with a focus on continued organic growth from well-positioned existing assets.

POWER AND INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS

The Power and Industrial Projects segment is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utility-type products and services to industrial, commercial, and institutional customers, produce reduced emissions fuel, and sell electricity and pipeline-quality gas from renewable energy projects.  Power and Industrial Projects results are discussed below:

Operating Revenues — Non-utility operations

decreased

Outlook —

In December 2019, Power and Industrial Projects signed an agreement with South Jersey Industries (“SJI”) to purchase an 8 MW combined heat and power generation facility that provides electricity and hot and chilled water to a hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  The acquisition had a purchase price of $100 million and is expected to close in early 2020.

Power and Industrial Projects will continue to leverage its extensive energy-related operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy and renewable natural gas projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers in addition to optimizing the REF facilities until the phase out at the end of 2021.


ENERGY TRADING

Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power, natural gas and environmental marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions.  Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power, environmental and related services, which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers' behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers.  Energy Trading results are discussed below:

Operating Revenues — Non-utility operations

and

Purchased power and gas — non-utility

decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower gas prices and increased in 2018 primarily due to higher volumes and higher gas prices, primarily in the gas structured strategy.

Non-utility Margin

increased

$15 million

in


and

decreased

_______________________________________

(a)

Natural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future and/or natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related non-derivative pipeline transportation contract.  These gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are marked-to-market without revaluing the related non-derivative contracts.

(b)

Outlook —

In the near-term, Energy Trading expects market conditions to remain challenging.  The profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with regulatory changes, and changes in operating rules of RTOs.  Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged.  Most financial instruments, physical power and natural gas contracts, and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives; whereas, natural gas and environmental inventory, contracts for pipeline transportation, storage assets, and some environmental contracts are not derivatives.  As a result, Energy Trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets.  Energy Trading's strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps, and options.  This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Cash Requirements

DTE Energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities, to grow the non-utility businesses, to retire and pay interest on long-term debt, and to pay dividends.  DTE Energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements.  DTE Energy expects that cash from operations in


will be approximately

$3.0 billion

.  DTE Energy anticipates base level utility capital investments, including environmental, renewable, and energy waste reduction expenditures; expenditures for non-utility businesses; and contributions to equity method investees in


of approximately

$4.5 billion

.  DTE Energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment.  Capital spending for growth of existing or new non-utility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict risk-return and value creation criteria.

Cash from Operating Activities

A majority of DTE Energy's operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities, which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather, electric retail access, regulatory deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions, changes in working capital, and operating costs.

Net cash from operations

decreased

$31 million

in


.  The

reduction

is primarily due to a decrease in cash from working capital items, partially offset by an increase in non-cash and non-operating items, primarily Deferred income taxes and Depreciation and amortization.

Net cash from operations

increased

$563 million

in


.  The

increase

in operating cash flows reflects an increase in adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items, primarily Depreciation and amortization and working capital adjustments, partially offset by a decrease to Deferred income taxes.

The change in working capital items in


was primarily related to an increase in cash used for Accounts payable and Other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities, partially offset by cash received related to Accounts receivable, Accrued pension and postretirement costs, and Regulatory assets and liabilities.  The change in working capital items in


primarily related to increases in cash from Accounts receivable, Accrued pension liability, Derivative assets and liabilities, and Other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities, partially offset by increases of cash used for Equity earnings of equity method investees, Prepaid postretirement benefit costs, Accrued postretirement liability, and Regulatory assets and liabilities.

Cash used for Investing Activities

Cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions.  In any given year, DTE Energy looks to realize cash from under-performing or non-strategic assets or matured, fully valued assets.

Capital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements.


Capital spending within the non-utility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance, expansion, and growth.  DTE Energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks, and returns.  All new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis.  DTE Energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria.  For new business lines, DTE Energy initially invests based on research and analysis.  DTE Energy starts with a limited investment, evaluates the results, and either expands or exits the business based on those results.  In any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of DTE Energy, with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings.

Net cash

used for

investing activities

increased

$2.4 billion

in


due primarily to DTE Energy's acquisitions of midstream natural gas assets and renewable energy projects of

$2.5 billion

, net of cash acquired of

$62 million

as described in

Note 4

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, "

Acquisitions

," as well as an increase in Plant and equipment expenditures, partially offset by a reduction in Contributions to equity method investees.

Net cash

used for

investing activities

increased

$785 million

in


due primarily to an increase in Plant and equipment expenditures and Contributions to equity method investees, principally to NEXUS.

Cash from Financing Activities

DTE Energy relies on both short-term borrowing and long-term financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations.

DTE Energy's strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity.  DTE Energy targets balance sheet financial metrics to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating.

Net cash

from

financing activities

increased

$2.4 billion

in


.  The

increase

was primarily due to an increase in Issuances of long-term debt, equity units, common stock, and Short-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase in Redemptions of long-term debt and Purchases of noncontrolling interests, principally related to SGG.  The increased issuances in 2019 were primarily related to the acquisition of midstream natural gas assets.  See details disclosed in the "Acquisition Financing" section of

Note 15

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. of this Report, "

Long-Term Debt

."

Net cash

from

financing activities

increased

$233 million

in


.  The

increase

was primarily due to the reduction of Redemption of long-term debt and Repurchases of common stock and an increase in Issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in cash used for repayments of Short-term borrowings and an increase in Dividends on common stock.

Outlook

DTE Energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the long-term, primarily as a result of growth from the utility and non-utility businesses.  Growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending which will increase the base from which rates are determined.  Non-utility growth is expected from additional investments, primarily in the Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power and Industrial Projects segments.

DTE Energy may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of MPSC orders.  Energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future.  DTE Energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of long-term capital projects.

DTE Energy has approximately

$687 million

in long-term debt, including finance leases, maturing in the next twelve months.  The repayment of the debt is expected to be paid through internally generated funds or the issuance of long-term debt.

DTE Energy has approximately

$1.6 billion

of available liquidity at

December 31, 2019

, consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements.

DTE Energy expects to issue equity up to

$300 million

in


.  At the discretion of management, and depending upon financial market conditions, DTE Energy anticipates up to

$185 million

of these equity issuances will be made through contributions to the qualified pension plans, including

$160 million

of DTE Electric contributions.  DTE Energy does not anticipate making any contributions to the other postretirement plans in


.  Any additional equity issuances are expected to be made through other employee benefit plans.


Various subsidiaries and equity investees of DTE Energy have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by DTE Energy.  These contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that DTE Energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE Energy's credit rating is downgraded below investment grade.  Certain of these provisions (known as "hard triggers") state specific circumstances under which DTE Energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as "soft triggers") are not as specific.  For contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which DTE Energy may ultimately be required to post.  The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily natural gas, power, and coal) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions.  As of

December 31, 2019

, DTE Energy's contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was

$527 million

.

DTE Energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility, cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs.  However, virtually all DTE Energy's businesses are capital intensive, or require access to capital, and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows.

DTE Energy may contribute more than the minimum funding requirements for the pension plans and may also make contributions to the other postretirement benefit plans; however, these amounts are not included in the table above as such amounts are discretionary.  Planned funding levels are disclosed in the "Capital Resources and Liquidity" and "Critical Accounting Estimates" sections herein and in

Note 21

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities.  DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing, as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets.  DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets.  However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors.

As part of the normal course of business, DTE Electric, DTE Gas, and various non-utility subsidiaries of DTE Energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal, capacity, storage, and other energy-related products and services.  Certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that DTE Energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade.  The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial.  Also, upon a downgrade below investment grade, DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market, and if DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade, the non-utility businesses, especially the Energy Trading and Power and Industrial Projects segments, could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity.  A downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets.  The impact of a downgrade will not affect DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' ability to comply with existing debt covenants.  While DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade, they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews.


In October 2019, Moody's Investors Service downgraded DTE Energy's unsecured debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2 following DTE Energy's announcement to acquire midstream natural gas assets.  Refer to

Note 4

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Acquisitions

," for additional information.  We do not expect the downgrade to negatively impact DTE Energy's liquidity or access to the capital markets.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Registrants' management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.  Additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Regulation

A significant portion of the Registrants' businesses are subject to regulation.  This results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses.  DTE Electric and DTE Gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses.  Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants' management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment.

See

Note 10

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, "

Regulatory Matters

."

Derivatives

Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative assets or liabilities.  Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change.  The normal purchases and normal sales exception requires, among other things, physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business.  Contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value.  Substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by DTE Electric and DTE Gas meet the criteria specified for this exception.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market.  Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities.  These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable inputs.  The Registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques.  Credit risk of the Registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact of which was immaterial at

December 31, 2019

and


.  The Registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

The fair values the Registrants calculate for their derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information.  Actual cash returns realized on derivatives may be different from the results the Registrants estimate using models.  As fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices, the Registrants perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of forward contracts.  See the sensitivity analysis in Item 7A. of this report, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."  See also the "Fair Value" section herein.

See

Notes 13 and 14

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, "

Fair Value

" and "

Financial and Other Derivative Instruments

," respectively.

Goodwill

Certain of DTE Energy's reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from business combinations.  DTE Energy performs an impairment test for each of the reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired.


In performing Step 1 of the impairment test, DTE Energy compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill.  If the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit, Step 2 of the test would be performed.  Step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value, if lower, as of the test date.

For Step 1 of the test, DTE Energy estimates the reporting unit's fair value using standard valuation techniques, including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. For certain reporting units, the fair values were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries.  The income approach includes a terminal value that utilizes an assumed long-term growth rate approach, which incorporates management's assumptions regarding sustainable long-term growth of the reporting units.  The income approach cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance.

One of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer’s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of the test date.

DTE Energy performs an annual impairment test each October.  In between annual tests, DTE Energy monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows, including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters, and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs.  While DTE Energy believes the assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ from projections.  To the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill, which would adversely impact DTE Energy's earnings.

DTE Energy performed its annual impairment test as of October 1,


and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment existed.

The results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows as of the October 1,


valuation date:

______________________________________

(a)

Percentage by which the fair value of equity of the reporting unit would need to decline to equal its carrying value, including goodwill.

(b)

Discounted cash flows (DCF) incorporated

2020-2024

projected cash flows plus a calculated terminal value. For each of the reporting units, DTE Energy capitalized the terminal year cash flows at the weighted average costs of capital (WACC) less an assumed long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Management applied equal weighting to the DCF and market multiples analysis, where applicable, to determine the fair value of the respective reporting units.

(c)

Due to lack of market comparable information for the Power & Industrial and Energy Trading reporting units, DTE Energy did not perform a market multiples analysis.

DTE Energy recognized additional goodwill of

$171 million

at the Gas Storage and Pipelines reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the Blue Union and LEAP acquisition. For further discussion, see

Note 4

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Acquisitions

."


Business Combinations

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.  The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill.  The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined based on significant estimates and assumptions, including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future market prices.  In some cases, DTE Energy engages independent third-party valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values.  Refer to

Note 4

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Acquisitions

."

Long-Lived Assets

The Registrants evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable.  Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the long-lived assets are deteriorating business climate, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life.  The review of long-lived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions.  An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of long-lived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities.  Impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows.  When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the long-lived asset over its fair value.  An impairment would require the Registrants to reduce both the long-lived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment, which would adversely impact their earnings.

Pension and Other Postretirement Costs

DTE Energy sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the Registrants.  The measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors, including numerous assumptions and accounting elections.  When determining the various assumptions that are required, DTE Energy considers historical information as well as future expectations.  The benefit costs are affected by, among other things, the actual rate of return on plan assets, the long-term expected return on plan assets, the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, benefit plan design changes, and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees.  Pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments, some of which are capitalized.

DTE Energy had pension costs of

$112 million

in


,

$148 million

in


, and

$172 million

in


.  Other postretirement benefit credits were

$1 million

in


,

$36 million

in


, and

$31 million

in


.  Pension costs and other postretirement benefit credits for


were calculated based upon several actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of

7.30%

for the pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.  In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumptions, DTE Energy evaluated asset class risk and return expectations, as well as inflation assumptions.  Projected returns are based on broad equity, bond, and other markets.  DTE Energy's


expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of

35%

in equity markets,

42%

in fixed income markets, including long duration bonds, and

23%

invested in other assets.  DTE Energy's


expected long-term rate of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of

35%

in equity markets,

37%

in fixed income markets, and

28%

invested in other assets.  Because of market volatility, DTE Energy periodically reviews the asset allocation and rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate.  DTE Energy is lowering its long-term rate of return assumption for the pension plans to

7.10%

and lowering the other postretirement plans to

7.20%

for


.  DTE Energy believes these rates are reasonable assumptions for the long-term rates of return on the plans' assets for


given their respective asset allocations and DTE's capital market expectations.  DTE Energy will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually.


DTE Energy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year.  Current accounting rules provide that the MRV of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years.  For the pension plans, DTE Energy uses a calculated value when determining the MRV of the pension plan assets and recognizes changes in fair value over a three-year period.  Accordingly, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized.  Favorable asset performance in


resulted in unrecognized net gains.  As of

December 31, 2019

, DTE Energy had

$186 million

of cumulative gains related to investment performance in prior years, that were not yet recognized in the calculation of the MRV of pension assets.  For the other postretirement benefit plans, DTE Energy uses fair value when determining the MRV of other postretirement benefit plan assets, therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of MRV for these plans.

The discount rate that DTE Energy utilizes for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency.  The yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to the plans.  The discount rate determined on this basis was

3.28%

for the pension and 3.29% for the other postretirement plans at

December 31, 2019

compared to

4.40%

for both the pension and other postretirement plans at

December 31, 2018

.

DTE Energy changed the mortality assumption as of December 31, 2019 to reflect the updated MP-2019 projection scale.  The mortality assumptions used at

December 31, 2019

are the RP-2014 mortality table projected back to 2006 using Scale MP-2014, projected forward to 2015 using Scale MP-2017 and projected beyond 2015 using Scale MP-2019 with generational projection.  The base mortality tables vary by type of plan, employee's union status and employment status, with additional adjustments to reflect the actual experience and credibility of each population.

DTE Energy estimates the


total pension costs will be approximately

$120 million

in


, compared to

$112 million

in


.  The increase in total pension costs is primarily due to lower discount rates, offset by favorable asset returns.  The


other postretirement benefit credit will be approximately

$40 million

compared to

$1 million

in


.

The health care trend rates for DTE Energy assume

6.75%

for pre-65 participants and

7.25%

for post-65 participants for


, trending down to

4.50%

for both pre-65 and post-65 participants in 2032.

Future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates, and various other factors related to plan design.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets by one percentage point would have increased the


pension costs by approximately

$45 million

.  Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the


pension costs by approximately

$22 million

.  Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the


other postretirement credit by approximately

$17 million

.  Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased the


other postretirement credit by approximately

$21 million

.  Lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the other postretirement credit for


by approximately

$4 million

.

The value of the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was

$6.8 billion

at

December 31, 2019

and

$6.0 billion

at

December 31, 2018

.  At

December 31, 2019

, DTE Energy's qualified pension plans were underfunded by

$677 million

and its other postretirement benefit plans were overfunded by

$68 million

.  In


, the funded status of the pension plans improved as plan sponsor contributions and favorable asset returns were partially offset by a decrease in discount rates.  The funded status of the other postretirement benefit plans improved as favorable asset returns and favorable healthcare experience were partially offset by a decrease in discount rates.


Pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets.  DTE Energy made contributions to its qualified pension plans of

$150 million

in


and

$175 million

in


.  At the discretion of management, consistent with the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and depending upon financial market conditions, DTE Energy anticipates making contributions to its qualified pension plans of up to

$185 million

in


and up to

$458 million

over the next five years.  DTE Energy did not make other postretirement benefit plan contributions in


or


.  DTE Energy does not anticipate making any contributions to its other postretirement plans in


or over the next five years.  The planned pension contributions will be made in cash and/or DTE Energy common stock.

Legal Reserves

The Registrants are involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  The Registrants regularly assess their liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate.  Legal reserves are based upon the Registrants' management’s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the Registrants.

Accounting for Tax Obligations

The Registrants are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities.  The Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion, and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  If the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded.  Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold.  The Registrants also have non-income tax obligations related to property, sales and use, and employment-related taxes, and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters.

Accounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained, and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken.  The Registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carry-forwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Registrants believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of

December 31, 2019

and


are appropriate.  The ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements, and such adjustments could be material.

FAIR VALUE

Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative assets or liabilities.  Contracts DTE Energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power, natural gas, oil, and certain coal forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts.  Items DTE Energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory, pipeline transportation contracts, renewable energy credits, and storage assets.  See

Notes 13 and 14

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, "

Fair Value

" and "

Financial and Other Derivative Instruments

," respectively.

The tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of non-derivative natural gas storage, transportation, certain power contracts, and renewable energy credits which are subject to accrual accounting.  Consequently, gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods, resulting in volatility in the Registrants' reported period-by-period earnings; however, the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery and/or settlement.


The Registrants manage their MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract.  Accordingly, the Registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or natural gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year).

The Registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  For further discussion of the fair value hierarchy, see

Note 13

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Price Risk

The Electric and Gas businesses have commodity price risk, primarily related to the purchases of coal, natural gas, uranium, and electricity.  However, the Registrants do not bear significant exposure to earnings risk, as such changes are included in the PSCR and GCR regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms.  In addition, changes in the price of natural gas can impact the valuation of lost and stolen gas, storage sales, and transportation services revenue at the Gas segment.  The Gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of long-term storage contracts.  The Registrants are exposed to short-term cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery.

DTE Energy's Gas Storage and Pipelines segment has exposure to natural gas price fluctuations which impact the pricing for natural gas storage, gathering, and transportation.  DTE Energy manages its exposure through the use of short, medium, and long-term storage, gathering, and transportation contracts.


DTE Energy's Power and Industrial Projects business segment is subject to electricity, natural gas, and coal product price risk.  DTE Energy manages its exposure to commodity price risk through the use of long-term contracts.

DTE Energy's Energy Trading business segment has exposure to electricity, natural gas, coal, crude oil, heating oil, and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations.  These risks are managed by the energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy, capacity, storage, options, and futures contracts, within pre-determined risk parameters.

Credit Risk

Bankruptcies

DTE Energy's Power and Industrial Projects segment holds ownership interests in, and operates,

five

generating plants that sell electric output from renewable sources under long-term power purchase agreements with PG&E.  PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 29, 2019.  As of

December 31, 2019

, PG&Es account is substantially current and outstanding accounts receivable from PG&E are not material.  Therefore, DTE Energy determined

no

reserve was necessary.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the book value of long-lived assets used in producing electric output for sale to PG&E was approximately

$101 million

.  The Power and Industrial Projects segment also has equity investments, including a note receivable, of approximately

$74 million

in entities that sell power to PG&E.  In January 2019, following the bankruptcy filing, DTE Energy performed an impairment analysis on its long-lived assets.  Based on its undiscounted cash flow projections, DTE Energy determined it did

no

t have an impairment loss as of December 31, 2018.  DTE Energy also determined there was

no

t an other-than-temporary decline in its equity investments.  DTE has not identified subsequent facts or circumstances that would cause a change to these conclusions through December 31, 2019.  DTE Energy’s assumptions and conclusions may change, and it could have impairment losses if any of the terms of the contracts are not honored by PG&E or the contracts are rejected through the bankruptcy process.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Registrants regularly review contingent matters relating to customers and their contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts.  The Registrants believe their accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss.

Trading Activities

DTE Energy is exposed to credit risk through trading activities.  Credit risk is the potential loss that may result if the trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations.  DTE Energy utilizes both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of trading counterparties.


The following table displays the credit quality of DTE Energy's trading counterparties as of

December 31, 2019

:

_______________________________________

(a)

This category includes counterparties with minimum credit ratings of Baa3 assigned by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) or BBB- assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Group, a division of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Standard & Poor’s).  The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented

16%

of the total gross credit exposure.

(b)

This category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment grade.  The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented

1%

of the total gross credit exposure.

(c)

This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s but are considered investment grade based on DTE Energy’s evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness.  The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented

15%

of the total gross credit exposure.

(d)

This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s and are considered non-investment grade based on DTE Energy’s evaluation of the counterparty’s creditworthiness.  The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented

1%

of the total gross credit exposure.

Other

The Registrants engage in business with customers that are non-investment grade.  The Registrants closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and, when deemed necessary and permitted under the tariffs, request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations.

Interest Rate Risk

DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt.  In order to manage interest costs, DTE Energy may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements.  DTE Energy's exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial paper rates, and LIBOR.  As of

December 31, 2019

, DTE Energy had a floating rate debt-to-total debt ratio of

4.8%

.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

DTE Energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts.  These contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power, as well as for long-term transportation capacity.  To limit DTE Energy's exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations, DTE Energy has entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through

December 2023

.

Summary of Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses were performed on the fair values of commodity contracts for DTE Energy and long-term debt obligations for the Registrants.  The commodity contracts listed below principally relate to energy marketing and trading activities.  The sensitivity analyses involved increasing and decreasing forward prices and rates at

December 31, 2019

and


by a hypothetical 10% and calculating the resulting change in the fair values.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The following Consolidated Financial Statements and financial statement schedules are included herein:


DTE Energy — Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

Management of DTE Energy carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of DTE Energy's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of DTE Energy's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of

December 31, 2019

, which is the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on this evaluation, DTE Energy's CEO and CFO have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by DTE Energy in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to DTE Energy's management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and procedures, management cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of its disclosure controls and procedures will be attained.

(b) Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

Management of DTE Energy is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, DTE Energy's CEO and CFO, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management has excluded the acquisition of M5 Louisiana Gathering, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“Blue Union and LEAP”) from the Company’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 as it was acquired by the Company in an acquisition on December 4, 2019.  Blue Union and LEAP represent approximately 3% of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2019 and less than 1% of total revenues and other income for the year ended December 31, 2019. We plan to fully integrate the acquired businesses into our internal control over financial reporting in 2020.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of DTE Energy has assessed the effectiveness of DTE Energy’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO) in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

.  Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of

December 31, 2019

, DTE Energy’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of DTE Energy’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who also audited DTE Energy’s financial statements, as stated in their report which appears herein.

(c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting

There have been no changes in DTE Energy's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended

December 31, 2019

that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, DTE Energy's internal control over financial reporting.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

DTE Energy Company

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of DTE Energy Company and its subsidiaries

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018,

and the related consolidated statements

of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019,

including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018

,

and the results of its

operations and its

cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated

financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated

financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated

financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated

financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As described in Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, management has excluded the acquisition of M5 Louisiana Gathering, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 because they were acquired by the Company in a business combination during 2019.  We have also excluded M5 Louisiana Gathering, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.  M5 Louisiana Gathering, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 3% and less than 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.


Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below

are matters

arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Acquisition of M5 Louisiana Gathering, LLC - Customer Relationship Intangible Assets

As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of M5 Louisiana Gathering, LLC for $2.74 billion in 2019, which resulted in $1.47 billion of customer relationship intangible assets being recorded. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired was estimated by applying the income approach based upon discounted projected future cash flows attributable to the existing contracts and agreements.  Key management estimates and inputs include revenue and expense projections and discount rates based on the risks associated with the entities.  The intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 40 years, which is based on the number of years the assets are expected to economically contribute to the business.  The expected economic benefit incorporates existing customer contracts with a weighted-average amortization life of 13 years and expected renewal rates, based on the estimated volume and production lives of gas resources in the region.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the acquisition of M5 Gathering - customer relationship intangible assets is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in determining the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, which includes significant estimates and inputs related to revenue and expense projections, discount rates, and expected renewal rates of existing customer contracts.  This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence obtained related to these estimates and inputs. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.


Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the intangible assets and controls over development of the significant estimates and inputs related to the valuation of the intangible assets, including revenue and expense projections, discount rates, and expected renewals rates of existing customer contracts.  These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the intangible assets; and (iii) testing management’s cash flow projections used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets, including testing customer renewal rate assumptions included in the projections. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of significant estimates and inputs, including the revenue and expense projections, expected renewal rates, and the discount rate for the intangible assets.  Evaluating the reasonableness of these assumptions included agreeing revenue projections, consisting of pricing and minimum volume commitments, to customer contracts, comparing projections to prior year actual results and obtaining support for the expected renewal rates which included analyzing industry data on the production lives of the reserves in the region.  We used professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and discount rates.

Accounting for the Effects of New, or Changes to Existing, Regulatory Matters

As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded $4.176 million of regulatory assets and $3.329 million of regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2019.  The Company is required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses.  Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulatory services and be charged to and collected from customers. Future regulatory changes could result in a discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Company’s regulated businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates.  Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current regulatory environment.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of new, or changes to existing, regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in assessing the potential outcome and resulting accounting implications of new, or changes to existing, regulatory matters.  This in turn led to significant audit judgment and effort in evaluating the appropriateness of management’s assessment and audit evidence obtained related to the assessment.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s assessment and implementation of new regulatory matters or changes to existing regulatory matters. These procedures also included, among others, assessing (i) the reasonableness of management’s assessment of impacts arising from correspondence with regulators and changes in laws and regulations and (ii) the appropriateness of disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Testing regulatory assets and liabilities, including those subject to pending rate orders, involved considering the provisions and formulas outlined in the rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, and the application of relevant regulatory precedents.

Valuation of Level 3 Derivative Instruments

As described in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the fair value of level 3 derivative assets was $160 million and the fair value of level 3 derivative liabilities was $156 million as of December 31, 2019.  Contracts classified as derivative instruments include electricity, natural gas, oil, certain environmental contracts, certain coal forwards, futures, options, swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts.  The fair value estimate of level 3 assets and liabilities consist of unobservable inputs, and the fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that are generally less readily observable and supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date.  Management primarily uses a discounted cash flow valuation technique to value level 3 assets and liabilities, which include forward basis prices as unobservable inputs.  Other inputs to the valuation model include commodity market prices, broker quotes, interest rates, credit ratings, default rates, market-based seasonality, and basis differential factors.


The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of level 3 derivative instruments is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management to determine the fair value of these instruments due to the use of internally-developed models or methodologies, which included significant assumptions related to forward basis prices, commodity market prices, broker quotes, and basis differential factors.  This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence obtained related to the valuation, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of level 3 derivative instruments, including controls over the models and methodologies, data, and significant assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, testing the underlying data used in the estimate, evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies, and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management in developing the fair value measurement related to forward basis prices, commodity market prices, broker quotes, and basis differential factors.  We used professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the internally developed models and methodologies, including assessing the methodology used to develop forward basis prices and assessing the key inputs and assumptions used in the models, including commodity market prices, broker quotes, and basis differential factors.

DTE Electric — Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

Management of DTE Electric carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of DTE Electric's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of DTE Electric's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of

December 31, 2019

, which is the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on this evaluation, DTE Electric's CEO and CFO have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by DTE Electric in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to DTE Electric's management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and procedures, management cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of its disclosure controls and procedures will be attained.

(b) Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

Management of DTE Electric is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, DTE Electric's CEO and CFO, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of DTE Electric has assessed the effectiveness of DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO) in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of

December 31, 2019

, DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

This annual report does not include an audit report of DTE Electric's independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.  Management’s report was not subject to audit by DTE Electric's independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit DTE Electric to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

(c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting

There have been no changes in DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended

December 31, 2019

that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of

DTE Electric Company

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of DTE Electric Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018,

and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholder’s equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019,

including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of

its

operations and its

cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits of these consolidated

financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In addition, the Registrants are regulated by other federal and state regulatory agencies including the NRC, the EPA, the EGLE, and for DTE Energy, the CFTC.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the Registrants are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These accounting principles require management to use estimates and assumptions that impact reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results may differ from the Registrants' estimates.

The information in these combined notes relates to each of the Registrants as noted in the Index of Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  However, DTE Electric does not make any representation as to information related solely to DTE Energy or the subsidiaries of DTE Energy other than itself.

Certain prior year balances for the Registrants were reclassified to match the current year's Consolidated Financial Statements presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

The Registrants consolidate all majority-owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in which they have controlling influence.  Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method when the Registrants are able to significantly influence the operating policies of the investee.  When the Registrants do not influence the operating policies of an investee, the cost method is used.  These Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the Registrants' proportionate interests in certain jointly-owned utility plants.  The Registrants eliminate all intercompany balances and transactions.

The Registrants evaluate whether an entity is a VIE whenever reconsideration events occur.  The Registrants consolidate VIEs for which they are the primary beneficiary.  If a Registrant is not the primary beneficiary and an ownership interest is held, the VIE is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  When assessing the determination of the primary beneficiary, a Registrant considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including: the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb the expected losses and/or the right to receive the expected returns of the VIE.  The Registrants perform ongoing reassessments of all VIEs to determine if the primary beneficiary status has changed.

Legal entities within DTE Energy's Power and Industrial Projects segment enter into long-term contractual arrangements with customers to supply energy-related products or services.  The entities are generally designed to pass-through the commodity risk associated with these contracts to the customers, with DTE Energy retaining operational and customer default risk.  These entities generally are VIEs and consolidated when DTE Energy is the primary beneficiary.  In addition, DTE Energy has interests in certain VIEs through which control of all significant activities is shared with partners, and therefore are generally accounted for under the equity method.

DTE Energy currently owns an


%

interest in SGG, which owns and operates midstream natural gas assets.  SGG has contracts through which certain construction risk is designed to pass-through to the customers, with DTE Energy retaining operational and customer default risk.  SGG is a VIE with DTE Energy as the primary beneficiary.

The Registrants have variable interests in NEXUS, which include DTE Energy's


%

ownership interest and DTE Electric's transportation services contract.  NEXUS is a joint venture which owns a 256-mile pipeline to transport Utica and Marcellus shale gas to Ohio, Michigan, and Ontario market centers.  NEXUS also owns Generation Pipeline, LLC, a 23-mile regulated pipeline system located in northern Ohio, which was acquired in September 2019.  Refer to Note 4, "Acquisitions," for additional information.  NEXUS is a VIE as it has insufficient equity at risk to finance its activities.  The Registrants are not the primary beneficiaries, as the power to direct significant activities is shared between the owners of the equity interests.  DTE Energy accounts for its ownership interest in NEXUS under the equity method.

The Registrants hold ownership interests in certain limited partnerships.  The limited partnerships include investment funds which support regional development and economic growth, as well as an operational business providing energy-related products.  These entities are generally VIEs as a result of certain characteristics of the limited partnership voting rights.  The ownership interests are accounted for under the equity method as the Registrants are not the primary beneficiaries.

DTE Energy has variable interests in VIEs through certain of its long-term purchase and sale contracts.  DTE Electric has variable interests in VIEs through certain of its long-term purchase contracts.  As of

December 31, 2019

, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that relate to its variable interests under long-term purchase and sale contracts are predominantly related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts owed by or to DTE Energy for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycle under the contracts.  As of

December 31, 2019

, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that relate to its variable interests under long-term purchase contracts are predominantly related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts owed by DTE Electric for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycle under the contracts.  The Registrants have not provided any significant form of financial support associated with these long-term contracts.  There is

no

material potential exposure to loss as a result of DTE Energy's variable interests through these long-term purchase and sale contracts.  In addition, there is

no

material potential exposure to loss as a result of DTE Electric's variable interests through these long-term purchase contracts.

The maximum risk exposure for consolidated VIEs is reflected on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and for DTE Energy, in

Note 19

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Commitments and Contingencies

," related to the REF guarantees and indemnities.  For non-consolidated VIEs, the maximum risk exposure of the Registrants is generally limited to their investment, notes receivable, future funding commitments, and amounts which DTE Energy has guaranteed.  See

Note 19

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Commitments and Contingencies

," for further discussion of the NEXUS guarantee arrangements.

The following table summarizes the major Consolidated Statements of Financial Position items for consolidated VIEs as of

December 31, 2019

and


.  All assets and liabilities of a consolidated VIE are presented where it has been determined that a consolidated VIE has either (1) assets that can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE or (2) liabilities for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.  VIEs, in which DTE Energy holds a majority voting interest and is the primary beneficiary, that meet the definition of a business and whose assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE's obligations have been excluded from the table below.

Amounts for DTE Energy's consolidated VIEs are as follows:

Equity Method Investments

Investments in non-consolidated affiliates that are not controlled by the Registrants, but over which they have significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.  Certain of the equity method investees are also considered VIEs and disclosed in the non-consolidated VIEs table above.  At

December 31, 2019

and


, DTE Energy's share of the underlying equity in the net assets of the investees exceeded the carrying amounts of Investments in equity method investees by

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively.  The difference is being amortized over the life of the underlying assets.

DTE Energy equity method investees are described below:

The balances in Other Equity Method Investees are individually insignificant and are primarily from the Power and Industrial Projects segment.  These investments are comprised of projects that deliver energy and utility-type products and services to an industrial customer, sell electricity from renewable energy projects under long-term power purchase agreements, and produce and sell metallurgical coke.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Other Income

Other income for the Registrants is recognized for non-operating income such as equity earnings of equity method investees, allowance for equity funds used during construction, contract services, and gains (losses) from trading securities.  DTE Energy's Power and Industrial Projects segment also recognizes Other income in connection with the sale of membership interests in reduced emissions fuel facilities to investors.  In exchange for the cash received, the investors will receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including income tax attributes.  The transactions are not treated as a sale of membership interests for financial reporting purposes.  Other income related to fixed non-refundable cash payments received from investors for which the earnings process is not contingent upon production of refined coal is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable contract term as the economic benefit from the ownership of the facility is transferred to investors.  Other income related to cash payments that is contingent upon production of refined coal is considered earned and recognized when the contingency regarding the timing and amount of payment is resolved, generally as refined coal is produced and tax credits are generated.

The following is a summary of DTE Energy's Other income:

Accounting for ISO Transactions

DTE Electric participates in the energy market through MISO.  MISO requires that DTE Electric submit hourly day-ahead, real-time, and FTR bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region.  DTE Electric accounts for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the day-ahead, real-time, and FTR markets.  In any single hour, transactions in each of the MISO energy markets are netted based on MWh to determine if DTE Electric is in a net sale or purchase position.  Net purchases are recorded in Fuel, purchased power, and gas

—

utility and net sales are recorded in Operating Revenues

—

Utility operations on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Energy Trading segment participates in the energy markets through various ISOs and RTOs.  These markets require that Energy Trading submits hourly day-ahead, real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across each region.  Energy Trading submits bids in the annual and monthly auction revenue rights and FTR auctions to the RTOs.  Energy Trading accounts for these transactions on a net hourly basis for the day-ahead, real-time, and FTR markets.  These transactions are related to trading contracts which, if derivatives, are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues

—

Non-utility operations, and if non-derivatives, the realized gains and losses for sales are recorded in Operating Revenues

—

Non-utility operations and purchases are recorded in Fuel, purchased power, and gas

—

non-utility in the DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations.

DTE Electric and Energy Trading record accruals for future net purchases adjustments based on historical experience and reconcile accruals to actual costs when invoices are received from MISO and other ISOs and RTOs.

Derivatives

Energy Trading classifies derivative transactions as revenue or expense based on the intent of the transaction (buy or sell).  Revenues are recorded on a gross or net basis within the income statement depending upon whether it represents a non-trading activity or trading activity, respectively.

For additional information, refer to

Note 14

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Financial and Other Derivative Instruments

Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is the change in common shareholders’ equity during a period from transactions and events from non-owner sources, including Net Income.  The amounts recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for DTE Energy include changes in benefit obligations, consisting of deferred actuarial losses and prior service costs, unrealized gains and losses from derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, DTE Energy's interest in other comprehensive income of equity investees which comprise the net unrealized gains and losses on investments, and foreign currency translation adjustments.  DTE Energy releases income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income when the circumstances upon which they are premised cease to exist.

Changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholder's Equity. For further discussion regarding changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "New Accounting Pronouncements."  For the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, reclassifications out of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) not relating to the adoption of new accounting pronouncements for DTE Energy were not material.

(a)

All amounts are net of tax, except for Foreign currency translation.

(b)

The amounts reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are included in the computation of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs (see

Note 21

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Retirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets

").

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks, and temporary investments purchased with remaining maturities of three months or less.  Restricted cash consists of funds held to satisfy requirements of certain debt and DTE Energy partnership operating agreements.  Restricted cash designated for interest and principal payments within one year is classified as a Current Asset.

Receivables

Accounts receivable are primarily composed of trade receivables and unbilled revenue.  The Registrants' Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value.

The allowance for doubtful accounts for DTE Electric and DTE Gas is generally calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies.  DTE Electric and DTE Gas establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses and management’s assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors.  Customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the due date, which is typically in


days, however, factors such as assistance programs may delay aggressive action.  DTE Electric and DTE Gas assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on past-due terms with customers.  Customer accounts are written off when collection efforts have been exhausted.  The time period for write-off is


days after service has been terminated.

The customer allowance for doubtful accounts for DTE Energy's other businesses is calculated based on specific review of probable future collections based on receivable balances generally in excess of


days.

DTE Energy unbilled revenues of

$

0.9

billion

and

$

1.0

billion

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, include

$


million

and

$


million

of DTE Electric unbilled revenues, respectively, included in Customer Accounts receivable.

Notes Receivable

Notes receivable, or financing receivables, for DTE Energy are primarily comprised of finance lease receivables and loans and are included in Notes receivable and Other current assets on DTE Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  Notes receivable, or financing receivables, for DTE Electric are primarily comprised of loans.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Notes receivable are typically considered delinquent when payment is not received for periods ranging from


to


days.  The Registrants cease accruing interest (nonaccrual status), consider a note receivable impaired, and establish an allowance for credit loss when it is probable that all principal and interest amounts due will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the note receivable.  Cash payments received on nonaccrual status notes receivable, that do not bring the account contractually current, are first applied to contractually owed past due interest, with any remainder applied to principal.  Accrual of interest is generally resumed when the note receivable becomes contractually current.

In determining the allowance for credit losses for notes receivable, the Registrants consider the historical payment experience and other factors that are expected to have a specific impact on the counterparty’s ability to pay.  In addition, the Registrants monitor the credit ratings of the counterparties from which they have notes receivable.

Inventories

Inventory related to utility operations is generally valued at average cost.  Inventory related to non-utility operations is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.

DTE Gas' natural gas inventory of

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.  The replacement cost of gas in inventory exceeded the LIFO cost by

$


million

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Property, Retirement and Maintenance, and Depreciation and Amortization

Property is stated at cost and includes construction-related labor, materials, overheads, and AFUDC for utility property.  The cost of utility properties retired is charged to accumulated depreciation.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.

Utility property at DTE Electric and DTE Gas is depreciated over its estimated useful life using straight-line rates approved by the MPSC.  DTE Energy's non-utility property is depreciated over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method.  Depreciation and amortization expense also includes the amortization of certain regulatory assets for the Registrants.

The cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized.  The amortization of nuclear fuel is included within Fuel, purchased power, and gas

—

utility in the DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations, and Fuel and purchased power in the DTE Electric Consolidated Statements of Operations, and is recorded using the units-of-production method.

See

Note 7

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Property, Plant, and Equipment

."

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset, an impairment loss is recognized resulting in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Intangible Assets

The Registrants have certain Intangible assets as shown below:

______________________________________

(a)

The useful lives of the customer relationship intangible assets are based on the number of years in which the assets are expected to economically contribute to the business.  The expected economic benefit incorporates existing customer contracts and expected renewal rates based on the estimated volume and production lives of gas resources in the region.

(b)

Emission allowances and renewable energy credits are charged to expense, using average cost, as the allowances and credits are consumed in the operation of the business.

The following table summarizes DTE Energy's estimated customer relationship and contract intangible amortization expense expected to be recognized during each year through


:

Excise and Sales Taxes

The Registrants record the billing of excise and sales taxes as a receivable with an offsetting payable to the applicable taxing authority, with

no

net impact on the Registrants’ Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Deferred Debt Costs

The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the life of each debt issue.  The deferred amounts are included as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of each debt issue in Mortgage bonds, notes, and other and Junior subordinated debentures on DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and in Mortgage bonds, notes, and other on DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  In accordance with MPSC regulations applicable to DTE Energy’s electric and gas utilities, the unamortized discount, premium, and expense related to utility debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized over the life of the replacement issue.  Discount, premium, and expense on early redemptions of debt associated with DTE Energy's non-utility operations are charged to earnings.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

The Registrants generally record investments in debt and equity securities at market value with unrealized gains or losses included in earnings.  Changes in the fair value of Fermi 2 nuclear decommissioning investments are recorded as adjustments to Regulatory assets or liabilities, due to a recovery mechanism from customers.  The Registrants' equity investments are reviewed for impairment each reporting period.  If the assessment indicates that an impairment exists, a loss is recognized resulting in the equity investment being written down to its estimated fair value.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Recently Adopted Pronouncements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842),

as amended.  This guidance requires a lessee to account for leases as finance or operating leases and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  Both types of leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet, with differing methodology for income statement recognition, depending on the lease classification.  The Registrants adopted the standard on January 1, 2019 using the prospective approach.  The standard provides a number of transition practical expedients of which the Registrants elected the package of three expedients that must be taken together, allowing entities to not reassess whether an agreement is a lease, to carryforward the existing lease classification, and to not reassess initial direct costs associated with existing leases; but did not elect to apply hindsight in determining lease term and impairment of the right-to-use assets.  The Registrants also elected to not evaluate land easements under the new guidance at adoption if they were not previously accounted for as leases.  These practical expedients apply to leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019.

At adoption of the new standard, the Registrants recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for certain operating leases of approximately

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, for DTE Energy and approximately

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, for DTE Electric as of January 1, 2019.  The right-of-use lease assets include

$


million

of prepaid lease costs that have been reclassified from Other assets, current and noncurrent, and

$


million

of deferred lease costs that have been reclassified from Other liabilities, current and noncurrent, for the Registrants.  The adoption of the ASU did not have a significant impact on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations but required additional disclosures for leases.  See

Note 18

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02,

Income Statement

—

Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

.  The amendments in this update allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJA.  The amendments in this update also require entities to disclose their accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.  The Registrants adopted the standard effective January 1, 2019.  Upon adoption, DTE Energy reclassified

$


million

of income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Retained Earnings.

Recently Issued Pronouncements

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,

Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,

as amended.  The amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current generally accepted accounting principles with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information, including forecasts, to develop credit loss estimates.  The ASU requires entities to use the new methodology to measure impairment of financial instruments, including accounts receivable, and may result in earlier recognition of credit losses than under current generally accepted accounting principles.

ACQUISITIONS

Electric Segment Acquisition

Effective September 12, 2019, DTE Sustainable Generation closed on the purchase of an


MW renewable energy project located in Michigan from Heritage Sustainable Energy in support of DTE Energy's renewable energy goals.  Direct transaction costs primarily related to advisory fees were immaterial and are included in Operation and maintenance in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The fair value of consideration provided for the acquisition was approximately

$


million

, of which

$


million

has been paid in cash.

The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.  Accordingly, the cost was allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective fair values as shown below:

The intangible assets recorded pertain to existing customer contracts and were estimated by applying the income approach, based on discounted projected cash flows attributable to the existing agreements.  The contract intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis with useful lives ranging from


years

to


years

, which is based on the remaining number of years the assets are expected to economically contribute to the business.  The pro forma financial information has not been presented for DTE Energy because the effects of the acquisition were not material to the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In conjunction with the above acquisition, DTE Sustainable Generation closed on a purchase and sale agreement with Heritage Sustainable Energy in January 2020 to acquire an additional renewable energy project for approximately

$


million

paid in cash.

The acquired projects are non-utility operations and related revenues are classified accordingly as Operating Revenues - Non-utility operations within DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Electric segment results of operations.  Refer to

Note 23

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Gas Storage and Pipelines Segment Acquisitions

Generation Pipeline Acquisition

Effective September 20, 2019, NEXUS closed on the purchase of Generation Pipeline, LLC, a pipeline system regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.  The 23-mile pipeline system supplies gas to industrial customers in the Toledo, OH area, has existing interconnects with ANR Pipeline Company and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company, and is located four miles from NEXUS.  Total consideration paid for the acquired entity was approximately

$


million

, of which DTE Energy's portion was


%

.  DTE Energy accounts for its ownership interest in NEXUS under the equity method, which now includes equity in earnings related to Generation Pipeline, LLC.

Blue Union and LEAP Acquisition

On December 4, 2019, DTE Energy closed on the purchase of midstream natural gas assets in support of its strategy to continue to grow and earn competitive returns for shareholders.  DTE Energy purchased


percent

of M5 Louisiana Gathering, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries from Momentum Midstream and Indigo Natural Resources.  The acquisition includes the Blue Union and LEAP assets which provide natural gas gathering and other midstream services to producers located primarily in Louisiana.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The fair value of the consideration provided for the entities acquired was

$

2.74

billion

and includes

$

2.36

billion

paid in cash and an estimated

$


million

of contingent consideration to be paid upon completion of a gathering pipeline in the second half of 2020.  The contingent payment will range from

$


million

to

$


million

, with no payment due until the pipeline is completed.  As of December 31, 2019, the liability for the contingent consideration payment and the related accretion expense of

$


million

is included in a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  The acquisition was financed through the issuance of Equity Units, common stock, and Senior Notes.  See

Notes 12 and 15

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Common Stock and Earnings Per Share

" and "

Long-Term Debt

," respectively, for more information.  The acquired assets are part of DTE Energy's non-utility Gas Storage and Pipelines segment.

The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.  The allocation of the purchase price included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position is preliminary and may be revised up to one year from the date of acquisition due to adjustments in the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.  The purchase price is subject to (i) final working capital settlement adjustments, and (ii) resolution of any indemnification claims that might be deducted from the

$


million

of cash consideration paid and held in escrow.  As such, DTE Energy cannot estimate the potential amount of the additional revisions to the purchase price allocation in 2020.  The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired totaled approximately

$


million

and was classified as goodwill.  The factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill are based on various strategic benefits that are expected to be realized from the Blue Union and LEAP acquisition.  The acquisition will provide DTE Energy with a platform for midstream growth and access to further investment opportunities in the Haynesville basin.  The goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on estimated fair values of the Blue Union and LEAP assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition,

December 4, 2019

.

The components of the preliminary purchase price allocation are as follows:

The intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition pertain to existing customer relationships, which were valued at approximately

$

1.47

billion

as of the acquisition date.  The fair value of the intangible assets acquired was estimated by applying the income approach.  The income approach is based upon discounted projected future cash flows attributable to the existing contracts and agreements.  The fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs, including management estimates and assumptions, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement, pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance.  Key estimates and inputs include revenue and expense projections and discount rates based on the risks associated with the entities.  The intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of


years

, which is based on the number of years the assets are expected to economically contribute to the business.  The expected economic benefit incorporates existing customer contracts with a weighted-average amortization life of


years

and expected renewal rates, based on the estimated volume and production lives of gas resources in the region.  See

REVENUE

Significant Accounting Policy

Upon the adoption of Topic 606, revenue is measured based upon the consideration specified in a contract with a customer at the time when performance obligations are satisfied.  Under Topic 606, a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services to the customer.  The Registrants recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  The Registrants have determined control to be transferred when the product is delivered or the service is provided to the customer.  For the

years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, recognition of revenue for the Registrants subsequent to the adoption of Topic 606 is substantially similar in amount and approach to that prior to adoption.

Rates for DTE Electric and DTE Gas include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel and purchased power costs, cost of natural gas, and certain other costs.  Revenues are adjusted for differences between actual costs subject to reconciliation and the amounts billed in current rates.  Under or over recovered revenues related to these cost recovery mechanisms are included in Regulatory assets or liabilities on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments to the billing factors.

Nature of Goods and Services

The following is a description of principal activities, separated by reportable segments, from which DTE Energy generates revenue.  For more detailed information about reportable segments, see

Note 23

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “

Segment and Related Information

.”

The Registrants have contracts with customers which may contain more than one performance obligation.  When more than one performance obligation exists in a contract, the consideration under the contract is allocated to the performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price.  DTE Energy generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or the use of the adjusted market assessment approach.  The adjusted market assessment approach involves the evaluation of the market in which DTE Energy sells goods or services and estimating the price that a customer in that market would be willing to pay.

Under Topic 606, when a customer simultaneously receives and consumes the product or service provided, revenue is considered to be recognized over time.  Alternatively, if it is determined that the criteria for recognition of revenue over time is not met, the revenue is considered to be recognized at a point in time.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Electric

Electric consists principally of DTE Electric.  Electric revenues are primarily comprised of the supply and delivery of electricity, and related capacity.  Revenues are primarily associated with cancelable contracts, with the exception of certain long-term contracts with commercial and industrial customers.  Revenues, including estimated unbilled amounts, are generally recognized over time based upon volumes delivered or through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service.  The Registrants have determined that the above methods represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer.  Unbilled revenues are typically determined utilizing approved tariff rates and estimated meter volumes.  Estimated unbilled amounts recognized in revenue are subject to adjustment in the following reporting period as actual volumes by customer class are known.  Revenues are typically subject to tariff rates based upon customer class and type of service and are billed and received monthly.  Tariff rates are determined by the MPSC on a per unit or monthly basis.

Gas

Gas consists principally of DTE Gas.  Gas revenues are primarily comprised of the supply and delivery of natural gas, and other services including storage, transportation, and appliance maintenance.  Revenues are primarily associated with cancelable contracts with the exception of certain long-term contracts with commercial and industrial customers.  Revenues, including estimated unbilled amounts, are generally recognized over time based upon volumes delivered or through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service.  DTE Energy has determined that the above methods represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer.  Unbilled revenues are typically determined using both estimated meter volumes and estimated usage based upon the number of unbilled days and historical temperatures.  Estimated unbilled amounts recognized in revenue are subject to adjustment in the following reporting period as actual volumes by customer class and service type are known.  Revenues are typically subject to tariff rates or other rates subject to regulatory oversight and are billed and received monthly.  Tariff rates are determined by the MPSC on a per unit or monthly basis.

Gas Storage and Pipelines

Gas Storage and Pipelines revenues generally consist of services related to the gathering, transportation, and storage of natural gas.  Contracts are primarily long-term in nature.  Revenues, including estimated unbilled amounts, are generally recognized over time based upon services provided or through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service.  DTE Energy has determined that the above methods represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer.  Revenues are typically billed and received monthly.  Pricing for such revenues may consist of demand rates, commodity rates, transportation rates, and other associated fees.  Consideration may consist of both fixed and variable components.  Generally, uncertainties in the variable consideration components are resolved and revenues are known at the time of recognition.

Power and Industrial Projects

Power and Industrial Projects revenues include contracts accounted for as leases which are outside of the scope of Topic 606.  For performance obligations within the scope of Topic 606, the timing of revenue recognition is dependent upon when control over the associated product or service is transferred.

Revenues at Power and Industrial Projects, within the scope of Topic 606, generally consist of sales of refined coal, coal, blast furnace coke, coke oven gas, electricity, equipment maintenance services, and other energy related products and services.  Revenues, including estimated unbilled amounts, for the sale of blast furnace coke are generally recognized at a point in time when the product is delivered, which represents the transfer of control to the customer.  Other revenues are generally recognized over time based upon services provided or through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service.  DTE Energy has determined that the above methods represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer.  Market based pricing structures exist in such contracts including adjustments for consumer price or other indices.  Consideration may consist of both fixed and variable components.  Generally, uncertainties in the variable consideration components are resolved and revenues are known at the time of recognition.  Billing terms vary and are generally monthly with payment terms typically within


days following billing.

Energy Trading

Energy Trading revenues consist primarily of derivative contracts outside of the scope of Topic 606.  For performance obligations within the scope of Topic 606, the timing of revenue recognition is dependent upon when control over the associated product or service is transferred.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Revenues, including estimated unbilled amounts, within the scope of Topic 606 arising from the sale of natural gas, electricity, power capacity, and other energy related products are generally recognized over time based upon volumes delivered or through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service.  DTE Energy has determined that the above methods represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer.  Revenues are known at the time of recognition.  Payment for the aforementioned revenues is generally due from customers in the month following delivery.

Revenues associated with RECs are recognized at a point in time when control of the RECs are transferred to the customer which is deemed to be when the subject RECs are entered for transfer to the customer in the applicable regulatory tracking system.  Revenues associated with RECs under a wholesale full requirements power contract are deferred until control has been transferred.  The deferred revenues represent a contract liability for which payment has been received and the amounts have been estimated using the adjusted market assessment approach.  With the exception of RECs, generally all other performance obligations associated with wholesale full requirements power contracts are satisfied over time in conjunction with the delivery of power.  At the time power is delivered, DTE Energy may not have control over the RECs as the RECs are not self-generated and may not yet have been procured resulting in deferred revenues.

Deferred Revenue

The following is a summary of deferred revenue activity:

The deferred revenues at DTE Energy generally represent amounts paid by or receivable from customers for which the associated performance obligation has not yet been satisfied.

Deferred revenues include amounts associated with REC performance obligations under certain wholesale full requirements power contracts.  Deferred revenues associated with RECs are recognized as revenue when control of the RECs has transferred.

Other performance obligations associated with deferred revenues include providing products and services related to customer prepayments.  Deferred revenues associated with these products and services are recognized when control has transferred to the customer.

The following table represents deferred revenue amounts for DTE Energy that are expected to be recognized as revenue in future periods:

Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations

In accordance with optional exemptions available under Topic 606, the Registrants did not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (1) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, (2) with the exception of fixed consideration, contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Registrants have the right to invoice for goods provided and services performed, and (3) contracts for which variable consideration relates entirely to an unsatisfied performance obligation.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Such contracts consist of varying types of performance obligations across the segments, including the supply and delivery of energy related products and services.  Contracts with variable volumes and/or variable pricing, including those with pricing provisions tied to a consumer price or other index, have also been excluded as the related consideration under the contract is variable at inception of the contract.  Contract lengths vary from cancelable to multi-year.

The Registrants expect to recognize revenue for the following amounts related to fixed consideration associated with remaining performance obligations in each of the future periods noted:

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

DTE Electric has a legal retirement obligation for the decommissioning costs for its Fermi 1 and Fermi 2 nuclear plants, dismantlement of facilities located on leased property, and various other operations.  DTE Electric has conditional retirement obligations for asbestos and PCB removal at certain of its power plants and various distribution equipment.  DTE Gas has conditional retirement obligations for gas pipelines, certain service centers, compressor and gate stations.  The Registrants recognize such obligations as liabilities at fair market value when they are incurred, which generally is at the time the associated assets are placed in service.  Fair value is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the Registrants' credit-adjusted risk-free rate.  For its utility operations, the Registrants recognize in the Consolidated Statements of Operations removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment.  Any differences between costs recognized related to asset retirement and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a Regulatory asset or liability on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred, such as for assets with indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.  Natural gas storage system and certain other distribution assets for DTE Gas and substations, manholes, and certain other distribution assets for DTE Electric have an indeterminate life.  Therefore, no liability has been recorded for these assets.

Changes to asset retirement obligations for


,


, and


were as follows:

Approximately

$

2.1

billion

of the asset retirement obligations represent nuclear decommissioning liabilities that are funded through a surcharge to electric customers over the life of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant.  The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and requires minimum decommissioning funding based upon a formula.  The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi 2.  Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level radioactive waste.  DTE Electric believes the MPSC collections will be adequate to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning.  The decommissioning assets, anticipated earnings thereon, and future revenues from decommissioning collections will be used to decommission Fermi 2.  DTE Electric expects the liabilities to be reduced to

zero

at the conclusion of the decommissioning activities.  If amounts remain in the trust funds for Fermi 2 following the completion of the decommissioning activities, those amounts will be disbursed based on rulings by the MPSC and FERC.

A portion of the funds recovered through the Fermi 2 decommissioning surcharge and deposited in external trust accounts is designated for the removal of non-radioactive assets and returning the site to greenfield.  This removal and greenfielding is not considered a legal liability.  Therefore, it is not included in the asset retirement obligation, but is reflected as the Nuclear decommissioning liability.  The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by DTE Electric.  Contributions to the Fermi 1 trust are discretionary.  For additional discussion of Nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets, see

REGULATORY MATTERS

Regulation

DTE Electric and DTE Gas are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting, and operating-related matters.  DTE Electric is also regulated by the FERC with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities.  Regulation results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses.

The Registrants are unable to predict the outcome of the unresolved regulatory matters discussed herein.  Resolution of these matters is dependent upon future MPSC orders and appeals, which may materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Registrants.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

DTE Electric and DTE Gas are required to record Regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses.  Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and be charged to and collected from customers.  Future regulatory changes could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for Regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Registrants' businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any Regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates.  Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of Regulatory assets and liabilities and that all Regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current regulatory environment.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The following are balances and a brief description of the Registrants' Regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31:

As noted below, certain Regulatory assets for which costs have been incurred have been included (or are expected to be included, for costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate case) in DTE Electric's or DTE Gas' rate base, thereby providing a return on invested costs (except as noted).  Certain other regulatory assets are not included in rate base but accrue recoverable carrying charges until surcharges to collect the assets are billed.  Certain Regulatory assets do not result from cash expenditures and therefore do not represent investments included in rate base or have offsetting liabilities that reduce rate base.

ASSETS

•

Recoverable pension and other postretirement costs

— Accounting standards for pension and other postretirement benefit costs require, among other things, the recognition in Other comprehensive income of the actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs that arise during the period but that are not immediately recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs.  DTE Electric and DTE Gas record the impact of actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs as a Regulatory asset since the traditional rate setting process allows for the recovery of pension and other postretirement costs.  The asset will reverse as the deferred items are amortized and recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs.

(a)

•

Fermi 2 asset retirement obligation

— This obligation is for Fermi 2 decommissioning costs.  The asset captures the timing differences between expense recognition and current recovery in rates and will reverse over the remaining life of the related plant.

(a)

•

Recoverable undepreciated costs on retiring plants

— Deferral of estimated remaining balances associated with coal power plants expected to be retired by 2023.

•

Recoverable Michigan income taxes

— The State of Michigan enacted a corporate income tax resulting in the establishment of state deferred tax liabilities for DTE Energy's utilities.  Offsetting Regulatory assets were also recorded as the impacts of the deferred tax liabilities will be reflected in rates as the related taxable temporary differences reverse and flow through current income tax expense.

•

Deferred environmental costs

— The MPSC approved the deferral of investigation and remediation costs associated with DTE Gas' former MGP sites.  Amortization of deferred costs is over a

ten

-year period beginning in the year after costs were incurred, with recovery (net of any insurance proceeds) through base rate filings.

(a)

•

Recoverable income taxes related to AFUDC equity

— Accounting standards for income taxes require recognition of a deferred tax liability for the equity component of AFUDC.  A regulatory asset is required for the future increase in taxes payable related to the equity component of AFUDC that will be recovered from customers through future rates over the remaining life of the related plant.

•

Unamortized loss on reacquired debt

— The unamortized discount, premium, and expense related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are deferred, amortized, and recovered over the life of the replacement issue.

•

Customer360 deferred costs

— The MPSC approved the deferral and amortization of certain costs associated with implementing Customer360, an integrated software application that enables improved interface among customer service, billing, meter reading, credit and collections, device management, account management, and retail access.  Amortization of deferred costs over a


-year amortization period began after the billing system was put into operation during the second quarter of 2017.

•

Energy Waste Reduction incentive

— DTE Electric and DTE Gas operate MPSC approved energy waste reduction programs designed to reduce overall energy usage by their customers.  The utilities are eligible to earn an incentive by exceeding statutory savings targets.  The utilities have consistently exceeded the savings targets and recognize the incentive as a regulatory asset in the period earned.

(a)

•

Nuclear Performance Evaluation and Review Committee Tracker

— Deferral and amortization of certain costs associated with oversight and review of DTE Electric's nuclear power generation program, including safety and regulatory compliance, nuclear leadership, nuclear facilities, as well as operation and financial performance, pursuant to the MPSC authorization.  The approved

five

-year amortization period began January 1, 2018, with recovery through base rate filings.

•

Enhanced Tree Trimming Program deferred costs

— The MPSC approved the deferral of costs for the first

three years

of a tree trimming surge, aimed at reducing the number and duration of customer interruptions.  The MPSC will review the surge program and amortization of deferred costs in future rate filings.

•

Other recoverable income taxes

— Income taxes receivable from DTE Electric's customers representing the difference in property-related deferred income taxes and amounts previously reflected in DTE Electric's rates.  This asset will reverse over the remaining life of the related plant.

•

Non-service pension and other postretirement costs

— Upon adoption of ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018, certain non-service costs are no longer capitalized into Property, Plant & Equipment.  Such costs may be recorded to regulatory assets for ratemaking purposes and recovered as amortization expense based on the composite depreciation rate for plant-in-service.

•

Transitional Reconciliation Mechanism

— The MPSC approved the recovery of the deferred net incremental revenue requirement associated with the transition of PLD customers to DTE Electric's distribution system, effective July 1, 2014.  Annual reconciliations are filed and surcharges are implemented to recover approved amounts.

•

Accrued PSCR/GCR revenue

— Receivable for the temporary under-recovery of and carrying costs on fuel and purchased power costs incurred by DTE Electric which are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism and temporary under-recovery of and carrying costs on gas costs incurred by DTE Gas which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.

•

Removal costs asset

— Receivable for the recovery of asset removal expenditures in excess of amounts collected from customers.

(a)

Cost of removal is included within depreciation rates approved by the MPSC.  In connection with DTE Electric's recent rate order in 2019 which approved an updated depreciation study, DTE Electric re-measured the amount of historical depreciation expense that had been allocated between accumulated depreciation and cost of removal. The reallocation was performed following a settlement with the MPSC in which DTE Electric agreed to maintain specific, individual reserve accounts for the cost of removal for certain retiring plants. Based upon the reallocation, it was determined that the amounts collected for asset removal expenditures, as a component of depreciation, have exceeded actual asset removal expenditures.  Accordingly, DTE Electric reallocated amounts from accumulated depreciation to the removal cost regulatory balance resulting in a net Removal costs liability as of December 31, 2019.

________________________________________________

(a)

Regulatory assets not earning a return or accruing carrying charges.

LIABILITIES

•

Refundable federal income taxes

— DTE Electric and DTE Gas' remeasurement of deferred taxes due to the enactment of the TCJA, which reflects the net impact of the tax rate change on cumulative temporary differences expected to reverse after the effective date of January 1, 2018.  Refer to "2017 Tax Reform" section below for additional information.

•

Removal costs liability

— The amount collected from customers for the funding of future asset removal activities. For 2019, the liability includes amounts previously reflected within the Removal costs asset for DTE Electric, as noted above.

•

Negative other postretirement offset

— DTE Electric and DTE Gas' negative other postretirement costs are not included as a reduction to their authorized rates; therefore, DTE Electric and DTE Gas are accruing a Regulatory liability to eliminate the impact on earnings of the negative other postretirement expense accrual.  The Regulatory liabilities will reverse to the extent DTE Electric and DTE Gas' other postretirement expense is positive in future years.

•

Renewable energy —

Amounts collected in rates in excess of renewable energy expenditures.

•

Non-service pension and other postretirement costs

—

Upon adoption of ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018, certain non-service cost activity is no longer credited to Property, Plant & Equipment.  Such costs may be recorded to regulatory liabilities for ratemaking purposes and refunded through credits to amortization expense based on the composite depreciation rate for plant-in-service.

•

Accrued PSCR/GCR refund

- Liability for the temporary over-recovery of and a return on power supply costs and transmission costs incurred by DTE Electric which are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism and temporary over-recovery of and a return on gas costs incurred by DTE Gas which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.

•

TCJA rate reduction liability

— Due to the change in the corporate Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, DTE Electric and DTE Gas reduced rates charged to customers during 2018.  A regulatory liability equal to the difference between revenues billed based on a 35% rate, and revenues based on a 21% rate, was accrued for the period January 1, 2018 through the date the lower rates were implemented.  The refund of the liability occurred from January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019.

2018 Electric Rate Case Filing

DTE Electric filed a rate case with the MPSC on July 6, 2018 requesting an increase in base rates of

$


million

based on a projected twelve-month period ending April 30, 2020.  The requested increase in base rates was primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure investments, depreciation expense, as requested in the 2016 DTE Electric Depreciation Case Filing, and reliability improvement projects.  The rate filing also requested an increase in return on equity from

10.0

%

to

10.5

%

and included projected changes in sales, operation and maintenance expenses, and working capital.  In addition, the rate filing requested an Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism to recover the incremental revenue requirement associated with certain distribution, fossil generation, and nuclear generation capital expenditures through 2022.  Finally, as noted in the 2017 Tax Reform section below, DTE Electric proposed an amortization schedule for Calculation C in this filing. On February 1, 2019 DTE Electric reduced its initial requested increase in base rates to

$

248.6

million

, primarily reflecting the reduction in requested depreciation expense resulting from the MPSC's approval of new depreciation rates.  On May 2, 2019, the MPSC issued an order approving an annual revenue increase of

$


million

for services rendered on or after May 9, 2019.  The MPSC authorized a return on equity of

10.0

%

.  In addition, the order approved the proposed amortization schedule for Calculation C but denied the requested Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism.

2019 Electric Rate Case Filing

DTE Electric filed a rate case with the MPSC on July 8, 2019 requesting an increase in base rates of

$


million

based on a projected twelve-month period ending April 30, 2021.  The requested increase in base rates is primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure and generation investments.  The rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from

10.0

%

to

10.5

%

and includes projected changes in sales and operating and maintenance expenses.  A final MPSC order in this case is expected by May 2020.

2016 DTE Electric Depreciation Case Filing

DTE Electric filed a depreciation case with the MPSC on November 1, 2016 requesting an increase in depreciation rates for plant in service balances as of December 31, 2015.  The MPSC issued an order on December 6, 2018 authorizing DTE Electric to increase its composite depreciation rate from

3.06

%

to

3.72

%

.  The new rates are effective for service rendered on or after May 9, 2019, per the final order in DTE Electric's 2018 rate case issued on May 2, 2019.

2017 Tax Reform

On December 27, 2017, the MPSC issued an order to consider changes in the rates of all Michigan rate-regulated utilities to reflect the effects of the federal TCJA.

On January 19, 2018, DTE Electric and DTE Gas filed information with the MPSC regarding the potential change in revenue requirements due to the TCJA effective January 1, 2018 and outlined their recommended method to flow the current and deferred tax benefits of those impacts to ratepayers.

On February 22, 2018, the MPSC issued an order in this case requiring utilities, including DTE Electric and DTE Gas, to follow a 3-step approach of credits and calculations.  In 2018, MPSC orders for the first two steps, Credit A and Credit B, were issued for DTE Electric and DTE Gas.  The third step is to perform Calculation C to address all remaining issues relative to the new tax law, which is primarily the remeasurement of deferred taxes and how the amounts deferred as Regulatory liabilities will flow to ratepayers.  DTE Gas filed its Calculation C case on November 16, 2018 to reduce the annual revenue requirement by

$


million

related to the amortization of deferred tax remeasurement.  On August 20, 2019, the MPSC issued an order in this case approving a

$


million

reduction to DTE Gas' annual revenue requirement.  This reduction in revenue will be offset by a corresponding reduction in income tax expenses with the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  DTE Electric proposed an amortization schedule for Calculation C in its general rate case filed July 6, 2018, which was approved by the MPSC in the May 2, 2019 rate order.

2019 Gas Rate Case Filing

DTE Gas filed a rate case with the MPSC on November 25, 2019 requesting an increase in base rates of

$


million

based on a projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2021.  The requested increase in base rates is primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure investments and operating and maintenance expenses.  The rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from

10.0

%

to

10.5

%

and includes projected changes in sales and working capital.  A final MPSC order in this case is expected by September 2020.

INCOME TAXES

Income Tax Summary

DTE Energy files a consolidated federal income tax return.  DTE Electric is a part of the consolidated federal income tax return of DTE Energy.  DTE Energy and its subsidiaries file consolidated and/or separate company income tax returns in various states and localities, including a consolidated return in the State of Michigan.  DTE Electric is part of the Michigan consolidated income tax return of DTE Energy.  The federal, state and local income tax expense for DTE Electric is determined on an individual company basis with no allocation of tax expenses or benefits from other affiliates of DTE Energy.  DTE Electric had income tax receivables with DTE Energy of

$


million

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

The Registrants' total Income Tax Expense varied from the statutory federal income tax rate for the following reasons:


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Components of the Registrants' Income Tax Expense were as follows:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts in the Registrant's Consolidated Financial Statements.  Consistent with the original establishment of these deferred tax liabilities (assets), recognition of these non-cash transactions are not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Registrants' deferred tax assets (liabilities) were comprised of the following at December 31:


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Tax credit carry-forwards for DTE Energy include

$

1.01

billion

of general business credits that expire from


through


and

$


million

of alternative minimum tax credits that will be refundable over the next

three years

.  The alternative minimum tax credits are production tax credits earned prior to 2006 but not utilized.  The majority of these alternative minimum tax credits were generated from projects that had received a private letter ruling (PLR) from the IRS.  These PLRs provide assurance as to the appropriateness of using these credits to offset taxable income, however, these tax credits are subject to IRS audit and adjustment.  No valuation allowance is required for the tax credits carry-forward deferred tax asset.

DTE Energy has a federal net operating loss carry-forward of

$

1.3

billion

as of

December 31, 2019

.  The net operating loss carry-forwards generated in 2015 and 2016 will expire from


through


, and the net operating loss carry-forward generated in 2018 and subsequent years will be carried forward indefinitely.  No valuation allowance is required for the federal net operating loss deferred tax asset.

DTE Energy has state and local deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forwards of

$


million

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.  The state and local net operating loss carry-forwards expire from


through


.  DTE Energy has recorded valuation allowances at

December 31, 2019

and


of approximately

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, which are primarily related to these deferred tax assets.  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, DTE Energy considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.

Tax credit carry-forwards for DTE Electric include

$


million

of general business credits that expire from


through


.  No valuation allowance is required for the tax credits carry-forward deferred tax asset.

DTE Electric has

no

state and local deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forwards at

December 31, 2019

, while there was

$


million

of state and local deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forwards at

December 31, 2018

.  No valuation allowance is required for DTE Electric's state and local net operating loss carry-forwards.

The above tables exclude unamortized investment tax credits that are shown separately on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted reducing the corporate income tax rate from

35%

to

21%

, effective January 1, 2018.  As a result of the enactment, the deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured to reflect the impact of the TCJA on the cumulative temporary differences expected to reverse after the effective date.  The net impact of this remeasurement was a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of

$

2.56

billion

, of which

$

2.45

billion

was attributable to regulated utilities and offset to regulatory assets and liabilities.  This regulatory treatment is consistent with prior precedent set by the MPSC from previous tax law changes.  The remaining

$


million

was attributable to the non-utility entities and was recognized as a net reduction to income tax expense in 2017.

During the

year ended December 31, 2018

, DTE Energy and DTE Electric finalized their analysis and recorded true-up adjustments to the remeasurement of deferred taxes of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively.  The impact of the true-up adjustments was an increase in Income Tax Expense, of which

$


million

was attributable to the regulated utilities and increased Regulatory liabilities.

During 2019, DTE Electric and DTE Gas began amortizing excess deferred tax liabilities in accordance with orders issued by the Michigan Public Service Commission.  Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for further detail regarding these orders.

FAIR VALUE

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market.  Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities.  These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable inputs.  The Registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques.  Credit risk of the Registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact of which was immaterial at

December 31, 2019

and


.  The Registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

A fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  All assets and liabilities are required to be classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Assessing the significance of a particular input may require judgment considering factors specific to the asset or liability and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and its placement within the fair value hierarchy.  The Registrants classify fair value balances based on the fair value hierarchy defined as follows:

•

Level 1

— Consists of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to access as of the reporting date.

•

Level 2

— Consists of inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.

•

Level 3

— Consists of unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that are generally less readily observable and supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date.  Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best available information and subject to cost-benefit constraints.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.  The cash equivalents shown in the fair value table are comprised of short-term investments and money market funds.

Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts and Other Investments

The nuclear decommissioning trusts and other investments hold debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds.  Exchange-traded debt and equity securities held directly are valued using quoted market prices in actively traded markets.  Commingled funds that hold exchange-traded equity or debt securities are valued based on stated NAVs.  Non-exchange traded fixed income securities are valued based upon quotations available from brokers or pricing services.  Other assets such as private equity investments are classified as NAV assets.  A primary price source is identified by asset type, class, or issue for each security.  The trustee monitors prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the trustee determines that another price source is considered preferable.  The Registrants have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Derivative Assets and Liabilities

Derivative assets and liabilities are comprised of physical and financial derivative contracts, including futures, forwards, options, and swaps that are both exchange-traded and over-the-counter traded contracts.  Various inputs are used to value derivatives depending on the type of contract and availability of market data.  Exchange-traded derivative contracts are valued using quoted prices in active markets.  The Registrants consider the following criteria in determining whether a market is considered active: frequency in which pricing information is updated, variability in pricing between sources or over time, and the availability of public information.  Other derivative contracts are valued based upon a variety of inputs including commodity market prices, broker quotes, interest rates, credit ratings, default rates, market-based seasonality, and basis differential factors.  The Registrants monitor the prices that are supplied by brokers and pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of an index if prices become unavailable or another price source is determined to be more representative of fair value.  The Registrants have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived.  Additionally, the Registrants selectively corroborate the fair value of their transactions by comparison of market-based price sources.  Mathematical valuation models are used for derivatives for which external market data is not readily observable, such as contracts which extend beyond the actively traded reporting period.  The Registrants have established a Risk Management Committee whose responsibilities include directly or indirectly ensuring all valuation methods are applied in accordance with predefined policies.  The development and maintenance of the Registrants' forward price curves has been assigned to DTE Energy's Risk Management Department, which is separate and distinct from the trading functions within DTE Energy.

The following table presents the fair value reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for DTE Energy:

The following table presents the fair value reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for DTE Electric:


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Derivatives are transferred between levels primarily due to changes in the source data used to construct price curves as a result of changes in market liquidity.  Transfers in and transfers out are reflected as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period.

There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for the Registrants during the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, and there were no transfers from or into Level 3 for DTE Electric during the same periods.

The following tables present the unobservable inputs related to DTE Energy's Level 3 assets and liabilities:

The unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the electricity and natural gas commodity types consist of inputs that are less observable due in part to lack of available broker quotes, supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date or are based on internally developed models.  Certain basis prices (i.e., the difference in pricing between two locations) included in the valuation of natural gas and electricity contracts were deemed unobservable.

The inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above security types if they were adjusted.  A significant increase (decrease) in the basis price would result in a higher (lower) fair value for long positions, with offsetting impacts to short positions.

FINANCIAL AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Registrants recognize all derivatives at their fair value as Derivative assets or liabilities on their respective Consolidated Statements of Financial Position unless they qualify for certain scope exceptions, including the normal purchases and normal sales exception.  Further, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge); or as hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge).  For cash flow hedges, the derivative gain or loss is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs.  For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for the derivative and hedged item are recognized in earnings each period.  For derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period.

The Registrants' primary market risk exposure is associated with commodity prices, credit, and interest rates.  The Registrants have risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks.  The Registrants use derivative instruments to manage some of the exposure.  DTE Energy uses derivative instruments for trading purposes in its Energy Trading segment.  Contracts classified as derivative instruments include electricity, natural gas, oil, certain environmental contracts, forwards, futures, options, swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts.  Items not classified as derivatives include natural gas and environmental inventory, pipeline transportation contracts, some environmental contracts, and natural gas storage assets.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

DTE Electric

— DTE Electric generates, purchases, distributes, and sells electricity.  DTE Electric uses forward contracts to manage changes in the price of electricity and fuel.  Substantially all of these contracts meet the normal purchases and normal sales exception and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.  Other derivative contracts are MTM and recoverable through the PSCR mechanism when settled.  This results in the deferral of unrealized gains and losses as Regulatory assets or liabilities until realized.

DTE Gas

— DTE Gas purchases, stores, transports, distributes, and sells natural gas, buys and sells transportation capacity, and sells storage capacity.  DTE Gas has fixed-priced contracts for portions of its expected natural gas supply requirements through March 2022.  Substantially all of these contracts meet the normal purchases and normal sales exception and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.  DTE Gas may also sell forward transportation and storage capacity contracts.  Forward transportation and storage contracts are generally not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.

Gas Storage and Pipelines —

This segment is primarily engaged in services related to the gathering, transportation, and storage of natural gas.  Primarily fixed-priced contracts are used in the marketing and management of transportation and storage services.  Generally, these contracts are not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.

Power and Industrial Projects

— This segment manages and operates energy and pulverized coal projects, a coke battery, reduced emissions fuel projects, renewable gas recovery, and power generation assets.  Primarily fixed-price contracts are used in the marketing and management of the segment assets.  These contracts are generally not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.

Energy Trading — Commodity Price Risk —

Energy Trading markets and trades electricity, natural gas physical products, and energy financial instruments, and provides energy and asset management services utilizing energy commodity derivative instruments.  Forwards, futures, options, and swap agreements are used to manage exposure to the risk of market price and volume fluctuations in its operations.  These derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings unless hedge accounting criteria are met.

Energy Trading — Foreign Currency Exchange Risk —

Energy Trading has foreign currency exchange forward contracts to economically hedge fixed Canadian dollar commitments existing under natural gas and power purchase and sale contracts and natural gas transportation contracts.  Energy Trading enters into these contracts to mitigate price volatility with respect to fluctuations of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.  These derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings unless hedge accounting criteria are met.

Corporate and Other — Interest Rate Risk —

DTE Energy may use interest rate swaps, treasury locks, and other derivatives to hedge the risk associated with interest rate market volatility.

Credit Risk —

DTE Energy maintains credit policies that significantly minimize overall credit risk.  These policies include an evaluation of potential customers’ and counterparties’ financial condition, including the viability of underlying productive assets, credit rating, collateral requirements, or other credit enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees.  DTE Energy generally uses standardized agreements that allow the netting of positive and negative transactions associated with a single counterparty.  DTE Energy maintains a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of its customers, historical trends, and other information.  Based on DTE Energy's credit policies and its

December 31, 2019

provision for credit losses, DTE Energy’s exposure to counterparty nonperformance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on DTE Energy's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivative Activities

DTE Energy manages its MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract.  Accordingly, it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or natural gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year).  The following describes the categories of activities represented by their operating characteristics and key risks:

•

Asset Optimization

— Represents derivative activity associated with assets owned and contracted by DTE Energy, including forward natural gas purchases and sales, natural gas transportation, and storage capacity.  Changes in the value of derivatives in this category typically economically offset changes in the value of underlying non-derivative positions, which do not qualify for fair value accounting.  The difference in accounting treatment of derivatives in this category and the underlying non-derivative positions can result in significant earnings volatility.

•

Marketing and Origination

— Represents derivative activity transacted by originating substantially hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers, producers, end-users, utilities, retail aggregators, and alternative energy suppliers.

•

Fundamentals Based Trading

— Represents derivative activity transacted with the intent of taking a view, capturing market price changes, or putting capital at risk.  This activity is speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an existing exposure.

•

Other

— Includes derivative activity at DTE Electric related to FTRs.  Changes in the value of derivative contracts at DTE Electric are recorded as Derivative assets or liabilities, with an offset to Regulatory assets or liabilities as the settlement value of these contracts will be included in the PSCR mechanism when realized.

The following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments for DTE Energy:

The following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments for DTE Electric:


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Certain of DTE Energy's derivative positions are subject to netting arrangements which provide for offsetting of asset and liability positions as well as related cash collateral.  Such netting arrangements generally do not have restrictions.  Under such netting arrangements, DTE Energy offsets the fair value of derivative instruments with cash collateral received or paid for those contracts executed with the same counterparty, which reduces DTE Energy's Total Assets and Liabilities.  Cash collateral is allocated between the fair value of derivative instruments and customer accounts receivable and payable with the same counterparty on a pro-rata basis to the extent there is exposure.  Any cash collateral remaining, after the exposure is netted to zero, is reflected in Accounts receivable and Accounts payable as collateral paid or received, respectively.

DTE Energy also provides and receives collateral in the form of letters of credit which can be offset against net Derivative assets and liabilities as well as Accounts receivable and payable.  DTE Energy had issued letters of credit of

$


million

outstanding at

December 31, 2019

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2018

, which could be used to offset net Derivative liabilities.  Letters of credit received from third parties which could be used to offset net Derivative assets were

$


million

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.  Such balances of letters of credit are excluded from the tables below and are not netted with the recognized assets and liabilities in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

For contracts with certain clearing agents, the fair value of derivative instruments is netted against realized positions with the net balance reflected as either 1) a Derivative asset or liability or 2) an Account receivable or payable.  Other than certain clearing agents, Accounts receivable and Accounts payable that are subject to netting arrangements have not been offset against the fair value of Derivative assets and liabilities.

The following table presents net cash collateral offsetting arrangements for DTE Energy:

The effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows:

Revenues and energy costs related to trading contracts are presented on a net basis in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Commodity derivatives used for trading purposes, and financial non-trading commodity derivatives, are accounted for using the MTM method with unrealized and realized gains and losses recorded in Operating Revenues — Non-utility operations.  Non-trading physical commodity sale and purchase derivative contracts are generally accounted for using the MTM method with unrealized and realized gains and losses for sales recorded in Operating Revenues — Non-utility operations and purchases recorded in Fuel, purchased power, and gas — non-utility.

The following represents the cumulative gross volume of DTE Energy's derivative contracts outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

:

Various subsidiaries of DTE Energy have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by DTE Energy.  These contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that DTE Energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE Energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade.  Certain of these provisions (known as "hard triggers") state specific circumstances under which DTE Energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as "soft triggers") are not as specific.  For contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which DTE Energy may ultimately be required to post.  The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily natural gas, power, and coal) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions.  As of

December 31, 2019

, DTE Energy's contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was

$


million

.

As of

December 31, 2019

, DTE Energy had

$

of derivatives in net liability positions, for which hard triggers exist.  There is

no

collateral that has been posted against such liabilities, including cash and letters of credit.  Associated derivative net asset positions for which contractual offset exists were

Cross Default Provisions

Substantially all of the net utility properties of DTE Electric and DTE Gas are subject to the lien of mortgages.  Should DTE Electric or DTE Gas fail to timely pay their indebtedness under these mortgages, such failure may create cross defaults in the indebtedness of DTE Energy.

2016 Acquisition Senior Notes Remarketing

In October 2016, DTE Energy issued

$


million

of 2016 Equity Units, initially in the form of Corporate Units.  The Corporate Units were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DTV.  Each Corporate Unit consisted of a stock purchase contract and a

1/20

interest in a RSN issued by DTE Energy.  The stock purchase contract obligated the holders to purchase shares of DTE Energy's common stock at a future settlement date.  The purchase price under the stock purchase contracts was

$


per Corporate Unit and the number of shares purchased was determined by a formula based upon the average closing price of DTE Energy common stock near the settlement date.  The RSNs were pledged as collateral to secure the purchase of common stock under the related stock purchase contracts.

In August 2019, DTE Energy remarketed the

$


million

2016 Series C

1.5

%

RSNs due 2024 pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Equity Units.  As a result of the remarketing, the interest rate was reset to

2.529

%

, payable semi-annually at the new rate beginning October 1, 2019.  DTE Energy did not receive any proceeds from the remarketing.  All proceeds belonged to the investors holding the related 2016 Equity Units and were temporarily used to purchase a portfolio of treasury securities. The securities were released on behalf of investors on October 1, 2019 to satisfy the related stock purchase contracts and pay the purchase price to DTE Energy for the issuance of approximately

5.87

million

shares of common stock.

Gas Storage and Pipelines Segment Acquisition Financing

In December 2019, DTE Energy closed on the purchase of midstream natural gas assets.  The acquisition was financed through the issuance of Equity Units, Senior Notes, and common stock.  For information on the common stock issuance, refer to

Note 12

to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "

Common Stock and Earnings Per Share

."

In November 2019, DTE issued

$

1.3

billion

of 2019 Equity Units.  Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $


and was initially issued in the form of a Corporate Unit, comprised of (i) a forward purchase contract to buy DTE Energy common stock (stock purchase contract) and (ii) a

1/20

undivided beneficial ownership interest in

$1,000

principal amount of

DTE Energy’s 2019 Series F 2.25% RSNs due 2025

.  The RSN debt instruments and the stock purchase contract equity instruments are deemed to be separate instruments as the investor may trade the RSNs separately from the stock purchase contracts and may also settle the stock purchase contracts separately.  The Corporate Units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DTP.

The stock purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from DTE Energy on the settlement date, November 1, 2022, for a price of $


per stock purchase contract, the following number of shares of DTE Energy’s common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments:

•

if the AMV of DTE Energy’s common stock, which is the average volume-weighted average price of DTE Energy’s common stock for the trading days during the


consecutive scheduled trading day period ending on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stock purchase contract settlement date, is equal to or greater than

$

157.50

,

0.3175

shares of common stock;

•

if the AMV is less than

$

157.50

but greater than $

126.00

, a number of shares of common stock equal to

$50

divided by the AMV; and

•

if the AMV is less than or equal to

$

126.00

,

0.3968

shares of common stock.

The RSNs bear interest at a rate of

2.25

%

per year, payable quarterly, and mature on

November 1, 2025

.  The RSNs will be remarketed in 2022.  If this remarketing is successful, the interest rate on the RSNs will be reset, and thereafter interest will be payable semi-annually at the reset rate.  If there is no successful remarketing, the interest rate on the RSNs will not be reset, and the holders of the RSNs will have the right to put the RSNs to DTE Energy at a price equal to


%

of the principal amount, and the proceeds of the put right will be deemed to have been applied against the holders’ obligation under the stock purchase contracts.  DTE Energy may also redeem, in whole or in part, the RSNs in the event of a failed final remarketing.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

DTE Energy will also pay the stock purchase contract holders quarterly contract adjustment payments at a rate of


%

per year of the stated amount of

$


per Equity Unit, or

$


per year, commencing on

February 1, 2020

.  The present value of the future contract adjustment payments of

$


million

is recorded as a reduction of shareholders’ equity, offset by the stock purchase contract liability.  The stock purchase contract liability is included in Current Liabilities — Other and Other Liabilities — Other on DTE Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  Interest payments on the RSNs are recorded as interest expense and stock purchase contract payments are charged against the liability.  Accretion of the stock purchase contract liability is recorded as imputed interest expense.  The treasury stock method will be used to compute diluted EPS for the stock purchase contract.  Under the treasury stock method, the stock purchase contract will only have a dilutive effect when the settlement rate is based on the market value of DTE’s common stock that is greater than

$

157.50

(the threshold appreciation price).  If payments for the stock purchase contract are deferred, DTE Energy may not make any cash distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments.  Also, during the deferral period, DTE Energy may not make any payments on or redeem or repurchase any debt securities that are equal in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the RSNs.

Until settlement of the stock purchase contracts, the shares of stock underlying each contract are not outstanding.  Under the terms of the stock purchase contracts, assuming no anti-dilution or other adjustments, DTE Energy will issue between

8.3

million

and

10.3

million

shares of its common stock in November 2022.  A total of

SHORT-TERM CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS

DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas have unsecured revolving credit agreements that can be used for general corporate borrowings, but are intended to provide liquidity support for each of the companies’ commercial paper programs.  Borrowings under the revolvers are available at prevailing short-term interest rates.  Additionally, DTE Energy has other facilities to support letter of credit issuance.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The agreements require DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas to maintain a total funded debt to capitalization ratio of no more than

0.65

to 1.  In the agreements, "total funded debt" means all indebtedness of each respective company and their consolidated subsidiaries, including finance lease obligations, hedge agreements, and guarantees of third parties’ debt, but excluding contingent obligations, nonrecourse and junior subordinated debt, and certain equity-linked securities and, except for calculations at the end of the second quarter, certain DTE Gas short-term debt.  "Capitalization" means the sum of (a) total funded debt plus (b) "consolidated net worth," which is equal to consolidated total equity of each respective company and their consolidated subsidiaries (excluding pension effects under certain FASB statements), as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  At

December 31, 2019

, the total funded debt to total capitalization ratios for DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas were

0.58

to 1,

0.51

to 1, and

0.48

to 1, respectively, and were in compliance with this financial covenant.

The availability under the facilities in place at

LEASES

Disclosures related to the

year ended

December 31, 2019

are presented as required under Topic 842.  Prior period disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2018 are presented under Topic 840.  The Registrants have elected to use a practical expedient provided by Topic 842 whereby comparative disclosures for prior periods are allowed to be presented under Topic 840.  As a result, the disclosures presented under Topic 842 and Topic 840 will not be fully comparable in specific disclosure requirements.

Lessee

Topic 842

— Leases at DTE Energy are primarily comprised of various forms of equipment, computer hardware, coal railcars, production facilities, buildings, and certain easement leases with terms ranging from approximately


to


years.  Leases at DTE Electric are primarily comprised of various forms of equipment, computer hardware, coal railcars, and certain easement leases with terms ranging from approximately


to


years.

A lease is deemed to exist when the Registrants have the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment, as conveyed through a contract, for a certain period of time and consideration paid.  The right to control is deemed to occur when the Registrants have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the identified assets and the right to direct the use of such assets.

Lease liabilities are determined utilizing a discount rate to determine the present values of lease payments.  Topic 842 requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease when it is readily determinable.  When the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the incremental borrowing rate is used.  The Registrants have determined their respective incremental borrowing rates based upon the rate of interest that would have been paid on a collateralized basis over similar tenors to that of the leases.  The incremental borrowing rates for DTE Electric and DTE Gas have been determined utilizing respective secured borrowing rates for first mortgage bonds with like tenors of remaining lease terms.  Incremental borrowing rates for non-utility entities have been determined utilizing an implied secured borrowing rate based upon an unsecured rate for a similar tenor of remaining lease terms, which is then adjusted for the estimated impact of collateral.

Certain leases of the Registrants contain escalation clauses whereby the payments are adjusted for consumer price or labor indices.  DTE Energy has leases with non-index based escalation clauses for fixed dollar or percentage increases.  DTE Electric has leases with non-index based escalation clauses for fixed dollar increases.  DTE Energy also has leases with variable payments based upon usage of, or revenues associated with, the leased assets.  DTE Electric also has leases with variable payments based upon the usage of the leased assets.

Certain leases of easements and coal railcars contain provisions whereby the Registrants have the option to terminate the lease agreement by giving notice of such termination during the time frames specified in the respective lease.  The Registrants have considered such provisions in the determination of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the lease would be terminated.

The Registrants have certain leases which contain purchase options.  Based upon the nature of the leased property and terms of the purchase options, the Registrants have determined it is not reasonably certain that such purchase options will be utilized.  Thus, the impact of the purchase options has not been included in the determination of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the subject leases.

The Registrants have certain leases which contain renewal options.  Where the renewal options were deemed reasonably certain to occur, the impacts of such options were included in the determination of the right of use assets and lease liabilities.

The Registrants have agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.  Consideration in a lease is allocated between lease and non-lease components based upon the estimated relative standalone prices.  The Registrants have certain coal railcar leases for which non-lease and lease components are accounted for as a single lease component, as permitted under Topic 842.

Lessor

Topic 842

— DTE Energy leases a portion of its pipeline system to the Vector Pipeline through a finance lease contract that has been renewed through 2025, with additional renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised through 2040.  DTE Energy owns a


%

interest in the Vector Pipeline.  In addition, DTE Energy has an energy services agreement that expires in 2026, of which a portion is accounted for as a finance lease.

DTE Energy also leases various assets under operating leases for a pipeline, energy facilities and related equipment.  Such leases are comprised of both fixed payments and variable payments which are contingent on volumes, with terms ranging from

years.  Generally, the operating leases do not have renewal provisions or options to purchase the assets at the end of the lease.  The operating leases generally do not have termination for convenience provisions.  Termination may be allowed under specific circumstances stated in the lease contract, such as under an event of default.

Certain of the finance and operating leases have lease terms that extend to the end of the estimated economic life of the leased assets, thereby resulting in no residual value.  Any remaining residual values under the finance and operating leases are expected to be recovered through rates, renewals or new lease contracts.  Residual values have been determined using the estimated economic life of the leased assets.  The finance and operating leases do not contain residual value guarantees.

Certain of the operating leases have both lease and non-lease components.  The lease and non-lease components are allocated based upon estimated relative standalone selling prices.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

DTE Electric

Air

— DTE Electric is subject to the EPA ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of SO


and NO

X

.  The EPA and the State of Michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze, mercury, and other air pollution.  These rules have led to controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce SO


, NO

X

, mercury, and other emissions.  Additional rulemakings may occur over the next few years which could require additional controls for SO


, NO

X

, and other hazardous air pollutants.

The EPA proposed revised air quality standards for ground level ozone in November 2014 and specifically requested comments on the form and level of the ozone standards.  The standards were finalized in October 2015.  The State of Michigan recommended to the EPA in October 2016 which areas of the state are not attaining the new standard.  On April 30, 2018, the EPA finalized the State of Michigan's recommended marginal non-attainment designation for southeast Michigan.  The State is required to develop and implement a plan to address the southeast Michigan ozone non-attainment area by 2021.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact of the State's plan to address the ozone non-attainment area at this time.

In July 2009, the Registrants received a NOV/FOV from the EPA alleging, among other things, that

five

DTE Electric power plants violated New Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements, and operating permit requirements under the Clean Air Act.  In June 2010, the EPA issued a NOV/FOV making similar allegations related to a project and outage at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant.  In March 2013, DTE Energy received a supplemental NOV from the EPA relating to the July 2009 NOV/FOV.  The supplemental NOV alleged additional violations relating to the New Source Review provisions under the Clean Air Act, among other things.

In August 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice, at the request of the EPA, brought a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against DTE Energy and DTE Electric, related to the June 2010 NOV/FOV and the outage work performed at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant.  In August 2011, the U.S. District Court judge granted DTE Energy's motion for summary judgment in the civil case, dismissing the case and entering judgment in favor of DTE Energy and DTE Electric.  In October 2011, the EPA filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  In March 2013, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for review of the procedural component of the New Source Review notification requirements.  In September 2013, the EPA filed a motion seeking leave to amend their complaint regarding the June 2010 NOV/FOV adding additional claims related to outage work performed at the Trenton Channel and Belle River Power Plants as well as additional claims related to work performed at the Monroe Power Plant.  In March 2014, the U.S. District Court judge again granted DTE Energy's motion for summary judgment dismissing the civil case related to Monroe Unit 2.  In April 2014, the U.S. District Court judge granted motions filed by the EPA and the Sierra Club to amend their New Source Review complaint adding additional claims for Monroe Units 1, 2, and 3, Belle River Units 1 and 2, and Trenton Channel Unit 9.  In October 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal of the U.S. District Court judge's dismissal of the Monroe Unit 2 case.  The amended New Source Review claims were all stayed pending resolution of the appeal by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  On January 10, 2017, a divided panel of the Court reversed the decision of the U.S. District Court.  On May 8, 2017, DTE Energy and DTE Electric filed a motion to stay the mandate pending filing of a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court.  The Sixth Circuit granted the motion on May 16, 2017, staying the claims in the U.S. District Court until the U.S. Supreme Court disposes of the case.  DTE Electric and DTE Energy filed a petition for writ of certiorari on July 31, 2017.  On December 11, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.  As a result of the Supreme Court electing not to review the matter, the case was sent back to the U.S. District Court for further proceedings and on June 14, 2018 the case was stayed pending settlement negotiations.  The proceedings at the District Court remain stayed while the parties discuss potential resolution of the matter.

The Registrants believe that the plants and generating units identified by the EPA and the Sierra Club have complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations.  Depending upon the outcome of the litigation and further discussions with the EPA regarding the

two

NOVs/FOVs, DTE Electric could be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question, implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical, engage in supplemental environmental programs, and/or pay fines.  The Registrants do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material impact on their Consolidated Financial Statements.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The EPA has implemented regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act to address emissions of GHGs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy.  Among these actions, in 2015 the EPA finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing fossil-fuel fired EGUs.  The performance standards for existing EGUs, known as the EPA Clean Power Plan, were challenged by petitioners and stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court in February 2016 pending final review by the courts.  On October 10, 2017, the EPA, under a new administration, proposed to rescind the Clean Power Plan, and in August 2018, the EPA proposed revised emission guidelines for GHGs from existing EGUs.  On June 19, 2019, the EPA Administrator officially repealed the Clean Power Plan and finalized its replacement, named the ACE rule.  The ACE Rule requires the state of Michigan to submit a plan in 2022 that includes GHG standards for existing coal-fired power plant units in Michigan.  These final rules do not impact DTE Energy's revised commitment to reduce carbon emissions


%

by the early 2020s,


%

by 2030, and


%

by 2040, or its goal of net

zero

emissions by 2050 for DTE Electric, from the 2005 carbon emissions levels.

In addition to the GHG standards for existing EGUs, in December 2018, the EPA issued proposed revisions to the carbon dioxide performance standards for new, modified, or reconstructed fossil-fuel fired EGUs.  The carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on DTE Electric, since DTE Electric has no plans to build new coal-fired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the standards.

Pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on DTE Electric's operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers.  Impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the purchase of emission credits from market sources, higher costs of purchased power, and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical.  DTE Electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers, as authorized by the MPSC.

To comply with air pollution requirements, DTE Electric spent approximately

$

2.4

billion

through


.  DTE Electric does

no

t anticipate additional capital expenditures for air pollution requirements through


, subject to the results of future rulemakings.

Water

— In response to an EPA regulation, DTE Electric was required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities.  Based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies, DTE Electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intake structures.  A final rule became effective in October 2014.  The final rule requires studies to be completed and submitted as part of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit application process to determine the type of technology needed to reduce impacts to fish.  DTE Electric has initiated the process of completing the required studies.  Final compliance for the installation of any required technology will be determined by the state on a case by case, site specific basis.  DTE Electric is currently evaluating the compliance options and working with the State of Michigan on evaluating whether any controls are needed.  These evaluations/studies may require modifications to some existing intake structures.  It is not possible to quantify the impact of this rulemaking at this time.

Contaminated and Other Sites

— Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke, or oil.  The facilities, which produced gas, have been designated as MGP sites.  DTE Electric conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites, including

three

former MGP sites.  The investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each MGP site.  In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Electric is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including the area surrounding an ash landfill, electrical distribution substations, electric generating power plants, and underground and aboveground storage tank locations.  The findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is expected to be incurred over the next several years.  At

December 31, 2019

and


, DTE Electric had

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, accrued for remediation.  Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Electric’s financial position and cash flows.  DTE Electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site.

Coal Combustion Residuals and Effluent Limitations Guidelines

— A final EPA rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals, commonly known as coal ash, became effective in October 2015, and was revised in October 2016 and July 2018.  The rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a non-hazardous waste and relies on various self-implementation design and performance standards.  DTE Electric owns and operates

three

permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coal-fired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants subject to certain provisions in the CCR rule.  At certain facilities, the rule currently requires the installation of monitoring wells, compliance with groundwater standards, and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant. At other facilities, the rule requires ash laden waters be moved from earthen basins to steel and concrete tanks.  DTE Electric has estimated the impact of the current rule to be

$


million

.

On December 2, 2019 a proposed revision to the CCR Rule was published in the Federal Register to address the D.C. Circuit’s 2018 decision regarding CCR impoundments that are not lined with an engineered liner system.  The rule proposes that all CCR impoundments that do not meet the engineered liner requirements must close by specific dates, and it further confirms that all clay lined impoundments are viewed as unlined.  The EPA is also preparing a rulemaking, expected to be proposed early in 2020, that will provide mechanisms to determine if certain alternative liner systems may be as protective as the current liners specified in the CCR rule.  DTE Electric is currently evaluating options based on the range of outcomes of the current proposed rule and the anticipated proposed rule to determine any changes to DTE Electric's plans in the operation and closure of coal ash impoundments.

At the State level, legislation was signed by the Governor in December 2018 and provides for further regulation of the CCR program in Michigan.  Additionally, the bill provides the basis of a CCR program that EGLE will submit to the EPA for approval to fully regulate the CCR program in Michigan in lieu of a Federal permit program.

In November 2015, the EPA finalized the ELG Rule for the steam electric power generating industry which requires additional controls to be installed between 2018 and 2023.  Compliance schedules for individual facilities and individual waste streams are determined through issuance of new National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits by the State of Michigan.  The State of Michigan has issued a NPDES permit for the Belle River Power Plant establishing a compliance deadline of December 31, 2021.  No new permits that would require ELG compliance have been issued for other facilities, consequently no compliance timelines have been established.

On April 12, 2017, the EPA granted a petition for reconsideration of the 2015 ELG Rule.  The EPA also signed an administrative stay of the ELG Rule’s compliance deadlines for fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater, among others.  On June 6, 2017, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule (Postponement Rule) to postpone certain applicable deadlines within the 2015 ELG rule.  The Postponement Rule was published on September 18, 2017.  The Postponement Rule nullified the administrative stay but also extended the earliest compliance deadlines for only FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water until November 1, 2020 in order for the EPA to propose and finalize a new ruling.  On November 22, 2019, the EPA issued a proposed rule to revise the technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards applicable to flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water.  The ELG compliance requirements and final deadlines for bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater, and total ELG related compliance costs will not be known until the EPA completes its reconsideration of the ELG Rule expected by the end of 2020.

DTE Gas

Contaminated and Other Sites

— DTE Gas owns or previously owned,


former MGP sites.  Investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each site.  Cleanup of

eight

of the MGP sites is complete and the sites are closed.  DTE Gas has also completed partial closure of

four

additional sites.  Cleanup activities associated with the remaining sites will continue over the next several years.  The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites.  In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Gas is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including gate stations, gas pipeline releases, and underground storage tank locations.  As of

December 31, 2019

and


, DTE Gas had

$


million

accrued for remediation.  Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Gas' financial position and cash flows.  DTE Gas anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the MPSC, which allows for amortization of the MGP costs over a

ten

-year period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs were incurred, will prevent the associated investigation and remediation costs from having a material adverse impact on DTE Gas' results of operations.

Non-utility

DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants.

In March 2019, the EPA issued a finding of violation to EES Coke, the Michigan coke battery facility that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DTE Energy, alleging that the 2008 and 2014 permits issued by EGLE did not comply with the Clean Air Act.  EES Coke evaluated the EPA's alleged violations and believes that the permits approved by EGLE complied with the Clean Air Act.  Discussions with the EPA are ongoing.  At the present time, DTE Energy does not believe this will have a material financial impact.

Other

In 2010, the EPA finalized a new

one

-hour SO


ambient air quality standard that requires states to submit plans and associated timelines for non-attainment areas that demonstrate attainment with the new SO


standard in phases.  Phase 1 addresses non-attainment areas designated based on ambient monitoring data.  Phase 2 addresses non-attainment areas with large sources of SO


and modeled concentrations exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for SO


.  Phase 3 addresses smaller sources of SO


with modeled or monitored exceedances of the new SO


standard.

Michigan's Phase 1 non-attainment area includes DTE Energy facilities in southwest Detroit and areas of Wayne County.  Modeling runs by EGLE suggest that emission reductions may be required by significant sources of SO


emissions in these areas, including DTE Electric power plants and DTE Energy's Michigan coke battery facility.  As part of the state implementation plan (SIP) process, DTE Energy has worked with EGLE to develop air permits reflecting significant SO2 emission reductions that, in combination with other non-DTE Energy sources' emission reduction strategies, will help the state attain the standard and sustain its attainment.  Since several non-DTE Energy sources are also part of the proposed compliance plan, DTE Energy is unable to determine the full impact of the final required emissions reductions on DTE's facilities at this time.

Michigan's Phase 2 non-attainment area includes DTE Electric facilities in St. Clair County.  State implementation plan submittal and EPA approval describing the control strategy and timeline for demonstrating compliance with the new SO


standard is the next step in the process and is expected to be completed by first quarter 2020.  DTE Energy is currently working with EGLE to develop the required SIP.  DTE Energy is unable to determine the full impact of the SIP strategy.

Synthetic Fuel Guarantees

DTE Energy discontinued the operations of its synthetic fuel production facilities throughout the United States as of December 31, 2007.  DTE Energy provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in its synfuel facilities.  The guarantees cover potential commercial, environmental, oil price, and tax-related obligations that will survive until


days

after expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations.  DTE Energy estimates that its maximum potential liability under these guarantees at

December 31, 2019

was approximately

$


million

.  Payment under these guarantees are considered remote.

REF Guarantees

DTE Energy has provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in or lease of its REF facilities.  The guarantees cover potential commercial, environmental, and tax-related obligations that will survive until


days

after expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations.  DTE Energy estimates that its maximum potential liability under these guarantees at

December 31, 2019

was

$


million

.  Payments under these guarantees are considered remote.

NEXUS Guarantees

NEXUS is party to certain


-year capacity agreements for the transportation of natural gas with DTE Gas and Texas Eastern Transmission, LP, an unrelated third party.  In conjunction with these agreements, DTE Energy provided certain guarantees on behalf of NEXUS to DTE Gas and Texas Eastern Transmission, LP, with maximum potential payments totaling

$


million

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

, respectively; each representing


%

of all payment obligations due and payable by NEXUS.  Each guarantee terminates at the earlier of (i) such time as all of the guaranteed obligations have been fully performed, or (ii)

two months

following the end of the primary term of the capacity agreements.  In October 2018, NEXUS Pipeline was placed in service.  The amount of each guarantee decreases annually as payments are made by NEXUS to each of the aforementioned counterparties.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

NEXUS is also party to certain


-year capacity agreements for the transportation of natural gas with Vector, an equity method investee of DTE Energy.  Pursuant to the terms of those agreements, in October 2018, DTE Energy executed a guarantee agreement with Vector, with a maximum potential payment totaling

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

, representing


%

of the first-year payment obligations due and payable by NEXUS.  The guarantee terminates at the earlier of (i) such time as all of the guaranteed obligations have been fully performed or (ii)


years from the date DTE Energy entered into the guarantee.

Should NEXUS fail to perform under the terms of these agreements, DTE Energy is required to perform on its behalf.  Payments under these guarantees are considered remote.

Other Guarantees

In certain limited circumstances, the Registrants enter into contractual guarantees.  The Registrants may guarantee another entity’s obligation in the event it fails to perform and may provide guarantees in certain indemnification agreements.  Finally, the Registrants may provide indirect guarantees for the indebtedness of others.  DTE Energy’s guarantees are not individually material with maximum potential payments totaling

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

.  Payments under these guarantees are considered remote.

DTE Energy is periodically required to obtain performance surety bonds in support of obligations to various governmental entities and other companies in connection with its operations.  As of

December 31, 2019

, DTE Energy had

$


million

of performance bonds outstanding.  In the event that such bonds are called for nonperformance, DTE Energy would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond.  DTE Energy is released from the performance bonds as the contractual performance is completed and does not believe that a material amount of any currently outstanding performance bonds will be called.

Vector Line of Credit

In July 2019, DTE Energy, as lender, entered into a revolving term credit facility with Vector, as borrower, in the amount of

C$


million

.  The credit facility was executed in response to the passage of Canadian regulations requiring oil and gas pipelines to demonstrate their financial ability to respond to a catastrophic event and exists for the sole purpose of satisfying these regulations.  Vector may only draw upon the facility if the funds are required to respond to a catastrophic event.  The maximum potential payments under the line of credit at

December 31, 2019

is

$


million

.  The funding of a loan under the terms of the credit facility is considered remote.

Labor Contracts

There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy subsidiaries' approximate

Purchase Commitments

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Registrants were party to numerous long-term purchase commitments relating to a variety of goods and services required for their businesses.  These agreements primarily consist of fuel supply commitments and renewable energy contracts for the Registrants, as well as energy trading contracts for DTE Energy.

The Registrants estimate the following commitments from


through


for DTE Energy, and


through


for DTE Electric, as detailed in the following table:


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

for DTE Energy and DTE Electric, respectively.  The Registrants have made certain commitments in connection with the estimated


annual capital expenditures and contributions to equity method investees.

Bankruptcies

DTE Energy's Power and Industrial Projects segment holds ownership interests in, and operates,

five

generating plants that sell electric output from renewable sources under long-term power purchase agreements with PG&E.  PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 29, 2019.  As of

December 31, 2019

, PG&Es account is substantially current and outstanding accounts receivable from PG&E are not material.  Therefore, DTE Energy determined

no

reserve was necessary.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the book value of long-lived assets used in producing electric output for sale to PG&E was approximately

$


million

.  The Power and Industrial Projects segment also has equity investments, including a note receivable, of approximately

$


million

in entities that sell power to PG&E.  In January 2019, following the bankruptcy filing, DTE Energy performed an impairment analysis on its long-lived assets.  Based on its undiscounted cash flow projections, DTE Energy determined it did

no

t have an impairment loss as of December 31, 2018.  DTE Energy also determined there was

no

t an other-than-temporary decline in its equity investments.  DTE has not identified subsequent facts or circumstances that would cause a change to these conclusions through December 31, 2019.  DTE Energy’s assumptions and conclusions may change, and it could have impairment losses if any of the terms of the contracts are not honored by PG&E or the contracts are rejected through the bankruptcy process.

Other Contingencies

The Registrants are involved in certain other legal, regulatory, administrative, and environmental proceedings before various courts, arbitration panels, and governmental agencies concerning claims arising in the ordinary course of business.  These proceedings include certain contract disputes, additional environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and pending judicial matters.  The Registrants cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings.  The Registrants regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that they can estimate and are considered probable of loss.  The resolution of these pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods they are resolved.

NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

Property Insurance

DTE Electric maintains property insurance policies specifically for the Fermi 2 plant.  These policies cover such items as replacement power and property damage.  NEIL is the primary supplier of the insurance policies.

DTE Electric maintains a policy for extra expenses, including replacement power costs necessitated by Fermi 2’s unavailability due to an insured event.  This policy has a 12-week waiting period and provides an aggregate

$


million

of coverage over a

three

-year period.

DTE Electric has

$

1.5

billion

in primary coverage and

$

1.25

billion

of excess coverage for stabilization, decontamination, debris removal, repair and/or replacement of property, and decommissioning.  The combined coverage limit for total property damage is

$

2.75

billion

.  The total limit for property damage for non-nuclear events is

$

2.0

billion

and an aggregate of

$


million

of coverage for extra expenses over a

two

-year period.

On January 13, 2015, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 was signed, extending TRIA through December 31, 2020.  For multiple terrorism losses caused by acts of terrorism not covered under the TRIA occurring within

one year

after the first loss from terrorism, the NEIL policies would make available to all insured entities up to

$

3.2

billion

, plus any amounts recovered from reinsurance, government indemnity, or other sources to cover losses.

Under NEIL policies, DTE Electric could be liable for maximum assessments of up to

$


million

per event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear plant should exceed the accumulated funds available to NEIL.


DTE Energy Company — DTE Electric Company

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Public Liability Insurance

As required by federal law, DTE Electric maintains

$


million

of public liability insurance for a nuclear incident.  For liabilities arising from a terrorist act outside the scope of TRIA, the policy is subject to one industry aggregate limit of

$


million

.  Further, under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005, deferred premium charges up to

$


million

could be levied against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than

$


million

per year per facility.  Thus, deferred premium charges could be levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the event of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, DTE Electric has a contract with the DOE for the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2 that required DTE Electric to pay the DOE a fee of


mill per kWh of Fermi 2 electricity generated and sold.  The fee was a component of nuclear fuel expense.  The


mill per kWh DOE fee was reduced to

zero

effective May 16, 2014.

The DOE's Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository program for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel was terminated in 2011.  DTE Electric is a party in the litigation against the DOE for both past and future costs associated with the DOE's failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the timetable set forth in the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.  In July 2012, DTE Electric executed a settlement agreement with the federal government for costs associated with the DOE's delay in acceptance of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2 for permanent storage.  The settlement agreement, including extensions, provides for a claims process and payment of delay-related costs experienced by DTE Electric through 2019.  DTE Electric's claims are being settled and paid on a timely basis.  The settlement proceeds reduce the cost of the dry cask storage facility assets and provide reimbursement for related operating expenses.

DTE Electric currently employs a spent nuclear fuel storage strategy utilizing a fuel pool and a dry cask storage facility.  The spent nuclear fuel storage strategy is expected to provide sufficient spent fuel storage capability for the life of the plant as defined by DTE Electric's operating license agreement.

The federal government continues to maintain its legal obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2 for permanent storage.  Issues relating to long-term waste disposal policy and to the disposition of funds contributed by DTE Electric ratepayers to the federal waste fund await future governmental action.

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

DTE Electric participates in various plans that provide pension and other postretirement benefits for DTE Energy and its affiliates.  The plans are sponsored by the LLC.  DTE Electric accounts for its participation in DTE Energy's qualified and nonqualified pension plans by applying multiemployer accounting.  DTE Electric accounts for its participation in other postretirement benefit plans by applying multiple-employer accounting.  Within multiemployer and multiple-employer plans, participants pool plan assets for investment purposes and to reduce the cost of plan administration.  The primary difference between plan types is assets contributed in multiemployer plans can be used to provide benefits for all participating employers, while assets contributed within a multiple-employer plan are restricted for use by the contributing employer.  As a result of multiemployer accounting treatment, capitalized costs associated with these plans are reflected in Property, plant, and equipment in DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  The same capitalized costs are reflected as Regulatory assets and liabilities in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  In addition, the service cost and non-service cost components are presented in Operation and maintenance in DTE Electric's Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The same non-service cost components are presented in Other (Income) and Deductions — Non-operating retirement benefits, net in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Plan participants of all plans are solely DTE Energy and affiliate participants.

Pension Plan Benefits

DTE Energy has qualified defined benefit retirement plans for eligible represented and non-represented employees.  The plans are noncontributory and provide traditional retirement benefits based on the employee's years of benefit service, average final compensation, and age at retirement.  In addition, certain represented and non-represented employees are covered under cash balance provisions that determine benefits on annual employer contributions and interest credits.  DTE Energy also maintains supplemental nonqualified, noncontributory, retirement benefit plans for certain management employees.  These plans provide for benefits that supplement those provided by DTE Energy’s other retirement plans.

Net pension cost for DTE Energy includes the following components:

Assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligation and net pension costs of DTE Energy are:

DTE Energy employs a formal process in determining the long-term rate of return for various asset classes.  Management reviews historic financial market risks and returns and long-term historic relationships between the asset classes of equities, fixed income, and other assets, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that asset classes with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-term.  Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates, asset class risks, and asset class returns are evaluated and considered before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.  The long-term portfolio return is also established employing a consistent formal process, with due consideration of diversification, active investment management, and rebalancing.  Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness.  As a result of this process, the Registrants have long-term rate of return assumptions for the pension plans of

7.10

%

and other postretirement benefit plans of

7.20

%

for


.  The Registrants believe these rates are a reasonable assumption for the long-term rate of return on plan assets for


given the current investment strategy.

The DTE Energy Company Affiliates Employee Benefit Plans Master Trust employs a liability driven investment program whereby the characteristics of plan liabilities are considered when determining investment policy.  Risk tolerance is established through consideration of future plan cash flows, plan funded status, and corporate financial considerations.  The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity, fixed income, and other investments.  Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks and large and small market capitalizations.  Fixed income investments generally include U.S. Treasuries, other governmental debt, diversified corporate bonds, bank loans, and mortgage-backed securities. Other investments are used to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.  Derivatives may be utilized in a risk controlled manner, to potentially increase the portfolio beyond the market value of invested assets and/or reduce portfolio investment risk.  Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

Key provisions of the stock incentive program are:

•

Authorized limit is

16,500,000

shares of common stock;

•

Prohibits the grant of a stock option with an exercise price that is less than the fair market value of DTE Energy’s stock on the date of the grant; and

•

500,000

shares of common stock; (2) stock awards for more than

150,000

shares of common stock; (3) performance share awards for more than

300,000

shares of common stock (based on the maximum payout under the award); or (4) more than

DTE Energy records compensation expense at fair value over the vesting period for all awards it grants.

The following table summarizes the components of stock-based compensation for DTE Energy:

Stock Options

Options are exercisable according to the terms of the individual stock option award agreements and expire

.  Participants have all rights of a shareholder with respect to a stock award, including the right to receive dividends and vote the shares.  Prior to vesting in stock awards, the participant: (i) may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, or otherwise dispose of shares; (ii) shall not retain custody of the share certificates; and (iii) will deliver to DTE Energy a stock power with respect to each stock award upon request.

Performance Share Awards

Performance shares awarded under the plan are for a specified number of shares of DTE Energy common stock that entitle the holder to receive a cash payment, shares of DTE Energy common stock, or a combination thereof.  The final value of the award is determined by the achievement of certain performance objectives and market conditions.  The awards vest at the end of a specified period, usually

three years

.  Awards granted in


,


, and


were primarily deemed to be equity awards.  The DTE Energy stock price and number of probable shares attributable to market conditions for such equity awards are fair valued only at the grant date.   DTE Energy accounts for performance share awards by accruing compensation expense over the vesting period based on: (i) the number of shares expected to be paid which is based on the probable achievement of performance objectives; and (ii) the closing stock price market value.  The settlement of the award is based on the closing price at the settlement date.

DTE Energy recorded compensation expense for performance share awards as follows:

_______________________________________

(a)

Sum of cash and stock settlements approximates the intrinsic value of the awards.

During the vesting period, the recipient of a performance share award has no shareholder rights.  During the period beginning on the date the performance shares are awarded and ending on the certification date of the performance objectives, the number of performance shares awarded will be increased, assuming full dividend reinvestment at the fair market value on the dividend payment date.  The cumulative number of performance shares will be adjusted to determine the final payment based on the performance objectives achieved.  Performance share awards are nontransferable and are subject to risk of forfeiture.
