ELECTRIC
    UTILITY

Description

Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison. Our
    generating plants are regulated by numerous federal and state
    governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC,
    the FERC, the NRC, the EPA and the MDEQ. Electricity is
    generated from our several fossil plants, a hydroelectric pumped
    storage plant and a nuclear plant, and is purchased from
    electricity generators, suppliers and wholesalers. The
    electricity we produce and purchase is sold to three major
    classes of customers: residential, commercial and industrial,
    principally throughout southeastern Michigan.

Represents power that is not distributed by Detroit Edison.

Weather, economic factors, competition and electricity prices
    affect sales levels to customers. Our peak load and highest
    total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of
    the year, driven by air conditioning and other cooling-related
    demands. Our operations are not dependent upon a limited number
    of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would
    not have a material adverse effect on Detroit Edison.

Fuel
    Supply and Purchased Power

Our power is generated from a variety of fuels and is
    supplemented with purchased power. We expect to have an adequate
    supply of fuel and purchased power to meet our obligation to
    serve customers. Our generating capability is heavily dependent
    upon the availability of coal. Coal is purchased from various
    sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary
    in both pricing and terms. We expect to obtain the majority of
    our coal requirements through long-term contracts, with the
    balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot
    purchases. We have nine long-term and nine short-term contracts
    for a total purchase of approximately 28 million tons of
    low-sulfur western coal to be delivered from 2010 through 2012.
    We also have nine long-term and two short-term contracts for the
    purchase of approximately 9 million tons of Appalachian
    coal to be delivered from 2010 through 2012. All of these
    contracts have fixed prices. We have approximately 87% of our
    2010 expected coal requirements under contract. Given the
    geographic diversity of supply, we believe we can meet our
    expected generation requirements. We lease a fleet of rail cars
    and have transportation contracts with companies to provide rail
    and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to our
    generating facilities.

Detroit Edison participates in the energy market through MISO.
    We offer our generation in the market on a day-ahead and
    real-time basis and bid for power in the market to serve our
    load. We are a net purchaser of power that supplements our
    generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles.

Properties

Detroit Edison owns generating plants and facilities that are
    located in the State of Michigan. Substantially all of our
    property is subject to the lien of a mortgage.

There are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange
    of electricity between Detroit Edison and electricity providers
    external to our service area. These interconnections are
    generally owned and operated by ITC Transmission and connect to
    neighboring energy companies.

Regulation

Detroit Edison’s business is subject to the regulatory
    jurisdiction of various agencies, including, but not limited to,
    the MPSC, the FERC and the NRC. The MPSC issues orders
    pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the
    costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions
    of service, accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit
    Edison’s MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have
    historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs,
    plus an authorized rate of return on our investments. The FERC
    regulates Detroit Edison with respect to financing authorization
    and wholesale electric activities. The NRC has regulatory
    jurisdiction over all phases of the operation, construction,
    licensing and decommissioning of Detroit Edison’s nuclear
    plant operations. We are subject to the requirements of other
    regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment and
    health.

See Notes 4, 9, 12 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Energy
    Assistance Programs

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and
    the State of Michigan, remain critical to Detroit Edison’s
    ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and
    collections expenses. Detroit Edison’s uncollectible
    accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of
    government-funded assistance its qualifying customers receive.
    We work continuously with the State of Michigan and others to
    determine whether the share of funding allocated to our
    customers is representative of the number of low-income
    individuals in our service territory.

Strategy
    and Competition

We strive to be the preferred supplier of electrical generation
    in southeast Michigan. We can accomplish this goal by working
    with our customers, communities and regulatory agencies to be a
    reliable, low-cost supplier of electricity. To ensure generation
    reliability, we continue to invest in our generating plants,
    which will improve both plant availability and operating
    efficiencies. We also are making capital investments in areas
    that have a positive impact on reliability and environmental
    compliance with the goal of high customer satisfaction.

Our distribution operations focus on improving reliability,
    restoration time and the quality of customer service. We seek to
    lower our operating costs by improving operating efficiencies.
    Revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions,
    economic factors, regulatory events and other risk factors as
    discussed in the “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of
    this Report. We expect to minimize the impacts of declines in
    average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which will
    partially decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes.

The electric Customer Choice program in Michigan allows all of
    our electric customers to purchase their electricity from
    alternative electric suppliers of generation services, subject
    to limits. Customers choosing to purchase power from alternative
    electric suppliers represented approximately 3% of retail sales
    in 2009 and 2008, and 4% of such sales in 2007. Customers
    participating in the electric Customer Choice program consist
    primarily of industrial and commercial customers whose
    MPSC-authorized full service rates exceed their cost of service.
    MPSC rate orders and recent energy legislation enacted by the
    State of Michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over
    five years and have placed a 10% cap on the total potential
    Customer Choice related migration, mitigating some of the
    unfavorable effects of electric Customer Choice on our financial
    performance. We expect that in 2010 customers choosing to
    purchase power from alternative electric suppliers will
    represent approximately 10% of retail sales. When market
    conditions are favorable, we sell power into the wholesale
    market, in order to lower costs to full-service customers.



Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is
    primarily from the

on-site

generation of industrial customers and from distributed
    generation applications by industrial and commercial customers.
    We do not expect significant competition for distribution to any
    group of customers in the near term.

    high-pressure transmission system to transport the gas to
    storage fields, processing plants, pipeline interconnections or
    other locations.

•

Storage and other —

Includes revenues from gas
    storage, appliance maintenance, facility development and other
    energy-related services.

Our gas sales, end user transportation and intermediate
    transportation volumes, revenues and net income are impacted by
    weather. Given the seasonal nature of our business, revenues and
    net income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of
    the calendar year. By the end of the first quarter, the heating
    season is largely over, and we typically realize substantially
    reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses
    in the third quarter.

Our operations are not dependent upon a limited number of
    customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not
    have a material adverse effect on our Gas Utility segment.

Natural
    Gas Supply

Our gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily send-out
    capacity of 2.6 Bcf, with approximately 67% of the volume
    coming from underground storage for 2009. Peak-use requirements
    are met through utilization of our storage facilities, pipeline
    transportation capacity, and purchased gas supplies. Because of
    our geographic diversity of supply and our pipeline
    transportation and storage capacity, we are able to reliably
    meet our supply requirements. We believe natural gas supply and
    pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market
    demands in the foreseeable future.



We purchase natural gas supplies in the open market by
    contracting with producers and marketers, and we maintain a
    diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts. Supplier,
    producing region, quantity, and available transportation
    diversify our natural gas supply base. We obtain our natural gas
    supply from various sources in different geographic areas (Gulf
    Coast, Mid-Continent, Canada and Michigan) under agreements that
    vary in both pricing and terms. Gas supply pricing is generally
    tied to NYMEX and published price indices to approximate current
    market prices.

We are directly connected to interstate pipelines, providing
    access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions
    in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and Canadian regions. Our
    primary long-term transportation supply contracts are as follows:

Properties

We own distribution, transmission and storage properties that
    are located in the State of Michigan. Our distribution system
    includes approximately 19,000 miles of distribution mains,
    approximately 1,177,000 service lines and approximately
    1,312,000 active meters. We own approximately 2,100 miles
    of transmission lines that deliver natural gas to the
    distribution districts and interconnect our storage fields with
    the sources of supply and the market areas.

We own properties relating to four underground natural gas
    storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of
    approximately 132 Bcf. These facilities are important in
    providing reliable and cost-effective service to our customers.
    In addition, we sell storage services to third parties. Most of
    our distribution and transmission property is located on
    property owned by others and used by us through easements,
    permits or licenses. Substantially all of our property is
    subject to the lien of a mortgage.

We own 666 miles of transportation and gathering
    (non-utility) pipelines in the northern lower peninsula of
    Michigan. We lease a portion of our pipeline system to the
    Vector Pipeline Partnership (an affiliate) through a
    capital-lease arrangement. See Note 19 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Regulation

MichCon’s business is subject to the regulatory
    jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to
    rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of
    regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting and
    operating-related matters. MichCon’s MPSC-approved rates
    charged to customers have historically been designed to allow
    for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on
    our investments. MichCon operates natural gas transportation and
    storage facilities in Michigan as intrastate facilities
    regulated by the MPSC and provides intrastate transportation and
    storage services pursuant to an MPSC-approved tariff. MichCon
    also provides interstate transportation and storage services in
    accordance with an Operating Statement on file with the FERC. We
    are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies
    with respect to safety, the environment and health.

See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.



Energy
    Assistance Program

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and
    the State of Michigan, remain critical to MichCon’s ability
    to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections
    expenses. MichCon’s uncollectible accounts receivable
    expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded
    assistance its qualifying customers receive. We work
    continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine
    whether the share of funding allocated to our customers is
    representative of the number of low-income individuals in our
    service territory.

Strategy
    and Competition

Our strategy is to be the preferred provider of natural gas in
    Michigan. As a result of more efficient furnaces and appliances,
    and customer conservation due to high natural gas prices and
    economic conditions, we expect future sales volumes to decline.
    We expect to minimize the impacts of declines in usage through
    regulatory mechanisms we have requested in our current rate
    case, which will partially decouple our revenue levels from
    sales volumes. We continue to provide energy-related services
    that capitalize on our expertise, capabilities and efficient
    systems. We continue to focus on lowering our operating costs by
    improving operating efficiencies.

Competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural
    gas providers, as well as providers of alternative fuels and
    energy sources. The primary focus of competition for end user
    transportation is cost and reliability. Some large commercial
    and industrial customers have the ability to switch to
    alternative fuel sources such as coal, electricity, oil and
    steam. If these customers were to choose an alternative fuel
    source, they would not have a need for our end-user
    transportation service. In addition, some of these customers
    could bypass our pipeline system and have their gas delivered
    directly from an interstate pipeline. We compete against
    alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and
    reliable service, supported by our storage capacity.

Our extensive transmission pipeline system has enabled us to
    market 400 to 500 Bcf annually for intermediate
    transportation services and storage services for Michigan gas
    producers, marketers, distribution companies and other pipeline
    companies. We operate in a central geographic location with
    connections to major Midwestern interstate pipelines that extend
    throughout the Midwest, eastern United States and eastern Canada.

MichCon’s storage capacity is used to store natural gas for
    delivery to MichCon’s customers as well as sold to third
    parties, under a variety of arrangements for periods up to three
    years. Prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are
    generally higher, but more volatile than for longer periods.
    Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and natural
    gas pricing.

GAS
    STORAGE AND PIPELINES

Description

Gas Storage and Pipelines owns partnership interests in two
    interstate transmission pipelines and two natural gas storage
    fields. The pipeline and storage assets are primarily supported
    by long-term, fixed-price revenue contracts. We have a
    partnership interest in Vector Pipeline (Vector), an interstate
    transmission pipeline, which connects Michigan to Chicago and
    Ontario. We also hold partnership interests in Millennium
    Pipeline Company which indirectly connects southern New York
    State to Upper Midwest/Canadian supply, while providing
    transportation service into the New York City markets. We have
    storage assets in Michigan capable of storing up to 90 Bcf
    in natural gas storage fields located in Southeast Michigan. The
    Washington 10 and 28 storage facilities are high deliverability
    storage fields having bi-directional interconnections with
    Vector Pipeline and MichCon providing our customers access to
    the Chicago, Michigan, other Midwest and Ontario markets.

Our customers include various utilities, pipelines, and
    producers and marketers.

    MichCon provides physical operations, maintenance, and technical
    support for the Washington 28 and Washington 10 storage
    facilities.

Regulation

The Gas Storage and Pipelines business operates natural gas
    storage facilities in Michigan as intrastate facilities
    regulated by the MPSC and provides intrastate storage and
    related services pursuant to an MPSC-approved tariff. We also
    provide interstate services in accordance with an Operating
    Statement on file with the FERC. Vector and Millennium Pipelines
    provide interstate transportation services in accordance with
    their FERC-approved tariffs.

Strategy
    and Competition

Our Gas Storage and Pipelines business expects to continue its
    steady growth plan by expanding existing assets and developing
    new assets that are typically supported with long-term customer
    commitments. The Gas Storage and Pipelines business focuses on
    asset development opportunities in the

Midwest-to-Northeast

region to supply natural gas to meet growing demand. We expect
    much of the growth in the demand for natural gas in the
    U.S. to occur within the Mid-Atlantic and New England
    regions. We forecast these regions will require incremental
    pipeline and gas storage infrastructure necessary to deliver gas
    volumes to meet growing demand. Vector is an interstate pipeline
    that is filling a large portion of that need, and is
    complemented by our Michigan storage facilities. In 2009, we
    completed the Shelby 2 storage field at our Washington 10
    storage complex which increased the capacity by 3 Bcf. Also
    in 2009, Vector Pipeline completed its Athens, Michigan
    Compressor Station expansion which increased its long-haul
    capacity by approximately

100 MMcf/d

to 1.3 Bcf/d. Due to the proximity of the Millennium
    Pipeline to the Marcellus Shale in Southern New York/Northern
    Pennsylvania, we anticipate that the Millennium Pipeline may
    have opportunities to expand in the future.

UNCONVENTIONAL
    GAS PRODUCTION

Description

Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural
    gas exploration, development and production primarily within the
    Barnett shale in north Texas.

In 2009, we added proved reserves of 67 Bcfe resulting in
    year-end total proved reserves of 234 Bcfe. The Barnett
    shale wells yielded 5 Bcfe of production in 2009. Barnett
    shale leasehold acres increased to 69,272 gross acres
    (63,367 net of interest of others) excluding impairments.
    Due to economic conditions and



low natural gas prices during the year, we chose to do minimal
    lease acquisitions and reduce the number of new wells. We
    drilled a total of 11 wells in the Barnett shale acreage in
    2009.

Our Barnett Shale gas production requires processing to extract
    natural gas liquids. Therefore, our wells are dedicated to
    various gathering and processing companies in the
    Fort Worth Basin. The revenues received for all products
    are based on prevailing market prices.

Strategy
    and Competition

We manage and operate our properties to maximize returns on
    investment and increase earnings. We continue to develop our
    holdings in the western portion of the Barnett shale and seek
    opportunities for acquisitions or divestitures of select
    properties within our asset base, when conditions are
    appropriate. Competitive pressures in the Barnett shale have
    decreased due to lower commodity prices resulting in reduced
    investment by industry participants. This downward pressure has
    created opportunities for us to reduce operating expenses and
    grow at lower cost than in prior periods.



From time to time, we use financial derivative contracts to
    manage a portion of our exposure to changes in the price of
    natural gas on our forecasted natural gas sales. The following
    is a summary of the financial contracts in place at
    December 31, 2009 related to Barnett shale production:

    approximately $25 million during 2010.

POWER AND
    INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS

Description

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects
    that deliver energy products and services to industrial,
    commercial and institutional customers; provide coal
    transportation and marketing; and sell electricity from
    biomass-fired energy projects. This business segment provides
    services using project assets usually located on or near the
    customers’ premises in the steel, automotive, pulp and
    paper, airport and other industries.

Products and services include pulverized coal and petroleum coke
    supply, metallurgical coke supply, power generation, steam
    production, chilled water production, wastewater treatment,
    compressed air supply and reduced emission fuel. We own and
    operate one gas-fired peaking electric generating plant, two
    biomass-fired electric generating plants and own one coal-fired
    power plant. Two additional biomass-fired electric generating
    plants are currently under development pending certain
    regulatory approvals with expected in-service dates of August
    2010 and March 2013. Production tax credits related to two of
    the coke battery facilities expired on December 31, 2009.

We also provide coal transportation services including fuel,
    transportation, storage, blending and rail equipment management
    services. Our external customers include electric utilities,
    merchant power producers, integrated steel mills and large
    industrial companies with significant energy requirements.
    Additionally, we participate in coal marketing and the purchase
    and sale of emissions credits. We own and operate a coal
    transloading terminal in South Chicago, Illinois.

We develop, own and operate landfill gas recovery systems
    throughout the United States. Landfill gas, a byproduct of solid
    waste decomposition, is composed of approximately equal portions
    of methane and carbon dioxide. We develop landfill gas recovery
    systems that capture the gas and provide local utilities,
    industry and consumers with an opportunity to use a competitive,
    renewable source of energy, in addition to providing
    environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
    This business segment performs coal mine methane extraction, in
    which we recover methane gas from mine voids for processing and
    delivery to natural gas pipelines.

We deliver reduced emission fuel to utilities with coal-fired
    electric generation power plants. We own and operate five
    facilities that process raw coal into reduced emission fuel
    resulting in significant reductions in Nitrogen Oxide (NO),
    Sulfur Dioxide
    (SO


),
    and Mercury (Hg) emissions. Production tax credits are expected
    to be generated by these facilities beginning in 2010 and
    continuing for ten years upon achieving certain criteria,
    including entering into transactions with unrelated equity
    partners or third-party customers for the reduced emission fuel.
    We expect to reduce our ownership interests in these facilities
    in 2010. We are investors in steel industry fuel entities which
    sell steel industry fuel to unrelated parties at three coke
    battery sites. Steel industry fuels facilities recycle tar
    decanter sludge, a byproduct of the coking process. Tax credits
    were generated in 2009 and we expect to generate additional
    credits in 2010. The ability to generate tax credits from the
    steel industry fuel process expires at the end of 2010.

Strategy
    and Competition

Power and Industrial Projects will continue leveraging its
    energy-related operating experience and project management
    capability to develop and grow our steel; renewable power;

on-site

energy; coal transportation, marketing, storage and blending;
    landfill gas recovery; and reduced emission fuel businesses. We
    also will continue to pursue opportunities to provide asset
    management and operations services to third parties. There are
    limited competitors for our existing disparate businesses who
    provide similar products and services.

We anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets
    where we operate. In determining the markets in which to
    compete, we examine closely the regulatory and competitive
    environment, the number of competitors and our ability to
    achieve sustainable margins. We plan to maximize the
    effectiveness of our inter-related businesses as we expand. As
    we pursue growth opportunities, our first priority will be to
    achieve value-added returns.

We intend to focus on the following areas for growth:

•

Acquiring and developing landfill gas recovery facilities,
    renewable energy projects, and other energy projects qualifying
    for tax credits; and

•

Providing operating services to owners of industrial and power
    plants.

After experiencing a weakened U.S. economy including
    constricted capital and credit markets, we expect a return to
    normal demand for our steel-related products in 2010 improving
    the financial performance of our coke battery and pulverized
    coal operations. In addition, our two primary automotive
    customers, General Motors and Chrysler, have emerged from
    bankruptcy and we continue providing onsite products and
    services. We will continue to monitor the steel and automotive
    industries closely during 2010.

Our Coal Transportation and Marketing business will continue to
    leverage its existing business in 2010. Trends such as carbon
    and greenhouse gas legislation, railroad and mining
    consolidation and the lack of certainty in developing new mines
    could have an impact on how we compete in the future. In 2011,
    our existing long-term rail transportation contract, which is at
    rates significantly below the current market, will expire and we
    anticipate a decrease in transportation-related revenue of
    approximately $120 million as a result. We will continue to
    work with suppliers and the railroads to promote secure and
    competitive access to coal to meet the energy requirements of
    our customers. We will seek to build our capacity to transport,
    store and blend greater amounts of coal and expect to continue
    to grow our business in a manner consistent with, and
    complementary to, the growth of our other business segments.

ENERGY
    TRADING

Description

Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas
    marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of
    returns from DTE Energy’s asset portfolio, optimization of
    contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and
    power transmission and generating capacity positions. Our
    customer base is predominantly utilities, local distribution
    companies, pipelines, and other marketing and trading companies.
    We enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our
    marketing and hedging activities. Most of the derivative
    financial instruments are accounted for under the

mark-to-market

method, which results in the recognition in earnings of
    unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of
    the derivatives. We utilize forwards, futures, swaps and option
    contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and
    trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within
    defined risk guidelines. Energy Trading also provides commodity
    risk management services to the other businesses within DTE
    Energy.

Significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and
    trading portfolio are economically hedged. The portfolio
    includes financial instruments and gas inventory, as well as
    contracted natural gas pipelines and storage and power
    transmission and generation capacity positions. Most financial
    instruments are deemed derivatives; however, gas inventory,
    power transmission, pipelines and certain storage assets are not
    derivatives. As a result, this segment may experience earnings
    volatility as derivatives are

marked-to-market

without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and
    assets. This results in gains and losses that are



recognized in different accounting periods. We may incur

mark-to-market

gains or losses in one period that could reverse in subsequent
    periods.

Regulation

Energy Trading has market-based rate authority from the FERC to
    sell power and authority from FERC to sell natural gas at market
    prices. Energy Trading is subject to FERC reporting requirements
    and market behavior rules. Energy Trading also complies with
    position limits and reporting requirements related to financial
    trading set by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Strategy
    and Competition

Our strategy for the energy trading business is to deliver
    value-added services to our customers. We seek to manage this
    business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the
    growth of our other business segments. We focus on physical
    marketing and the optimization of our portfolio of energy
    assets. We compete with electric and gas marketers, financial
    institutions, traders, utilities and other energy providers. The
    trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital
    and an investment grade credit rating. The Company believes it
    has ample available capital capacity to support Energy Trading
    activities. We monitor our use of capital closely to ensure that
    our commitments do not exceed capacity. A material credit
    restriction would negatively impact our financial performance.
    Competitors with greater access to capital or at a lower cost
    may have a competitive advantage. We have risk management and
    credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk.

Air —

Detroit Edison is subject to the EPA
    ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant
    emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Since 2005, EPA
    and the State of Michigan have issued additional emission
    reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate,
    regional haze and mercury air pollution. The new rules will lead
    to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
    nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. Further,
    additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years
    which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide,
    nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants. It is not possible
    to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this
    time.

Water —

In response to an EPA regulation,
    Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing
    the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures
    at several of its facilities. Based on the results of completed
    studies and expected future studies, Detroit Edison may be
    required to perform some mitigation activities, including the
    possible installation of additional control technologies to
    reduce the environmental impact of the intake structures.
    However, a January 2007 circuit court decision remanded back to
    the EPA several provisions of the federal regulation, resulting
    in a delay in complying with the regulation. In 2008, the
    U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the remanded
    cost-benefit analysis provision of the rule and in April 2009
    upheld EPA’s use of this provision in determining best
    available technology for reducing environmental impacts.
    Concurrently, the EPA continues to develop a revised rule, a
    draft of which is expected to be published by summer 2010. The
    EPA has also proposed an information collection request to begin
    a review of steam electric effluent guidelines. It is not
    possible at this time to quantify the impacts of these
    developing requirements.

Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) and Other Sites —

Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas
    pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured
    locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. The
    facilities, which produced gas for heating and other uses, have
    been designated as MGP sites. Gas Utility owns, or previously
    owned, fifteen such former MGP sites. Detroit Edison owns, or
    previously owned, three former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP
    sites, we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites
    where contamination is present as a result of historical and
    ongoing utility operations. These other sites include an
    engineered ash storage facility, electrical distribution
    substations, gas pipelines, and underground and aboveground
    storage tank locations. Cleanup activities associated with these
    sites will be conducted over the next several years.

Landfill

— Detroit Edison owns and operates a
    permitted engineered ash storage facility at the Monroe Power
    Plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant.
    Detroit Edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and
    identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and
    reconstruction.

The EPA has expressed its intentions to develop new federal
    regulations for coal ash under the authority of the Resources
    Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). A proposed regulation is
    expected in the first quarter of 2010. Among the options EPA is
    currently considering, is a ruling that may designate coal ash
    as a “Hazardous Waste” as defined by RCRA. However,
    agencies and legislatures have urged EPA to regulate coal ash as
    a non-hazardous waste. If EPA were to designate coal ash as a
    hazardous waste, the agency could apply some, or all, of the
    disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other
    existing hazardous wastes.



Some of the regulatory actions currently being contemplated
    could have a material adverse impact on our operations and
    financial position and the rates we charge our customers.

Global Climate Change —

Climate regulation

and/or

legislation is being proposed and discussed within the
    U.S. Congress and the EPA. On June 26, 2009, the
    U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean
    Energy and Security Act (ACESA). The ACESA includes a cap and
    trade program that would start in 2012 and provides for costs to
    emit greenhouse gases. Despite action by the Senate
    Environmental and Public Works Committee to pass a similar but
    more stringent bill in October 2009, full Senate action on a
    climate bill is not expected before the spring of 2010.
    Meanwhile, the EPA is beginning to implement regulatory actions
    under the Clean Air Act to address emission of greenhouse gases.
    Pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could
    have a material impact on our operations and financial position
    and the rates we charge our customers. Impacts include
    expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is
    currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital
    expenditures and the purchase of emission allowances from market
    sources. We would seek to recover these incremental costs
    through increased rates charged to our utility customers.
    Increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources
    could also increase the economic viability of energy produced
    from renewable

and/or

nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the
    development of market-based trading of carbon offsets providing
    business opportunities for our utility and non-utility segments.
    It is not possible to quantify these impacts on DTE Energy or
    its customers at this time.

Non-utility —

Our non-utility affiliates are
    subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations
    dealing with the protection of the environment from various
    pollutants. Our non-utility affiliates are substantially in
    compliance with all environmental requirements.

See Notes 12 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report and Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this Report.

EMPLOYEES

We had 10,244 employees as of December 31, 2009, of
    which 5,186 were represented by unions. The majority of our
    union employees are under contracts that expire in June and
    October 2010 and August 2012.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE
    Energy’s utility and non-utility businesses. To provide a
    framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy,
    we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant
    risks associated with our businesses. Although we have tried to
    identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in
    the future. Each of the following risks could affect our
    performance.

Regional and national economic conditions can have an
    unfavorable impact on us.

Our utility and
    non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the
    customers we serve. Our utilities and certain non-utility
    businesses provide services to the domestic automotive and steel
    industries which have undergone considerable financial distress,
    exacerbating the decline in regional economic conditions. Should
    national or regional economic conditions further decline,
    reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy
    services we supply, collections of accounts receivable and
    potentially higher levels of lost or stolen gas will result in
    decreased earnings and cash flow.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect
    us.

Regional and national economic
    condition

s

, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and
    regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic
    performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our
    credit rating. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the
    credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily
    reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating
    below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability
    to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our
    borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures and
    could impact future earnings and cash flows. In addition, a
    reduction in credit rating may



require us to post collateral related to various physical or
    financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related
    commodities, products and services, which could impact our
    liquidity.

Our ability to access capital markets is
    important.

Our ability to access capital markets
    is important to operate our businesses. In the past, turmoil in
    credit markets has constrained, and may again in the future
    constrain, our ability as well as the ability of our
    subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and
    refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates. In
    addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and
    the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets.
    We have substantial amounts of credit facilities that expire in
    2010. We intend to seek to renew the facilities on or before the
    expiration dates. However, we cannot predict the outcome of
    these efforts, which could result in a decrease in amounts
    available

and/or

an
    increase in our borrowing costs and negatively impact our
    financial performance.

Poor investment performance of pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting
    benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and
    results of operations.

Our costs of providing
    non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other
    postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of
    factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level
    of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding
    levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our
    required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The
    performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of
    assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations
    under our plans. We have significant benefit obligations and
    hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.
    These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield
    uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return
    rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and
    postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding
    requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans
    if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the
    foreseeable future. Additionally, our pension and postretirement
    benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest
    rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase,
    potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.
    Also, if future increases in pension and postretirement benefit
    costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable
    from Detroit Edison or MichCon customers, the results of
    operations and financial position of our company could be
    negatively affected. Without sustained growth in the plan
    investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets,
    we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts
    of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material
    impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of
    operations.

If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to
    record a charge to earnings.

We annually review
    the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made
    by the Company for impairment. Factors that may be considered
    for purposes of this analysis include any change in
    circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill
    may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and
    market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth
    rates in our industry. We cannot predict the timing, strength or
    duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery,
    worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate,
    however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the
    Company may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could
    potentially materially impact our results of operations and
    financial position.

Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to
    risk.

Events in the energy trading industry have
    increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business
    and the energy industry as a whole. In certain situations we may
    be required to post collateral to support trading operations,
    which could be substantial. If access to liquidity to support
    trading activities is curtailed, we could experience decreased
    earnings potential and cash flows. Energy trading activities
    take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to
    commodity price movements. We routinely have speculative trading
    positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines we set,
    resulting from the management of our business portfolio. To the
    extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating
    commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results
    and financial position. We manage our exposure by establishing
    and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.
    During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk
    management procedures may not work as planned and cannot
    eliminate all risks associated with these activities. As a
    result, we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and
    risk management decisions may have on our business, operating
    results or financial position.



We are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom we
    do business.

Adverse economic conditions
    affecting, or financial difficulties of, counterparties with
    whom we do business could impair the ability of these
    counterparties to pay for our services or fulfill their
    contractual obligations, or cause them to delay such payments or
    obligations. We depend on these counterparties to remit payments
    on a timely basis. Any delay or default in payment could
    adversely affect our cash flows, financial position, or results
    of operations.

We are subject to rate regulation.

Electric
    and gas rates for our utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC
    and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. We may
    be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by
    the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. Our ability to
    recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the
    incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in
    customers’ rates. Our regulators also may decide to
    disallow recovery of certain costs in customers’ rates if
    they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for
    recovery under our governing laws and regulations. The State of
    Michigan will elect a new governor and legislature in 2010 and
    we cannot predict the outcome of that election. We cannot
    predict whether election results or changes in political
    conditions will affect the regulations or interpretations
    affecting our utilities. New legislation, regulations or
    interpretations could change how our business operates, impact
    our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require
    us to incur additional expenses.

We may be required to refund amounts we collect under
    self-implemented rates.

Michigan law allows our
    utilities to self-implement rate changes six months after a rate
    filing, subject to certain limitations. However, if the final
    rate case order provides for lower rates than we have
    self-implemented, we must refund the difference, with interest.
    We have self-implemented rates in the past and have been ordered
    to make refunds to customers. Our financial performance may be
    negatively affected if the MPSC sets lower rates in future rate
    cases than those we have self-implemented, thereby requiring us
    to issue refunds. We cannot predict what rates an MPSC order
    will adopt in future rate cases.

Michigan’s electric Customer Choice program could
    negatively impact our financial performance.

The
    electric Customer Choice program, as originally contemplated in
    Michigan, anticipated an eventual transition to a totally
    deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be
    charged market-based rates for their electricity. The State of
    Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC
    continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while
    alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates. In
    addition, such regulated electric rates for certain groups of
    our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers. Due
    to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial
    implementation period of electric Customer Choice, many
    commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers. MPSC
    rate orders and recent energy legislation enacted by the State
    of Michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five
    years and have placed a cap on the total potential Customer
    Choice related migration. However, even with the electric
    Customer Choice-related relief received in recent Detroit Edison
    rate orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on
    participation in the electric Customer Choice program, there
    continues to be financial risk associated with the electric
    Customer Choice program. Electric Customer Choice migration is
    sensitive to market price and bundled electric service price
    increases.

Weather significantly affects
    operations.

Deviations from normal hot and cold
    weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow. Mild
    temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets,
    lowering income and cash flow. Ice storms, tornadoes, or high
    winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure
    and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material
    unplanned expenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts
    may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.

Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to
    risk.

Ownership of an operating nuclear
    generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks.
    These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental
    regulation and remediation, and operational factors that can
    significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a
    nuclear facility. While we maintain insurance for various
    nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such
    insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of
    an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating
    plant, which may affect our financial performance.

Construction and capital improvements to our power facilities
    subject us to risk.

We are managing ongoing and
    planning future significant construction and capital improvement
    projects at multiple power



generation and distribution facilities. Many factors that could
    cause delay or increased prices for these complex projects are
    beyond our control, including the cost of materials and labor,
    subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary
    permits, construction disputes and weather conditions. Failure
    to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any
    reason could adversely affect our financial performance and
    operations at the affected facilities.

The supply

and/or

price
    of energy commodities

and/or

related services may impact our financial
    results.

We are dependent on coal for much of our
    electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuations, fuel supply
    disruptions and increases in transportation costs could have a
    negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers
    for electricity and on the profitability of our non-utility
    business. Our access to natural gas supplies is critical to
    ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers. We
    have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in
    place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply
    prices, but there can be no assurances that our financial
    performance will not be negatively impacted by price
    fluctuations. The price of natural gas also impacts the market
    for our non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and
    alternative electric suppliers.

The supply

and/or

price
    other industrial raw and finished inputs

and/or

related services may impact our financial
    results.

We are dependent on supplies of certain
    commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and
    industrial materials and services in order to maintain

day-to-day

operations and maintenance of our facilities. Price fluctuations
    or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items
    could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our
    customers for our utility products and on the profitability of
    our non-utility businesses.

Unplanned power plant outages may be
    costly.

Unforeseen maintenance may be required to
    safely produce electricity or comply with environmental
    regulations. As a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be
    required to make spot market purchases of electricity that
    exceed our costs of generation. Our financial performance may be
    negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased
    costs.

Our estimates of gas reserves are subject to
    change.

While we cannot provide absolute
    assurance that our estimates of our Barnett gas reserves are
    accurate, great care is exercised in utilizing historical
    information and assumptions to develop reasonable estimates of
    future production and cash flow. We estimate proved gas reserves
    and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves.
    There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
    quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable to
    such reserves, including factors beyond our control. Reserve
    engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground
    accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner.
    The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of
    cash flows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the
    available data, assumptions regarding expenditures for future
    development and exploration activities, and of engineering and
    geological interpretation and judgment. Additionally, reserves
    and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or
    upward revisions, based upon production history, development and
    exploration activities and prices of gas. Actual future
    production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating
    expenses, quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of
    cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the
    assumptions and underlying information we used.

Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be
    limited.

To reduce U.S. dependence on
    imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax
    credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and
    electricity from alternative sources. We have generated
    production tax credits from synfuel, coke production, landfill
    gas recovery, biomass fired electric generation, reduced
    emission fuel, steel industry fuel and gas production
    operations. We have received favorable private letter rulings on
    all of the synfuel facilities. All production tax credits taken
    after 2006 are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service
    (IRS). If our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or
    in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could be additional
    tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that
    could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows. We have
    also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction
    with the sales of interests in the synfuel facilities.

We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.

DTE
    Energy is a holding company. Cash flows from our utility and
    non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses
    and dividends on DTE Energy debt and



securities. Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay
    dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, our ability to
    pay interest and dividends would be restricted.

Environmental laws and liability may be
    costly.

We are subject to numerous environmental
    regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water
    quality, wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and
    hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can
    significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and
    plant down times. These laws and regulations require us to seek
    a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and
    other regulatory approvals. We could be required to install
    expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease
    activities based on these regulations. Additionally, we may
    become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites
    identified by a regulatory body. We cannot predict with
    certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related
    to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating
    clean up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying
    liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and
    several liability on potentially responsible parties.

We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future
    requirements to address climate change issues. Proposals for
    voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed
    both in the United States and worldwide to reduce greenhouse
    gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil
    fuels. If increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are
    implemented, the operations of our fossil-fuel generation assets
    and our unconventional gas production assets may be
    significantly impacted. Since there can be no assurances that
    environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory
    process, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as
    a result of environmental matters.

Renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs
    may affect our business.

We are subject to
    Michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation
    requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy. Under the
    current Michigan legislation we will be required in the future
    to provide a specified percentage of our power from Michigan
    renewable energy sources. We are developing a strategy for
    complying with the existing state legislation, but we do not
    know what requirements may be added by federal legislation. We
    are actively engaged in developing renewable energy projects and
    identifying third party projects in which we can invest. We
    cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with
    these future projects.

We are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy
    efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer
    awareness and education programs. These requirements necessitate
    expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the
    risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy
    usage. We do not know how these programs will impact our
    business and future operating results.

Threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our
    business.

We may be threatened by problems such
    as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations
    and could harm our operating results. Our industry requires the
    continued operation of sophisticated information technology
    systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation
    of security measures, all of our technology systems are
    vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses,
    acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information
    technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in
    a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business
    functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operating results, and financial condition.

In addition, our generation plants, gas pipeline and storage
    facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular
    may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our
    ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy
    products. We have increased security as a result of past events
    and we may be required by our regulators or by the future
    terrorist threat environment to make investments in security
    that we cannot currently predict.

We may not be fully covered by insurance.

We
    have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide
    coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic
    damage as a result of acts of God, terrorism or a combination of
    other significant unforeseen events that could impact our
    operations. Economic losses might not be covered in full by
    insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual
    obligations.

Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable
    information could adversely affect us.

In
    connection with our business we collect and retain personally
    identifiable information of our customers,



shareholders and employees. Our customers, shareholders and
    employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal
    information, and the United States regulatory environment
    surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly
    demanding. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of
    customer, shareholder, employee or DTE Energy data by cybercrime
    or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could
    result in significant costs, fines and litigation.

Benefits of continuous improvement initiatives could be less
    than we expect.

We have a continuous improvement
    program that is expected to result in significant cost savings.
    Actual results achieved through this program could be less than
    our expectations.

A work interruption may adversely affect
    us.

Unions represent approximately 5,000 of our
    employees. A union choosing to strike would have an impact on
    our business. Contracts with several of our unions, including
    our contract with our largest union, representing about 3,800 of
    our employees, expire on different dates throughout 2010. In
    addition, our contracts with unions representing two small
    groups of employees expired on December 31, 2009 and
    another union is currently negotiating its first contract. We
    cannot predict the outcome of any of these contract
    negotiations, some of which have not yet commenced. We are
    unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our
    costs of operation and financial performance.

Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and
    other skilled professional and technical employees could have an
    adverse effect on our operations.

Our business is
    dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate
    employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is
    high and the inability to retain and attract these employees
    could adversely affect our business and future operating results.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are involved in certain legal, regulatory, administrative and
    environmental proceedings before various courts, arbitration
    panels and governmental agencies concerning matters arising in
    the ordinary course of business. These proceedings include
    certain contract disputes, environmental reviews and
    investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and
    pending judicial matters. We cannot predict the final
    disposition of such proceedings. We regularly review legal
    matters and record provisions for claims that are considered
    probable of loss. The resolution of pending proceedings is not
    expected to have a material effect on our operations or
    financial statements in the period they are resolved.

In February 2008, DTE Energy was named as one of approximately
    24 defendant oil, power and coal companies in a lawsuit filed in
    a United States District Court. DTE Energy was served with
    process in March 2008. The plaintiffs, the Native Village of
    Kivalina and City of Kivalina, which are home to approximately
    400 people in Alaska, claim that the defendants’
    business activities have contributed to global warming and, as a
    result, higher temperatures are damaging the local economy and
    leaving the island more vulnerable to storm activity in the fall
    and winter. As a result, the plaintiffs are seeking damages of
    up to $400 million for relocation costs associated with
    moving the village to a safer location, as well as unspecified
    attorney’s fees and expenses. On October 15, 2009, the
    U.S. District Court granted defendants’ motions
    dismissing all of plaintiffs’ federal claims in the case on
    two independent grounds: (1) the court lacks subject matter
    jurisdiction to hear the claims because of the political
    question doctrine; and (2) plaintiffs lack standing to
    bring their claims. The court also dismissed plaintiffs’
    state law claims because the court lacked supplemental
    jurisdiction over them after it dismissed the federal claims;
    the dismissal of the state law claims was without prejudice. The
    plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the Ninth Circuit.

In July 2009, DTE Energy received a Notice of Violation/Finding
    of Violation (NOV/FOV) from the EPA alleging, among other
    things, that five Detroit Edison power plants violated New
    Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration requirements, and Title V operating permit
    requirements under the Clean Air Act. We believe that the plants
    identified by the EPA have complied with applicable regulations.
    Depending upon the outcome of our discussions with the EPA
    regarding the NOV/FOV, the EPA



could bring legal action against Detroit Edison. We could also
    be required to install additional pollution control equipment at
    some or all of the power plants in question, engage in
    Supplemental Environmental Programs,

and/or

pay
    fines. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this
    matter, or the timing of its resolution.

For additional discussion on legal matters, see Notes 12
    and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this Report.

At December 31, 2009, there were 165,400,045 shares of
    our common stock outstanding. These shares were held by a total
    of 78,903 shareholders of record.

Our Bylaws nullify Chapter 7B of the Michigan Business
    Corporation Act (Act). This Act regulates shareholder rights
    when an individual’s stock ownership reaches 20% of a
    Michigan corporation’s outstanding shares. A shareholder
    seeking control of the Company cannot require our Board of
    Directors to call a meeting to vote on issues related to
    corporate control within 10 days, as stipulated by the Act.

We paid cash dividends on our common stock of $347 million
    in 2009, $344 million in 2008, and $364 million in
    2007. The amount of future dividends will depend on our
    earnings, cash flows, financial condition and other factors that
    are periodically reviewed by our Board of Directors. Although
    there can be no assurances, we anticipate paying dividends for
    the foreseeable future.

See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report for information on
    dividend restrictions.

All of our equity compensation plans that provide for the annual
    awarding of stock-based compensation have been approved by
    shareholders. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for
    additional detail.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

DTE Energy is a diversified energy company with 2009 operating
    revenues in excess of $8 billion and over $24 billion
    in assets. We are the parent company of Detroit Edison and
    MichCon, regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily
    in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales,
    distribution and storage services throughout southeastern
    Michigan. We operate four energy-related non-utility segments
    with operations throughout the United States.

The decrease in 2009 Net income attributable to DTE Energy from
    2008 was primarily due to the $80 million after-tax gain
    recorded in the Unconventional Gas Production segment on the
    2008 sale of a portion of Barnett shale properties, partially
    offset by higher earnings in the Electric Utility and Energy
    Trading segments. The decrease in Net income attributable to DTE
    Energy in 2008 from 2007 was primarily due to $370 million
    in net income resulting from the $580 million after-tax
    gain on the 2007 sale of the Antrim shale gas exploration and
    production business, partially offset by $210 million
    after-tax losses recognized on related hedges, including
    recognition of amounts previously recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income during 2007.

UTILITY
    OPERATIONS

Our Electric Utility segment consists of Detroit Edison, which
    is engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution and sale of
    electricity to approximately 2.1 million customers in
    southeastern Michigan.

Our Gas Utility segment consists of MichCon and Citizens.
    MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage, transmission,
    distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately
    1.2 million customers throughout Michigan. Citizens
    distributes natural gas in Adrian, Michigan to approximately
    17,000 customers.



Impact
    of National and Regional Economic Conditions

Revenues from our utility operations follow the economic cycles
    of the customers we serve. Unfavorable national and regional
    economic trends have resulted in reduced demand for electricity
    and natural gas in our service territory with corresponding
    declines in our revenues.

During 2009, Detroit Edison experienced decreases in sales,
    predominantly in the industrial class, and to a lesser extent in
    the residential and commercial classes, partially offset by
    higher interconnection sales. MichCon’s revenues were lower
    due primarily to lower natural gas costs and customer
    conservation. We expect to minimize the impacts of declines in
    average customer usage through regulatory mechanisms which will
    decouple our revenue levels from sales volumes. We expect to be
    impacted by the challenges in the domestic automotive and steel
    industries and the timing and level of recovery in the national
    and regional economies. Direct and indirect effects of further
    automotive and other industrial plant closures could have a
    significant impact on the results of Detroit Edison. As
    discussed further below, deteriorating economic conditions
    impact our ability to collect amounts due from our electric and
    gas customers and drive increased thefts of electricity and
    natural gas. In the face of these economic conditions, we are
    actively managing our cash, capital expenditures, cost structure
    and liquidity to maintain our financial strength.

Collectibility
    of Accounts Receivable on Utility Operations

Although lower than peak levels in 2008, both utilities continue
    to experience high levels of past due receivables primarily
    attributable to economic conditions. Our service territories
    continue to experience high levels of unemployment,
    underemployment and low income households, home foreclosures and
    a lack of adequate levels of assistance for low-income
    customers. Despite the current economic conditions, total
    arrears were reduced during 2009 in our electric and gas
    utilities. We have taken actions to manage the level of past due
    receivables, including increasing customer disconnections,
    contracting with collection agencies and working with Michigan
    officials and others to increase the share of low-income funding
    allocated to our customers.

Uncollectible Expense

Detroit Edison

$


$


$


MichCon




$

The MPSC has provided for an uncollectible expense tracking
    mechanism for MichCon since 2005. The uncollectible expense
    tracking mechanism enables MichCon to recover or refund
    90 percent of the difference between the actual
    uncollectible expense for each year and $37 million after
    an annual reconciliation proceeding before the MPSC.

The January 2010 MPSC electric rate order provided for an
    uncollectible expense tracking mechanism for Detroit Edison. The
    uncollectible expense tracking mechanism enables Detroit Edison
    to recover or refund 80 percent of the difference between
    the actual uncollectible expense for each year and
    $66 million after an annual reconciliation proceeding
    before the MPSC.

The bankruptcies of General Motors Corporation (GM) and Chrysler
    LLC (Chrysler) did not have a significant impact to our
    uncollectible expense in 2009.



Impact
    of Regulatory Decisions on Utility Operations

On January 11, 2010, the MPSC issued an order in Detroit
    Edison’s January 26, 2009 rate case filing. The MPSC
    approved an annual revenue increase of $217 million or a
    4.8% increase in Detroit Edison’s annual revenue
    requirement for 2010. Included in the approved increase in
    revenues was a return on equity of 11% on an expected 49% equity
    and 51% debt permanent capital structure. Since the final rate
    relief ordered was less than the Company’s self-implemented
    rate increase of $280 million effective on July 26,
    2009, the MPSC ordered refunds for the period the
    self-implemented rates were in effect. Detroit Edison has
    recorded a refund liability of $27 million at
    December 31, 2009 representing the 2009 portion of the
    estimated refund due customers, including interest. The MPSC
    ordered Detroit Edison to file a refund plan by April 1,
    2010.

Other key aspects of the MPSC order include the following:

•

Continued progress toward correcting the existing rate structure
    to more accurately reflect the actual cost of providing service
    to business customers;

•

Continued application of an adjustment mechanism for Electric
    Choice sales that reconciles actual customer choice sales with a
    base customer choice sales level of 1,586 GWh;

•

Continued application of adjustment mechanisms to track expenses
    associated with restoration costs (storm and non-storm related
    expenses) and line clearance expenses. Annual reconciliations
    will be required using a base expense level of $117 million
    and $47 million, respectively. The change in base expense
    level was applied retroactive to the July 26, 2009
    self-implementation date;

•

Implementation of a pilot Revenue Decoupling Mechanism, that
    will compare actual (non-weather normalized) sales per customer
    with the base sales per customer level established in this case
    for the period February 1, 2010 to January 31, 2011;
    and

•

Implementation of an Uncollectible Expense Tracking Mechanism,
    based on a $66 million expense level, with an
    80/20 percent sharing of the expenses above or below the
    base amount. The Uncollectible Expenses Tracking Mechanism was
    implemented retroactive to the July 26, 2009
    self-implementation date.

MichCon filed a general rate case on June 9, 2009 based on
    a 2008 historical test year. The filing with the MPSC requested
    a $193 million, or 11.5 percent average increase in
    MichCon’s annual revenues for a 2010 projected test year.
    The requested $193 million increase in revenues is required
    to recover the increased costs associated with increased
    investments in net plant and working capital, an increase in the
    base level of the uncollectible expense tracking mechanism and
    the cost of natural gas theft primarily due to economic
    conditions in Michigan, sales reductions due to customer
    conservation and the trend of warmer weather on MichCon’s
    market, and increasing operating costs, largely due to
    inflation. Pursuant to the October 2008 Michigan legislation,
    and the settlement in MichCon’s last base gas sale case,
    MichCon self-implemented $170 million of its requested
    annual increase on January 1, 2010. This increase will
    remain in place until a final order is issued by the MPSC, which
    is expected in June 2010, subject to refund. See Note 12 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this Report.

NON-UTILITY
    OPERATIONS

We have significant investments in non-utility businesses. We
    employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing
    opportunities that leverage our assets, skills and expertise.
    Specifically, we invest in targeted energy markets with
    attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in
    alignment with our risk profile. We expect growth opportunities
    in the Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power and Industrial
    Projects segments in the future. Expansion of these businesses
    will also result in our ability to further diversify
    geographically.

Gas Storage and Pipelines owns partnership interests in two
    natural gas storage fields and two interstate pipelines serving
    the Midwest, Ontario and Northeast markets. Much of the growth
    in demand for natural gas is expected to occur in the
    Mid-Atlantic and New England regions. Forecasts indicate that
    these regions will require incremental gas storage and pipeline
    infrastructure to meet demand growth. Our Vector and



Millennium pipelines are well-positioned to provide access
    routes and low-cost expansion options to these markets.

Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural
    gas exploration, development and production within the Barnett
    shale in north Texas. We continue to develop our holdings in the
    western portion of the Barnett shale and to seek opportunities
    for additional monetization of select properties within our
    Barnett shale holdings, when conditions are appropriate. Due to
    economic conditions and low natural gas prices during the year,
    we chose to do minimal lease acquisitions and reduce the number
    of new wells this year. However, we continue to evaluate leasing
    opportunities in active development areas in the Barnett shale
    to optimize our existing portfolio.

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects
    that deliver energy and products and services to industrial,
    commercial and institutional customers; provide coal
    transportation and marketing; and sell electricity from
    biomass-fired energy projects. This business segment provides
    services using project assets usually located on or near the
    customers’ premises in the steel, automotive, pulp and
    paper, airport and other industries. Renewable energy,
    environmental and economic trends are creating growth
    opportunities. The increasing number of states with renewable
    portfolio standards and energy efficiency mandates provides the
    opportunity to market the expertise of the Power and Industrial
    Projects segment in landfill gas,

on-site

energy management, waste-wood power generation, and other
    related services.

Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas
    marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of
    returns from DTE Energy’s asset portfolio, and optimization
    of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage,
    and power transmission and generating capacity positions. Energy
    Trading also provides natural gas, power and ancillary services
    to various utilities which may include the management of
    associated storage and transportation contracts on the
    customers’ behalf.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

Synthetic
    Fuel

The Synthetic Fuel business was presented as a non-utility
    segment through the third quarter of 2007. Due to the expiration
    of synfuel production tax credits at the end of 2007, the
    Synthetic Fuel business ceased operations and was classified as
    a discontinued operation as of December 31, 2007.

CAPITAL
    INVESTMENTS

We anticipate significant capital investments during the next
    three years concentrated primarily in Detroit Edison.

Our utility businesses require significant capital investments
    each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of
    their asset bases, including power generation plants,
    distribution systems, storage fields and other facilities and
    fleets. In addition, Detroit Edison’s investments
    (excluding investments in new base-load generation capacity, if
    any) will be driven by renewable investment and environmental
    controls expenditures. We plan to seek regulatory approval to
    include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate
    base consistent with prior treatment. Non-utility investments
    are expected primarily in continued investment in gas storage
    and pipeline assets and renewable opportunities in the Power and
    Industrial Projects businesses.



ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

We are subject to extensive environmental regulation. Additional
    costs may result as the effects of various substances on the
    environment are studied and governmental regulations are
    developed and implemented. Actual costs to comply could vary
    substantially. We expect to continue recovering environmental
    costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our
    customers.

Air —

Detroit Edison is subject to the EPA
    ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant
    emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Since 2005, EPA
    and the State of Michigan have issued additional emission
    reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate,
    regional haze and mercury air pollution. The new rules will lead
    to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
    nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. Further,
    additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years
    which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide,
    nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants. It is not possible
    to quantify the impact of those expected rulemakings at this
    time.

In July 2009, DTE Energy received a Notice of Violation/Finding
    of Violation (NOV/FOV) from the EPA alleging, among other
    things, that five Detroit Edison power plants violated New
    Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration requirements, and Title V operating permit
    requirements under the Clean Air Act. We believe that the plants
    identified by the EPA have complied with applicable regulations.
    Depending upon the outcome of our discussions with the EPA
    regarding the NOV/FOV, the EPA could bring legal action against
    Detroit Edison. We could also be required to install additional
    pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants
    in question, engage in Supplemental Environmental Programs,

and/or

pay
    fines. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this
    matter, or the timing of its resolution.

Water —

In response to an EPA regulation,
    Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing
    the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures
    at several of its facilities. Based on the results of studies,
    some of which have already been completed, but more are expected
    to be conducted over the next several years, Detroit Edison may
    be required to perform some mitigation activities, including the
    possible installation of additional control technologies to
    reduce the environmental impact of the intake structures.
    However, a January 2007 circuit court decision remanded back to
    the EPA several provisions of the federal regulation, resulting
    in a delay in complying with the regulation. In 2008, the
    U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the remanded
    cost-benefit analysis provision of the rule and in April 2009
    upheld EPA’s use of this provision in determining best
    available technology for reducing environmental impacts.
    Concurrently, the EPA continues to develop a revised rule, a
    draft of which is expected to be published by summer 2010. The
    EPA has also proposed an information collection request to begin
    a review of steam electric effluent guidelines. It is not
    possible at this time to quantify the impacts of these
    developing requirements.

Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) and Other Sites —

Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas
    pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured
    locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. The
    facilities, which produced gas for heating and other uses, have
    been designated as MGP sites. Gas Utility owns, or previously
    owned, fifteen such former MGP sites. Detroit Edison owns, or
    previously owned, three former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP
    sites, we are also in the process of cleaning up other sites
    where contamination is present as a result of historical and
    ongoing utility operations. These other sites include an
    engineered ash storage facility, electrical distribution
    substations, gas pipelines, and underground and aboveground
    storage tank locations. Cleanup activities associated with these
    sites will be conducted over the next several years.

Landfill

— Detroit Edison owns and operates a
    permitted engineered ash storage facility at the Monroe Power
    Plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant.
    Detroit Edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and
    identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and
    reconstruction. The results of the engineering study show that
    the estimated cost to perform the embankment repairs are
    $17 million which we expect to incur over the next four
    years.

The EPA has expressed its intentions to develop new federal
    regulations for coal ash under the authority of the Resources
    Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). A proposed regulation is
    expected in the first



quarter of 2010. Among the options EPA is currently considering,
    is a ruling that may designate coal ash as a “Hazardous
    Waste” as defined by RCRA. However, agencies and
    legislatures have urged EPA to regulate coal ash as a
    non-hazardous waste. If EPA were to designate coal ash as a
    hazardous waste, the agency could apply some, or all, of the
    disposal and reuse standards that have been applied to other
    existing hazardous wastes. Some of the regulatory actions
    currently being contemplated could have a material adverse
    impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we
    charge our customers.

Global
    Climate Change

Climate regulation

and/or

legislation is being proposed and discussed within the
    U.S. Congress and the EPA. On June 26, 2009, the
    U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean
    Energy and Security Act (ACESA). The ACESA includes a cap and
    trade program that would start in 2012 and provides for costs to
    emit greenhouse gases. Despite action by the Senate
    Environmental and Public Works Committee to pass a similar but
    more stringent bill in October 2009, full Senate action on a
    climate bill is not expected before the spring of 2010.
    Meanwhile, the EPA is beginning to implement regulatory actions
    under the Clean Air Act to address emission of greenhouse gases.
    Pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could
    have a material impact on our operations and financial position
    and the rates we charge our customers. Impacts include
    expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is
    currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital
    expenditures and the purchase of emission allowances from market
    sources. We would seek to recover these incremental costs
    through increased rates charged to our utility customers.
    Increased costs for energy produced from traditional sources
    could also increase the economic viability of energy produced
    from renewable

and/or

nuclear sources and energy efficiency initiatives and the
    development of market-based trading of carbon offsets providing
    business opportunities for our utility and non-utility segments.
    It is not possible to quantify these impacts on DTE Energy or
    its customers at this time.

See Notes 12 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report and Items 1 and 2
    Business and Properties.

OUTLOOK

The next few years will be a period of rapid change for DTE
    Energy and for the energy industry. Our strong utility base,
    combined with our integrated non-utility operations, position us
    well for long-term growth.

Looking forward, we will focus on several areas that we expect
    will improve future performance:

•

continuing to pursue regulatory stability and investment
    recovery for our utilities;

•

managing the growth of our utility asset base;

•

enhancing our cost structure across all business segments;

•

managing cash, capital and liquidity to maintain or improve our
    financial strength;

•

improving Electric and Gas Utility customer
    satisfaction; and

•

investing in businesses that integrate our assets and leverage
    our skills and expertise.

We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses
    in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet
    our strategic, financial and risk criteria.

Operation and maintenance

expense decreased
    $45 million in 2009 and decreased $100 million in
    2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to $71 million
    from continuous improvement initiatives and other cost
    reductions resulting in lower contract labor and outside
    services expense, information technology and other staff
    expenses, $14 million of lower employee benefit-related
    expenses, lower storm expenses of $12 million,
    $9 million of reduced uncollectible expenses and
    $6 million of reduced maintenance activities, partially
    offset by higher pension and health care costs of
    $54 million and $14 million of energy optimization and
    renewable energy expenses. The decrease in 2008 was due
    primarily to lower information systems implementation costs of
    $60 million, lower employee benefit-related expenses of
    $45 million and $29 million from continuous
    improvement initiatives resulting in lower contract labor and
    outside services expense, information technology and other staff
    expenses, partially offset by higher uncollectible expenses of
    $22 million.

Depreciation and amortization

expense increased
    $101 million in 2009 due primarily to a higher depreciable
    base and increased amortization of regulatory assets and
    decreased $21 million in 2008 due primarily to decreased
    amortization of regulatory assets.

Taxes other than income

were lower by $27 million
    due primarily to a $30 million reduction in property tax
    expense due to refunds received in settlement of appeals of
    assessments for prior years. Taxes decreased $45 million in
    2008 due to the Michigan Single Business Tax (SBT) expense in
    2007, which was replaced with the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) in
    2008. The MBT is accounted for in the Income Tax provision.

Outlook

— Unfavorable national and regional
    economic trends have resulted in reduced demand for electricity
    in our service territory and continued high levels in our
    uncollectible accounts receivable. The magnitude of these trends
    will be driven by the impacts of the challenges in the domestic
    automotive industry and the timing and level of recovery in the
    national and regional economies. The January 2010 MPSC rate
    order, provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism
    and a revenue decoupling mechanism will assist in mitigating
    these impacts.

To address the challenges of the national and regional
    economies, we continue to move forward in our efforts to improve
    the operating performance and cash flow of Detroit Edison. We
    continue to favorably resolve outstanding regulatory issues,
    many of which were addressed by Michigan legislation. We expect
    that our planned significant environmental and renewable
    expenditures will result in earnings growth. Looking forward, we
    face additional issues, such as higher levels of capital
    spending, volatility in prices for coal and other commodities,
    investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in
    benefit plans and health care costs, and uncertainty of
    legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change. We
    expect to continue



an intense focus on our continuous improvement efforts to
    improve productivity, remove waste and decrease our costs while
    improving customer satisfaction.

Gross margin

decreased $43 million in 2009 and
    increased $63 million in 2008. The decrease in 2009
    reflects $28 million of lower revenues from the
    uncollectible tracking mechanism, $15 million of additional
    lost and stolen gas, $12 million of continued customer
    conservation efforts, $5 million of lower end user
    transportation revenue, $5 million of realized hedging
    losses, the effects of unfavorable weather of $4 million
    and reduced late payment revenue of $4 million, partially
    offset by $22 million higher midstream transportation and
    storage revenues, $5 million in energy optimization
    revenues and $5 million higher appliance service revenues.
    The increase in 2008 reflects $49 million from the
    uncollectible tracking mechanism, $15 million related to
    the impacts of colder weather, $10 million favorable result
    of lower lost gas recognized and higher valued gas received as
    compensation for transportation of third party customer gas,
    $7 million of 2007 GCR disallowances, and $6 million
    of appliance repair revenue. The 2008 improvement was partially
    offset by $19 million of lower storage services revenue and
    $12 million from customer conservation and lower volumes.

expense decreased
    $49 million in 2009 and increased $35 million in 2008.
    The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to $33 million of
    reduced uncollectible expenses, $15 million of lower
    employee benefit-related expenses, $14 million from
    continuous improvement initiatives and other cost reductions
    resulting in lower contract labor and outside services expense,
    information technology and other staff expenses, partially
    offset by higher health care expenses of $8 million and
    $4 million of energy optimization expenses. The 2008
    increase is primarily attributable to $56 million of higher
    uncollectible expenses, partially offset by $14 million
    from continuous improvement initiatives resulting in lower
    contract labor and outside services expense, information
    technology and other staff expenses and $14 million of
    reduced pension and health care expenses. Uncollectible expense
    was higher in 2008 due to an analysis of our greater than ninety
    day receivables that indicated a change in the mix of customers
    in that group and therefore an increased risk of collection. The
    changes in uncollectible expenses are substantially offset by
    changes in revenues from the uncollectible tracking mechanism
    included in the gross margin discussion.

Asset (gains) losses, net

decreased $8 million due
    to a lower gain on the sale of base gas of $15 million and
    a gain related to the sale of certain gathering and processing
    assets. The 2008 increase of $23 million was due primarily
    to the sale of base gas.

Outlook —

Unfavorable national and regional
    economic trends have resulted in a decrease in the number of
    customers in our service territory, customer conservation and
    continued high levels of theft and uncollectible accounts
    receivable. The magnitude of these trends will be driven by the
    impacts of the challenges in the domestic automotive industry
    and the timing and level of recovery in the national and
    regional economies. The uncollectible tracking mechanism
    provided by the MPSC assists in mitigating the continued
    pressure on accounts receivable.

To address the challenges of the national and regional
    economies, we continue to move forward in our efforts to improve
    the operating performance and cash flow of Gas Utility. We
    continue to resolve outstanding regulatory issues. Looking
    forward, we face additional issues, such as volatility in gas
    prices, investment returns and changes in discount rate
    assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs. We expect to
    continue an intense focus on our continuous improvement efforts
    to improve productivity, minimize lost and stolen gas, remove
    waste and decrease our costs while improving customer
    satisfaction.

Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy

$


$


$


Net income attributable to DTE Energy increased $11 million
    and $4 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009
    increase was driven by higher operating revenues resulting from
    increased capacity sold and higher rates from renewing storage
    contracts related to long-term agreements. In addition, there
    were



higher equity earnings from our investments in the Vector and
    Millennium Pipelines, reflecting a first full year of operations
    for Millennium. The 2008 increase is due to higher storage
    revenues related to expansion of capacity and higher other
    income primarily driven by higher equity earnings in the Vector
    and Millennium Pipelines, partially offset by a higher tax
    provision due to the MBT in 2008.

Outlook —

Our Gas Storage and Pipelines
    business expects to continue its steady growth plan. In 2009, an
    additional 3 Bcf of storage capacity was placed in service.
    The Vector Pipeline Phase 2 expansion which added approximately

100 MMcf/day,

was placed in service in October 2009 and is supported by
    customers under long-term contracts. Millennium Pipeline was
    placed in-service in December 2008 and currently has nearly
    85 percent of its capacity sold to customers under
    long-term contracts. We are also a 50 percent owner in the
    proposed Dawn Gateway Pipeline. The Dawn Gateway Project is
    designed to initially transport 360,000 dth/d from our Michigan
    storage facilities to the Dawn Hub in Ontario, Canada, and upon
    successful and timely regulatory approval, is expected to be in
    service in the fourth quarter 2010.

UNCONVENTIONAL
    GAS PRODUCTION

Our Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in natural
    gas exploration, development and production within the Barnett
    shale in northern Texas. In June 2007, we sold our Antrim shale
    gas exploration and production business in northern Michigan for
    gross proceeds of $1.262 billion. In January 2008, we sold
    a portion of our Barnett shale properties for gross proceeds of
    approximately $260 million. The properties sold included
    75 Bcf of proved reserves on approximately 11,000 net
    acres in the core area of the Barnett shale. We recognized a
    gain of $128 million ($80 million after-tax) on the
    sale in 2008.

Operating revenues

decreased $17 million in 2009 and
    increased $276 million in 2008. The 2009 decrease is the
    result of lower commodity prices, while production remained
    relatively flat. The 2008 increase was principally due to the
    impact of losses on 2007 financial contracts that hedged our
    price risk exposure related to expected Antrim gas production
    and sales through 2013. Excluding the impact of the losses on
    the Antrim hedges, operating revenues decreased $47 million
    in 2008. The decreases were principally due to lower natural gas
    sales volumes as a result of our monetization initiatives,
    partially offset by higher commodity prices and higher gas and
    oil production on retained wells.

Operation and maintenance

expense decreased
    $7 million in 2009 due to operational efficiencies and
    lower costs for goods and services. The 2008 decrease is
    primarily attributable to the sale of a portion of the Barnett
    shale in January 2008 and the Antrim sale in June 2007.

Asset (gains) and losses, net

decreased $126 in 2009 and
    increased $147 million in 2008. The 2009 decrease as
    compared to 2008 was due to the gain of $128 million
    ($80 million after-tax) on the 2008 sale of a portion of
    our Barnett shale properties and $2 million lower
    impairment in 2009 of expired or expiring leasehold positions
    that the company does not intend to drill at current commodity
    prices. The increase in 2008 of $147 million was due to the
    gain on sale of Barnett shale core properties, partially offset
    by $8 million



of impairment losses primarily related to leases on unproved
    acreage that we did not anticipate developing due to economic
    conditions.

Outlook —

In the longer-term, we plan to
    continue to develop our holdings in the western portion of the
    Barnett shale and to seek opportunities for additional
    monetization of select properties within our asset base, when
    conditions are appropriate. Our strategy for 2010 is to maintain
    our focus on reducing operating expenses and optimizing
    production volume. During 2010, we expect to invest
    approximately $25 million to drill 10 to 15 new wells and
    achieve production of approximately 5 Bcfe of natural gas,
    compared with 5 Bcfe in 2009.

POWER AND
    INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS

Power and Industrial Projects is comprised primarily of projects
    that deliver energy and utility-type products and services to
    industrial, commercial and institutional customers; provide coal
    transportation services and marketing; and sell electricity from
    biomass-fired energy projects.

Operating revenues

decreased $326 million in 2009
    and $257 million in 2008. The 2009 decrease is due
    primarily to $111 million reduction in certain coal
    structured transactions, $176 million of lower pricing and
    volumes of coal and emissions and $84 million of lower coke
    demand, partially offset by a $107 million increase in coal
    related services. The 2008 decrease was primarily attributable
    to $177 million of reductions in coal transportation and
    trading volumes and $28 million for the impact of a
    customer electing to purchase coal directly from the supplier.

Operation and maintenance

expense decreased
    $306 million in 2009 and $244 million in 2008. The
    2009 decrease is due primarily to $111 million decrease in
    certain coal structured transactions and $64 million of
    lower coke demand, $141 million of lower pricing and
    volumes of coal and emissions and operating expenses, partially
    offset by $75 million of higher coal related services. The
    2008 decrease mostly reflects $174 million of lower coal
    transportation costs driven by reduced sales combined with a
    reduction in coal trading results.

Depreciation and amortization

expense increased
    $6 million in 2009 and decreased $7 million in 2008.
    In 2007, we announced our plans to sell a 50% interest in a
    portfolio of select Power and Industrial Projects. As a result,
    the assets and liabilities of the Projects were classified as
    held for sale at that time and the Company ceased recording
    depreciation and amortization expense related to these assets.
    During the second quarter of 2008, our work on this planned
    monetization was discontinued and the assets and liabilities of
    the Projects



were no longer classified as held for sale. Depreciation and
    amortization resumed in June 2008 when the assets were
    reclassified as held and used.

Other assets (gains) losses, reserves and impairments,
    net

increased $12 million in 2009 and expense decreased
    $6 million in 2008. This variation in this item is due
    primarily to a loss recorded in 2008 of approximately
    $19 million related to the valuation adjustment for the
    cumulative depreciation and amortization upon reclassification
    of certain project assets as held and used, partially offset by
    gains attributable to the sale of one of our coke battery
    projects where the proceeds were dependent on future production.
    Production at this coke battery was operating at lower
    production volumes in 2009.

Other (income) and deductions

were lower by
    $19 million in 2009 due primarily to higher inter-company
    interest associated with project construction and a reduction in
    equity earnings in an investment in a coke battery.

Outlook

— The stabilization in the
    U.S. economy is having a positive impact on our customers
    in the steel industry and we expect a corresponding improvement
    in demand for metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to
    these customers for 2010. We supply onsite energy services to
    the domestic automotive manufacturers who have also experienced
    stabilized demand for autos. Chrysler and GM have emerged from
    Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We have been in
    discussions with both automakers and do not anticipate
    significant impacts to onsite energy services. Our onsite energy
    services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the
    terms of long-term contracts. We continue to monitor
    developments in this sector.

In 2010, we will continue to capture benefits from production
    tax credits generated from our steel industry fuel and our
    reduced emission fuel projects. We will also begin to generate
    production tax credits from our reduced emission fuel projects.
    In 2011, our existing long-term rail transportation contract,
    which is at rates significantly below the current market, will
    expire and we anticipate a decrease in transportation-related
    revenue of approximately $120 million as a result. We will
    continue to work with suppliers and the railroads to promote
    secure and competitive access to coal to meet the energy
    requirements of our customers. Power and Industrial Projects
    will continue to leverage its extensive energy-related operating
    experience and project management capability to develop
    additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial
    customers. We will also continue to look for opportunities to
    acquire energy projects and biomass fired generating projects
    for favorable prices.

ENERGY
    TRADING

Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas
    marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of
    returns from DTE Energy’s asset portfolio, and optimization
    of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage,
    and power transmission and generating capacity positions. Energy
    Trading also provides natural gas, power and ancillary services
    to various utilities which may include the management of
    associated storage and transportation contracts on the
    customers’ behalf.

Gross margin

increased $48 million in 2009 and
    $35 million in 2008. Overall, Operating Revenues and Fuel,
    Purchased Power and Gas were impacted by a decrease in gas and
    power commodity prices in 2009 as compared to 2008. The
    $48 million increase in gross margin in 2009 was due to
    increases in realized margins of $69 million, offset by
    decreases in unrealized margins of $21 million. The
    $69 million increase in realized margins was primarily the
    result of increases in our gas trading strategy and
    timing-related increases in our gas storage and transportation
    optimization strategies. The $21 million decrease in
    unrealized margins consisted of unfavorable results of
    $58 million from our gas trading and gas marketing and
    origination strategies, partially offset by increases of
    $29 million in our power trading and timing-related
    improvements of $8 million in our oil strategies.

The 2008 increase was due to higher unrealized margin of
    $66 million offset by a decrease in realized margin of
    $31 million. The increase in unrealized margins includes
    gains in our gas strategies and the absence of $30 million
    in

mark-to-market

losses in June 2007 reflecting revisions of valuation estimates
    for natural gas contracts. The decrease in realized margin was
    due to unfavorable results of $28 million primarily from
    our power marketing and transmission optimization strategies,
    $34 million of unfavorability in our gas storage and full
    requirements strategies due to falling prices in 2008, offset by
    $31 million of improvement in our gas trading strategy.

Operation and maintenance

expense increased
    $3 million and $10 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The 2009 increase was due to higher payroll and
    incentive costs and commissions, partially offset by lower
    contractor expense and allocated corporate costs. The 2008
    increase is due to higher payroll and incentive costs and
    allocated corporate costs.

Income tax provision

increased $6 million in 2009
    due to an increase in income taxes resulting from higher pretax
    income, partially offset by $10 million of favorable
    tax-related adjustments primarily resulting from the settlement
    of federal income tax audits.

Outlook —

Significant portions of the Energy
    Trading portfolio are economically hedged. The portfolio
    includes financial instruments, physical commodity contracts and
    gas inventory, as well as contracted natural gas pipeline
    transportation and storage, and power transmission and
    generation capacity positions. Energy Trading also provides
    power and ancillary services and natural gas to various
    utilities which may include the management of associated storage
    and transport contracts on the customers’ behalf. Most
    financial instruments and physical power and gas contracts are
    deemed derivatives, whereas proprietary gas inventory, power
    transmission, pipeline transportation and certain storage assets
    are not derivatives. As a result, we will experience earnings
    volatility as derivatives are

marked-to-market

without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and
    assets. Our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of
    these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with
    futures, forwards, swaps and options. This results in gains and
    losses that are recognized in different interim and annual
    accounting periods.

CORPORATE &
    OTHER

Corporate & Other includes various holding company
    activities and holds certain non-utility debt and energy-related
    investments.

Factors impacting income:

The 2009 net
    loss of $70 million decreased from the net loss of
    $94 million in 2008 due to $34 million favorable
    tax-related adjustments primarily resulting from the settlement
    of federal income tax audits, $10 million lower
    inter-company interest expense and $9 million lower costs
    related to natural gas forward contracts associated with the
    2007 sale of the Antrim Shale properties. These favorable
    variances were partially offset by a $10 million donation
    of cash and

available-for-sale

securities to the DTE Energy Foundation, $10 million
    resulting from a realignment of employee benefit expense from
    MichCon, $7 million increase in financing fees,
    $1 million increased impairment of investments and a
    $1 million decrease in interest income. The 2008 net
    loss of $94 million was lower than the 2007 net income
    of $502 million due to the 2007 gain on the sale of the
    Antrim shale gas exploration and production business for
    approximately $900 million ($580 million after-tax).

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

Synthetic
    Fuel

Due to the expiration of synfuel production tax credits in 2007,
    the Synthetic Fuel business ceased operations and was classified
    as a discontinued operation as of December 31, 2007.

See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

CUMULATIVE
    EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted ASC 820
    (SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements)

. The
    cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of ASC 820
    represented a $4 million increase to the January 1,
    2008 balance of retained earnings. See also the “Fair
    Value” section.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted ASC 740 (FASB
    Interpretation No. (FIN) 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109)

. The cumulative effect of the adoption of ASC
    740 represented a $5 million reduction to the
    January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.

CAPITAL
    RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Cash
    Requirements

We use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas
    utilities and to grow our non-utility businesses, retire and pay
    interest on long-term debt and pay dividends. We believe that we
    will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to
    fund anticipated capital and operating requirements. In 2010, we
    expect that cash from operations will be lower due to higher tax
    payments and working capital requirements. We anticipate base
    level capital investments and expenditures for existing
    businesses in 2010 of up to $1.4 billion. The capital needs
    of our utilities will increase due primarily to renewable and
    energy optimization related expenditures. We incurred
    environmental expenditures of approximately $116 million in
    2009 and we expect over $2.2 billion of future capital
    expenditures through 2019 to satisfy both existing and proposed
    new requirements. We plan to seek regulatory approval to include
    these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base
    consistent with prior treatment. Capital spending for growth of
    existing or new non-utility businesses will depend on the
    existence of opportunities that meet our strict risk-return and
    value creation criteria.

Debt maturing in 2010 totals approximately $661 million.

Cash
    from Operating Activities

A majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our
    electric and gas utilities, which are significantly influenced
    by factors such as weather, electric Customer Choice, regulatory
    deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions and
    operating costs.

Cash from operations totaling $1.8 billion in 2009,
    increased $260 million from the comparable 2008 period. The
    operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects lower working
    capital requirements and higher net income after adjusting for
    non-cash and non-operating items (depreciation, depletion and
    amortization, deferred taxes and gains on sales of assets).

Cash from operations totaling $1.6 billion in 2008
    increased $434 million from the comparable 2007 period. The
    operating cash flow comparison primarily reflects higher net
    income after adjusting for non-cash and non-operating items
    (depreciation, depletion and amortization, deferred taxes and
    gains on sales of assets), and cash payments received related to
    our synfuel program hedges.



Cash
    from Investing Activities

Cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily
    generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are
    primarily generated from plant and equipment expenditures. In
    any given year, we will look to realize cash from
    under-performing or non-strategic assets or matured fully valued
    assets. Capital spending within the utility business is
    primarily to maintain our generation and distribution
    infrastructure, comply with environmental regulations and gas
    pipeline replacements. Capital spending within our non-utility
    businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion. The balance
    of non-utility spending is for growth, which we manage very
    carefully. We look to make investments that meet strict criteria
    in terms of strategy, management skills, risks and returns. All
    new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash
    payback on a risk adjusted basis. We have been disciplined in
    how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they
    meet our criteria. For new business lines, we initially invest
    based on research and analysis. We start with a limited
    investment, we evaluate results and either expand or exit the
    business based on those results. In any given year, the amount
    of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash
    flows of the Company with a clear understanding of any potential
    impact on our credit ratings.

Net cash used for investing activities was approximately
    $1.1 billion in 2009, compared with net cash used for
    investing activities of $1.5 billion in 2008. The change
    was primarily driven by reduced capital expenditures by our
    utility and non-utility businesses and the completion of refund
    payments to our synfuel partners in 2008.

Net cash used for investing activities increased
    $1.9 billion in 2008, due primarily to the sale of our
    Antrim shale gas exploration and production business in 2007
    which offset most of the capital expenditures during that
    period, and the completion of synfuel partner refunds in 2008.

Cash
    from Financing Activities

We rely on both short-term borrowing and long-term financing as
    a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied
    by our operations.

Our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed
    and variable interest rates and maturity. We continually
    evaluate our leverage target, which is currently 50% to 52%, to
    ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong
    investment grade debt rating. We have completed a number of
    refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity
    of our long-term debt and strengthening our balance sheet. The
    extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest
    rates that lowered our debt costs.

Net cash used for financing activities was $789 million in
    2009, compared to net cash used for financing activities of
    approximately $84 million for the same period in 2008. The
    change was primarily attributable to lower proceeds from the
    issuance of long-term debt.

Net cash used for financing activities decreased
    $1.4 billion in 2008 primarily related to the repurchase of
    common stock in 2007 and increased issuances of long-term debt.

Outlook

We expect cash flow from operations to increase over the
    long-term primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and
    the non-utility businesses. We expect growth in our utilities to
    be driven primarily by new and existing state and federal
    regulations that will result in additional environmental and
    renewable energy investments which will increase the base from
    which rates are determined. Our non-utility growth is expected
    from additional investments in energy projects as economic
    conditions improve.

We have been impacted by unfavorable national and regional
    economic trends that have reduced demand for electricity in our
    service territory. We may be impacted by the delayed collection
    of underrecoveries of our PSCR and GCR costs and electric and
    gas accounts receivable as a result of MPSC orders. Energy
    prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to
    working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We are
    continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash
    flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining
    flexibility in the timing and extent of our long-term capital
    projects.



In April 2009, we completed an early renewal of
    $975 million of our syndicated revolving credit facilities
    before their scheduled expiration in October 2009. The new
    $1 billion two-year facility will expire in 2011 and has
    similar covenants to the prior facility. A new two-year
    $50 million credit facility was completed in May 2009 and a
    new one-year $70 million credit facility was completed in
    June 2009. We have a $925 million five-year facility that
    expires in October 2010. We expect to pursue the renewal of that
    facility before its expiration. Given current conditions in the
    credit markets, we anticipate that the new facility will be
    similar to our April 2009 facility with respect to such items as
    bank participation, allocation levels and covenants. We are
    evaluating the need to renew our $70 million bi-lateral
    credit facility expiring in June 2010 which is used to support
    the issuance of letters of credit. See Note 18 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

As a result of losses experienced in the 2008 financial markets,
    our benefit plan assets experienced negative returns, which have
    resulted in higher benefit costs and contributions in 2009 and
    potentially in future years relative to the recent past. During
    2009, our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans
    assets experienced positive returns of approximately 20% and
    22%, respectively. During 2010, we expect to contribute up to
    $200 million to our pension plans and up to
    $130 million to our postretirement medical and life
    insurance benefit plans.

While the impact of continued market volatility and turmoil in
    the credit markets cannot be predicted, we believe we have
    sufficient operating flexibility, cash resources and funding
    sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet
    our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs.
    However, virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive,
    or require access to capital, and the inability to access
    adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows.

See Notes 12, 13, and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

    table above as such amounts are discretionary. Planned funding
    levels are disclosed in the Critical Accounting Estimates
    section of MD&A and in Note 21 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Credit
    Ratings

Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market
    participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality
    of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities. Management believes that our current credit ratings
    provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However,
    disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically
    related to us may affect our ability to access these funding
    sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors.

As part of the normal course of business, Detroit Edison,
    MichCon and various non-utility subsidiaries of the Company
    routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts
    for the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal,
    capacity, storage and other energy-related products and
    services. Certain of these contracts contain provisions which
    allow the counterparties to request that the Company post cash
    or letters of credit in the event that the credit rating of DTE
    Energy is downgraded below investment grade. Certain of these
    contracts for Detroit Edison and MichCon contain similar
    provisions in the event that the credit rating of the particular
    utility is downgraded below investment grade. The amount of such
    collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon
    commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the
    underlying transactions and could be substantial. Also, upon a
    downgrade below investment grade, we could have restricted
    access to the commercial paper market and if DTE Energy is
    downgraded below investment grade our non-utility businesses,
    especially the Energy Trading and Power and Industrial Projects
    segments, could be required to restrict operations due to a lack
    of available liquidity. A downgrade below investment grade could
    potentially increase the borrowing costs of DTE Energy and its
    subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets. The
    impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability to comply with
    our existing debt covenants. While we currently do not
    anticipate such a downgrade, we cannot predict the outcome of
    current or future credit rating agency reviews.

In May 2009, Standard & Poor’s Rating Group
    (Standard & Poor’s) revised the outlook on DTE
    Energy and its subsidiaries to negative from stable, and lowered
    the short-term corporate credit and commercial paper ratings for
    DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon to

A-3

from

A-2.

The
    revision was primarily due to concerns over Michigan’s
    economic climate. Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s)
    affirmed our existing short-term ratings of

P-2.

In
    August 2009, Moody’s upgraded the majority of senior
    secured debt ratings of investment-grade regulated utilities by
    one notch as a result of revised notching guidelines between
    senior secured debt ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings.
    Both Detroit Edison’s and MichCon’s senior debt
    ratings were upgraded to A2 from A3. In January 2010,
    Standard & Poor’s raised its outlook on DTE
    Energy back to stable and raised the short-term credit ratings
    for DTE Energy, Detroit Edison and MichCon back to

A-2

from

A-3.

We have
    experienced an improvement in our ability to issue commercial
    paper since the restoration of our short-term ratings.
    Short-term borrowings, principally in the form of commercial
    paper, provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis.
    Our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured
    credit facilities. Potential instability in the credit markets
    and any lowering of ratings may impact future access to the
    commercial paper markets, which may require us to draw on our

back-up

facilities.



The following table shows our credit rating as determined by
    three nationally recognized credit rating agencies. All ratings

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles require that management
    apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions
    that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and
    liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management
    believes that the areas described below require significant
    judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making
    estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently
    uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional
    discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this Report.

Regulation

A significant portion of our business is subject to regulation.
    This results in differences in the application of generally
    accepted accounting principles between regulated and
    non-regulated businesses. Detroit Edison and MichCon are
    required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain
    transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense
    in non-regulated businesses. Future regulatory changes or
    changes in the competitive environment could result in the
    discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory
    assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses.
    Management believes that currently available facts support the
    continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all
    regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable
    in the current rate environment.

See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as
    Derivative Assets or Liabilities in the Consolidated Statements
    of Financial Position. Changes in the fair value of the
    derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period
    of change, unless the derivative meets certain defined
    conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge. The normal
    purchases and normal sales exception requires, among other
    things, physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or
    sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business.
    Contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal
    sales are not recorded at fair value. Substantially all of the
    commodity contracts entered into by Detroit Edison and MichCon
    meet the criteria specified for this exception.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date
    in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a
    market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs,
    which



refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in
    pricing assets and liabilities. These inputs can be readily
    observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable
    inputs. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined
    from a combination of active quotes, published indexes and
    mathematical valuation models. We generally derive the pricing
    for our contracts from active quotes or external resources.
    Actively quoted indexes include exchange-traded positions such
    as the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental
    Exchange, and

over-the-counter

positions for which broker quotes are available. For periods in
    which external market data is not readily observable, we
    estimate value using mathematical valuation models. Valuation
    models require various inputs and assumptions, including forward
    prices, volatility, interest rates, and exercise periods. For
    those inputs which are not observable, we use model-based
    extrapolation, proxy techniques or historical analysis to derive
    the required valuation inputs. We periodically update our policy
    and valuation methodologies for changes in market liquidity and
    other assumptions which may impact the estimated fair value of
    our derivative contracts.

The fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change
    significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new
    information. Actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may
    be different from the results we estimate using models. As fair
    value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity
    prices, we perform sensitivity analysis on the fair values of
    our forward contracts. See sensitivity analysis in Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See
    also the Fair Value section, herein. See Notes 4 and 5 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this report.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on
    historical losses and management’s assessment of existing
    economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. The
    allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is
    calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates
    developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past
    due receivable balances. As a result of the reduction in past
    due receivables in 2009, our allowance for doubtful accounts
    decreased in 2009 compared to an increase in 2008. We believe
    the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable
    estimates. As part of the 2005 gas rate order for MichCon, the
    MPSC provided for the establishment of an uncollectible expense
    tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact
    associated with MichCon uncollectible expenses. The MPSC
    provided for a similar tracking mechanism for Detroit Edison in
    its rate order received January 2010. However, failure to make
    continued progress in collecting our past due receivables in
    light of volatile energy prices and deteriorating economic
    conditions would unfavorably affect operating results and cash
    flow.

    Impairments

Goodwill

Certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated
    goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations. We
    perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with
    goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate
    that the value of goodwill may be impaired. In performing Step 1
    of the impairment test, we compare the fair value of the
    reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. If the
    carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value
    of a reporting unit, Step 2 of the test would be performed. Step
    2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill
    to be reduced to its fair value, if lower, as of the test date.

For Step 1 of the test, we estimate the reporting unit’s
    fair value using standard valuation techniques, including
    techniques which use estimates of projected future results and
    cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. Such
    techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an
    earnings multiple approach, which incorporates the current
    market values of comparable entities. These cash flow valuations
    involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and
    significant judgment by management regarding future performance.
    We also employ market-based valuation techniques to test the
    reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting
    units determined under the cash flow technique.

We performed our annual impairment test as of October 1,
    2009 and determined that the estimated fair value of each
    reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment
    existed. We also compared the



aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall
    market capitalization. The implied premium of the aggregate fair
    value over market capitalization is likely attributable to
    factors such as (1) an acquisition control premium (the
    price in excess of a stock’s market price that investors
    typically pay to gain control of an entity), and (2) the
    market’s apparent discounting of DTE Energy’s stock
    price due to ongoing uncertainty regarding the existing
    regulatory and automotive industry environment and DTE
    Energy’s diverse non-utility business portfolio. The
    results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are
    as follows.

The Gas Utility reporting unit passed Step 1 of the impairment
    test by a narrow margin. The narrow excess of fair value over
    carrying value is largely due to relatively low market values
    and market multiples of comparable entities referenced in our
    valuation. Further declines in market multiples, negative
    regulatory actions or other disruptions in cash flows for the
    Gas Utility reporting unit could result in an impairment charge
    in the foreseeable future. For example, at the current discount
    rate and holding all other variables constant, a 0.5x decrease
    in the terminal multiple would lower the fair value by
    approximately $130 million. At the lower fair value, the
    Gas Utility reporting unit would likely fail Step 1 of the test
    potentially resulting in a charge for impairment of goodwill
    following completion of the Step 2 analysis.

We perform an annual impairment test each October. In between
    annual tests, we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding
    estimated future cash flows, including the impact of movements
    in market indicators in future quarters and will update our
    impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs. While we
    believe our assumptions are reasonable, actual results may
    differ from our projections. To the extent projected results or
    cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be
    required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill, which
    would adversely impact our earnings.

We monitor DTE Energy’s stock price in relation to its book
    value per share. DTE’s stock price declined significantly
    during the first quarter of 2009 and then increased and
    continued to recover throughout the rest of 2009. Refer to
    Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this Report, for a discussion of factors that we
    considered when assessing triggering events in 2009.



Due to the duration and severity of the decline in DTE
    Energy’s stock price in the first quarter, we performed an
    interim impairment test for all reporting units with allocated
    goodwill as of February 28, 2009. For the first quarter
    interim test, we updated projected future results, cash flows
    and discount rates to reflect existing regulatory actions and
    negative impacts from the deterioration in the regional and
    national economy. Terminal values that utilize an earnings
    multiple approach were updated to incorporate the current market
    values of comparable entities. As compared to the annual test
    performed in the fourth quarter of 2008, the valuations were
    negatively impacted by existing market factors with particular
    downward pressure on market multiples. All reporting units
    passed Step 1 of the impairment test.

We identified a trigger for our Energy Services reporting unit
    related to long-lived asset impairment tests that were performed
    during the second quarter on certain automotive-related project
    companies. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its
    carrying value including goodwill, therefore, the reporting unit
    passed Step 1 of the impairment test. As compared to the first
    quarter interim test, the second quarter valuation was favorably
    impacted by increased market multiples and an improved discount
    rate.

Long-Lived
    Assets

We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets,
    excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable.
    Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows
    and fair value of the long-lived assets are deteriorating
    business climate, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of
    the asset before the end of its useful life. The review of
    long-lived assets for impairment requires significant
    assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future
    cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected
    market conditions. An impairment evaluation is based on an
    undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which
    independent cash flows of long-lived assets can be identified
    from other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment may
    occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future
    undiscounted cash flows. When the undiscounted cash flow
    analysis indicates a long-lived asset is not recoverable, the
    amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the
    excess of the long-lived asset over its fair value. An
    impairment would require us to reduce both the long-lived asset
    and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment,
    which would adversely impact our earnings. See Note 10 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this Report.

The Company’s Power and Industrial Projects segment has
    long-term contracts with GM to provide onsite energy services at
    certain of its manufacturing and administrative facilities. The
    long-term contracts provide for full recovery of its investment
    in the event of early termination. At December 31, 2009,
    the book value of long-lived assets used in the servicing of
    these facilities was approximately $65 million. Certain of
    these long-lived assets have been funded by non-recourse
    financing totaling approximately $56 million at
    December 31, 2009. The Company’s Power and Industrial
    Projects segment also has an equity investment of approximately
    $51 million in an entity which provides onsite services to
    Chrysler manufacturing facilities. Chrysler’s performance
    under the long-term contracts for services is guaranteed by
    Daimler North America Corporation (Daimler), a subsidiary of
    Daimler AG. The long-term contracts and the supporting Daimler
    guarantee provide for full recovery of the Company’s
    investment in the event of early termination or default.
    Chrysler has announced the closure of one site that is under a
    long-term service contract with the Company. Through
    December 31, 2009, to the extent that Chrysler has not been
    performing in accordance with its contracts, Daimler has been
    performing under its guarantee. Therefore, the Company believes
    that it will recover its investment in the event of a facility
    closure or a Chrysler default.

The Company determined that the GM and Chrysler bankruptcy
    filings were triggering events to assess certain
    automotive-related long-lived assets for impairment and as of
    June 30, 2009, the Company performed an impairment analysis
    on these assets. Based on its undiscounted cash flow projections
    and fair value calculations, the Company determined that it did
    not have an impairment loss at June 30, 2009. We also
    determined that we did not have an other than temporary decline
    in our Chrysler-related equity investment. There were no new
    events occurring during the third and fourth quarters that would
    negatively impact the assumptions made for the second quarter
    impairment analysis. Therefore, no triggering events were
    identified during the remainder of 2009. The Company’s
    assumptions and conclusions may change in the future, and we
    could have an impairment loss if certain facilities are not
    utilized as currently anticipated.



Pension
    and Postretirement Costs

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and postretirement
    benefit plans for substantially all of the employees of the
    Company. The measurement of the plan obligations and cost of
    providing benefits under these plans involve various factors,
    including numerous assumptions and accounting elections. When
    determining the various assumptions that are required, we
    consider historical information as well as future expectations.
    The benefit costs are affected by, among other things, the
    actual rate of return on plan assets, the long-term expected
    return on plan assets, the discount rate applied to benefit
    obligations, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining
    service period of plan participants, level of compensation and
    rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service,
    the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs and the
    level of benefits provided to employees and retirees. Pension
    and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are
    included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects
    within the segments, some of which are capitalized.

We had pension costs for pension plans of $58 million in
    2009, $24 million in 2008, and $76 million in 2007.
    Postretirement benefits costs for all plans were
    $205 million in 2009, $142 million in 2008 and
    $188 million in 2007. Pension and postretirement benefits
    costs for 2009 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial
    assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on
    our plan assets of 8.75%. In developing our expected long-term
    rate of return assumption, we evaluated asset class risk and
    return expectations, as well as inflation assumptions. Projected
    returns are based on broad equity, bond and other markets. Our
    2010 expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is
    based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active
    investment management of 45% in equity markets, 25% in fixed
    income markets, and 30% invested in other assets. Because of
    market volatility, we periodically review our asset allocation
    and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate. Given
    market conditions, we believe that 8.75% is a reasonable
    long-term rate of return on our plan assets for 2010. We will
    continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our
    expected rate of return, at least annually.

We calculate the expected return on pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected
    return on plan assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan
    assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration
    anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be
    made during the year. Current accounting rules provide that the
    MRV of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated
    value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and
    rational manner over not more than five years. For our pension
    plans, we use a calculated value when determining the MRV of the
    pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a
    three-year period. Accordingly, the future value of assets will
    be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are
    recognized. Financial markets in 2009 contributed to our
    investment performance resulting in unrecognized net gains. As
    of December 31, 2009, we had $612 million of
    cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the
    calculation of the MRV of pension assets. For our postretirement
    benefit plans, we use fair value when determining the MRV of
    postretirement benefit plan assets, therefore all investment
    losses and gains have been recognized in the calculation of MRV
    for these plans.

The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension
    and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve
    approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two
    highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. The yield
    curve approach matches projected plan pension and postretirement
    benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual
    liability duration unique to our plans. The discount rate
    determined on this basis decreased from 6.9% at
    December 31, 2008 to 5.9% at December 31, 2009. We
    estimate that our 2010 total pension costs will approximate
    $110 million compared to $58 million in 2009 due to
    2008 financial market losses and a decreased discount rate,
    partially offset by substantial 2009 and planned 2010
    contributions coupled with greater than expected 2009 financial
    market returns. Our 2010 postretirement benefit costs will
    approximate $167 million compared to $205 million in
    2009 primarily due to company specific health care trends and
    favorable 2009 investment returns, mitigated by a decreased
    discount rate. Future actual pension and postretirement benefit
    costs will depend on future investment performance, changes in
    future discount rates and various other factors related to plan
    design. The pension cost tracking mechanism that provided for
    recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below amounts
    reflected in Detroit Edison’s base rates, at the request of
    Detroit Edison, was not reauthorized by the MPSC in its rate
    order effective



January 1, 2009. In April 2005, the MPSC approved the
    deferral of the non-capitalized portion of MichCon’s
    negative pension expense. MichCon records a regulatory liability
    for any negative pension costs, as determined under generally
    accepted accounting principles.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on our plan
    assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2009
    pension costs by approximately $29 million. Lowering the
    discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one
    percentage point would have increased our 2009 pension costs by
    approximately $15 million. Lowering the health care cost
    trend assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased
    our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for 2009
    by approximately $30 million.

In 2008, we changed the measurement date of our pension and
    postretirement benefit plans from November 30 to
    December 31. As a result we recognized adjustments of
    $17 million ($9 million after-tax) and $4 million
    to retained earnings and regulatory liabilities, respectively,
    which represents approximately one month of pension and other
    postretirement benefit cost for the period from December 1,
    2007 to December 31, 2008.

The value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets
    was $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009 and
    $2.8 billion at December 31, 2008. At
    December 31, 2009 our pension plans were underfunded by
    $887 million and our other postretirement benefit plans
    were underfunded by $1.3 billion. The 2009 and 2008 funding
    levels were generally similar because of positive investment
    performance returns and plan sponsor contributions in 2009,
    largely offset by the decreased discount rates.

Pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding
    requirements may increase in future years without typical
    returns in the financial markets. We made contributions to our
    pension plans of $200 million and $100 million in 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Also, we contributed $100 million
    to our pension plans in January 2010. At the discretion of
    management, consistent with the Pension Protection Act of 2006,
    and depending upon financial market conditions, we anticipate
    making up to an additional $100 million contribution to our
    pension plans in 2010 and up to $1.1 billion over the next
    five years. We made postretirement benefit plan contributions of
    $205 million and $116 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. We are required by orders issued by the MPSC to
    make postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the
    amounts included in Detroit Edison’s and MichCon’s
    base rates. As a result, we expect to make up to a
    $130 million contribution to our postretirement plans in
    2010 and, subject to MPSC funding requirements, up to
    $765 million over the next five years. The planned
    contributions will be made in cash, DTE Energy common stock or a
    combination of cash and stock.

See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Legal
    Reserves

We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and
    litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We
    regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection
    with asserted or potential matters, and establish reserves when
    appropriate. Legal reserves are based upon management’s
    assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and
    claims against us.

Insured
    and Uninsured Risks

Our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for
    various types of risks. Our insurance policies cover risk of
    loss including property damage, general liability, workers’
    compensation, auto liability, and directors’ and
    officers’ liability. Under our risk management policy, we
    self-insure portions of certain risks up to specified limits,
    depending on the type of exposure. The maximum self-insured
    retention for various risks is as follows: property damage-
    $10 million, general liability- $7 million,
    workers’ compensation- $9 million, and auto liability-
    $7 million. We have an actuarially determined estimate of
    our incurred but not reported (IBNR) liability prepared annually
    and we adjust our reserves for self-insured risks as
    appropriate. As of December 31, 2009, this IBNR liability
    was approximately $38 million.



Accounting
    for Tax Obligations

We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax
    effects of various financial transactions and results of
    operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing
    authorities. We account for uncertain income tax positions using
    a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a
    more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement
    attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of
    tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
    upon ultimate settlement. If the benefit does not meet the more
    likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical
    merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions
    that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax
    return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. We
    also have non-income tax obligations related to property, sales
    and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals related
    to these tax matters.

Accounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including
    assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be
    sustained, and estimating reserves for potential adverse
    outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. We also
    assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in
    the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already
    been reflected in the financial statements. We do not record
    valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital
    losses that we believe will be realized in future periods. We
    believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 are
    appropriately accounted. The ultimate outcome of such matters
    could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our
    consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be
    material.

See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

FAIR
    VALUE

Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as
    Derivative Assets or Liabilities. Contracts we typically
    classify as derivative instruments include power, gas, oil and
    certain coal forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign
    exchange contracts. Items we do not generally account for as
    derivatives include proprietary gas inventory, gas storage and
    transportation arrangements, and gas and oil reserves. See
    Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

As a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting
    principles, the tables below do not include the expected
    earnings impact of non-derivative gas storage, transportation
    and power contracts. Consequently, gains and losses from these
    positions may not match with the related physical and financial
    hedging instruments in some reporting periods, resulting in
    volatility in DTE Energy’s reported

period-by-period

earnings; however, the financial impact of the timing
    differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery

and/or

settlement.

The Company manages its

mark-to-market

(MTM) risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period
    of its contracts and the individual components of the risks
    within each contract. Accordingly, it records and manages the
    energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in
    separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or
    gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or
    off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the
    risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period
    (e.g. by month and year). The following tables contain the four
    categories of activities represented by their operating
    characteristics and key risks:

•

Economic Hedges

— Represents derivative
    activity associated with assets owned and contracted by DTE
    Energy, including forward sales of gas production and trades
    associated with owned transportation and storage capacity.
    Changes in the value of derivatives in this category
    economically offset changes in the value of underlying
    non-derivative positions, which do not qualify for fair value
    accounting. The difference in accounting treatment of
    derivatives in this category and the underlying non-derivative
    positions can result in significant earnings volatility.



•

Structured Contracts

— Represents derivative
    activity transacted by originating hedged positions with
    wholesale energy marketers, producers, end users, utilities,
    retail aggregators and alternative energy suppliers.
    Substantially all of this activity represents full requirements
    contracts, whereby the hedged percentage is largely based on
    estimated load requirements.

•

Proprietary Trading

— Represents derivative
    activity transacted with the intent of taking a view, capturing
    market price changes, or putting capital at risk. This activity
    is speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an existing
    exposure.

•

Other

— Includes derivative activity associated
    with our Unconventional Gas reserves. A portion of the price
    risk associated with anticipated production from the Barnett
    natural gas reserves has been mitigated through 2010. Changes in
    the value of the hedges are recorded as Derivative assets or
    liabilities, with an offset in Other comprehensive income to the
    extent that the hedges are deemed effective. The amounts shown
    in the following tables exclude the value of the underlying gas
    reserves including changes therein. Other also includes
    derivative activity at Detroit Edison related to FTR’s and
    forward contracts related to emissions. Changes in the value of
    derivative contracts at Detroit Edison are recorded as
    Derivative assets or liabilities, with an offset to Regulatory
    assets or liabilities as the settlement value of these contracts
    will be included in the PSCR mechanism when realized.

A substantial portion of the Company’s price risk related
    to its Antrim shale gas exploration and production business was
    mitigated by financial contracts that hedged our price risk
    exposure through 2013. The contracts were retained when the
    Antrim business was sold and offsetting financial contracts were
    put into place to effectively settle these positions. The
    contracts will require payments through 2013. These contracts
    represent a significant portion of the above net

mark-to-market

liability.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Price Risk

DTE Energy has commodity price risk in both utility and
    non-utility businesses arising from market price fluctuations.

The Electric and Gas utility businesses have risks in
    conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal, natural gas,
    uranium, electricity, and base metals to meet their service
    obligations. However, the Company does not bear significant
    exposure to earnings risk as such changes are included in the
    form of PSCR and GCR regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms. In
    addition, changes in the price of natural gas can impact the
    valuation of lost and stolen gas, storage sales revenue and
    uncollectible expenses at the Gas Utility. Gas Utility manages
    its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily
    through the sale of long-term storage contracts. The Company has
    tracking mechanisms to mitigate a portion of losses related to
    uncollectible accounts receivable at MichCon and Detroit Edison.
    The Company is exposed to short-term cash flow or liquidity risk
    as a result of the time differential between actual cash
    settlements and regulatory rate recovery.

Our Gas Storage and Pipelines business segment has limited
    exposure to natural gas price fluctuations and manages its
    exposure through the sale of long-term storage and
    transportation contracts.

Our Unconventional Gas Production business segment has exposure
    to natural gas and, to a lesser extent, crude oil price
    fluctuations. These commodity price fluctuations can impact both
    current year earnings and reserve valuations. To manage this
    exposure we may use forward energy and futures contracts.

Our Power and Industrial Projects business segment is subject to
    electricity, natural gas, coal and coal-based product price risk
    and other risks associated with the weakened U.S. economy.
    To the extent that



commodity price risk has not been mitigated through the use of
    long-term contracts, we manage this exposure using forward
    energy, capacity and futures contracts.

Our Energy Trading business segment has exposure to electricity,
    natural gas, crude oil, heating oil, and foreign exchange price
    fluctuations. These risks are managed by our energy marketing
    and trading operations through the use of forward energy,
    capacity, storage, options and futures contracts, within
    pre-determined risk parameters.

Credit
    Risk

Bankruptcies

The Company purchases and sells electricity, gas, coal, coke and
    other energy products from and to numerous companies operating
    in the steel, automotive, energy, retail, financial and other
    industries. Certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy
    protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
    Code. The Company regularly reviews contingent matters relating
    to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and
    records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable
    loss. The Company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for
    probable loss. The final resolution of these matters may have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s utilities and certain non-utility businesses
    provide services to the domestic automotive industry, including
    GM, Ford Motor Company (Ford) and Chrysler and many of their
    vendors and suppliers. Chrysler filed for bankruptcy protection
    on April 30, 2009. We have reserved approximately
    $9 million of pre-petition accounts receivable related to
    Chrysler as of December 31, 2009. GM filed for bankruptcy
    protection on June 1, 2009. We have reserved or written off
    approximately $5 million of pre-petition accounts and notes
    receivable related to GM as of December 31, 2009. Closing
    of GM or Chrysler plants or other facilities that operate within
    Detroit Edison’s service territory will also negatively
    impact the Company’s operating revenues in future periods.
    In 2009, GM and Chrysler each represented two percent of our
    annual electric sales volumes, respectively. GM and Chrysler
    have an immaterial impact to MichCon’s revenues.

Other

We engage in business with customers that are non-investment
    grade. We closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers
    and, when deemed necessary, we request collateral or guarantees
    from such customers to secure their obligations.

Trading
    Activities

We are exposed to credit risk through trading activities. Credit
    risk is the potential loss that may result if our trading
    counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations. We
    utilize both external and internally



generated credit assessments when determining the credit quality
    of our trading counterparties. The following table displays the
    credit quality of our trading counterparties as of
    December 31, 2009:

Interest
    Rate Risk

DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with
    the issuance of debt and preferred securities. In order to
    manage interest costs, we may use treasury locks and interest
    rate swap agreements. Our exposure to interest rate risk arises
    primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial
    paper rates and London Inter-Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). As of
    December 31, 2009, we had a floating rate

debt-to-total

debt ratio of approximately five percent (excluding securitized
    debt).

Foreign
    Exchange Risk

The Company has foreign exchange risk arising from market price
    fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts. These
    contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily
    for the purchase and sale of power as well as for long-term
    transportation capacity. To limit our exposure to foreign
    exchange fluctuations, we have entered into a series of exchange
    forward contracts through January 2013. Additionally, we may
    enter into fair value exchange hedges to mitigate changes in the
    value of contracts or loans.

Summary
    of Sensitivity Analysis

The Company performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values
    of our commodity contracts, long-term debt obligations and
    foreign exchange forward contracts. The commodity contracts and
    foreign exchange risk



listed below principally relate to our energy marketing and
    trading activities. The sensitivity analysis involved increasing
    and decreasing forward rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008
    by a hypothetical 10% and calculating the resulting change in
    the fair values.

The results of the sensitivity analysis calculations as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008:

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of disclosure controls and procedures

Management of the Company carried out an evaluation, under the
    supervision and with the participation of DTE Energy’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e))

as of December 31, 2009, which is the end of the period
    covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures are
    effective in providing reasonable assurance that information
    required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files
    or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
    include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
    provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
    disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
    under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the inherent
    limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and
    procedures, management cannot provide absolute assurance that
    the objectives of its disclosure controls and procedures will be
    attained.

(b)

Management’s
    report on internal control over financial
    reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company has assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on this
    assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31,
    2009, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm who also audited the Company’s
    financial statements, as stated in their report which appears
    herein.

(c)

Changes
    in internal control over financial reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

DTE Energy Company:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of DTE Energy Company and its
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
    financial statement schedule for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 listed in the accompanying index presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
    financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audit. We conducted our audit in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

DTE Energy Company:

We have audited the consolidated statement of financial position
    of DTE Energy Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
    as of December 31, 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in
    shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income for years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Our audits also included
    the 2008 and 2007 information in the financial statement
    schedules listed in the accompanying index. These financial
    statements and financial statement schedules are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DTE
    Energy Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 2008, and
    the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
    years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also, in our opinion, such 2008 and 2007 financial
    statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements of the Company taken as a
    whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information
    set forth therein.

DTE
    Energy Company

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 —
    ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Corporate
    Structure

DTE Energy owns the following businesses:

•

Detroit Edison, an electric utility engaged in the generation,
    purchase, distribution and sale of electric energy to
    approximately 2.1 million customers in southeast Michigan;

•

MichCon, a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase, storage,
    transmission, distribution and sale of natural gas to
    approximately 1.2 million customers throughout
    Michigan; and

•

Other segments are involved in 1) natural gas pipelines and
    storage; 2) unconventional gas project development and
    production; 3) power and industrial projects and coal
    transportation and marketing; and 4) energy marketing and
    trading operations.

Detroit Edison and MichCon are regulated by the MPSC. The FERC
    regulates certain activities of Detroit Edison’s business
    as well as various other aspects of businesses under DTE Energy.
    In addition, the Company is regulated by other federal and state
    regulatory agencies including the NRC, the EPA and MDEQ.

References in this report to “Company” or
    “DTE” are to DTE Energy and its subsidiaries,
    collectively.

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared
    using accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. These accounting principles require
    management to use estimates and assumptions that impact reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
    may differ from the Company’s estimates.

Certain prior year balances were reclassified to match the
    current year’s financial statement presentation.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The Company consolidates all majority owned subsidiaries and
    investments in entities in which it has controlling influence.
    Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the
    equity method when the Company is able to influence the
    operating policies of the investee. Non-majority owned
    investments include investments in limited liability companies,
    partnerships or joint ventures. When the Company does not
    influence the operating policies of an investee, the cost method
    is used. These consolidated financial statements also reflect
    the Company’s proportionate interests in certain jointly
    owned utility plant. The Company eliminates all intercompany
    balances and transactions.

We consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) for which we
    are the primary beneficiary. In general, we determine whether we
    are the primary beneficiary of a VIE through a qualitative
    analysis of risk which indentifies which variable interest
    holder absorbs the majority of the financial risk or rewards and
    variability of the VIE. In performing this analysis, we consider
    all relevant facts and circumstances, including: the design and
    activities of the VIE, the terms of the contracts the VIE has
    entered into, the identification of variable interest holders
    including equity owners, customers, suppliers and debt holders
    and which parties participated significantly in the design of
    the entity. If the qualitative analysis is inconclusive, a
    specific quantitative analysis is performed. Refer to
    Note 3 for discussion of changes in consolidation guidance
    applicable to VIEs.

Legal entities within the Company’s Power and Industrial
    Projects segments enter into long-term contractual arrangements
    with customers to supply energy-related products or services.
    The entities are designed to pass-through the commodity risk
    associated with these contracts to the customers, with the
    Company retaining operational and customer default risk and
    generally are VIEs. Potential new arrangements



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

are continually under consideration and completed arrangements
    in 2009 have resulted in an increase in the number of VIEs with
    which the Company is affiliated.

The aforementioned arrangements are assessed on a qualitative
    and, if necessary, quantitative basis to determine who is the
    primary beneficiary. If the Company is the primary beneficiary,
    the VIE is consolidated. If the Company is not the primary
    beneficiary, the VIE is accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting. The VIEs are reviewed for reconsideration events
    each quarter, and the assessment of the primary beneficiary
    updated, if necessary.

DTE Energy has interests in various unconsolidated trusts that
    were formed for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities
    and lending the gross proceeds to the Company. The sole assets
    of the trusts are debt securities of DTE Energy with terms
    similar to those of the related preferred securities. Payments
    the Company makes are used by the trusts to make cash
    distributions on the preferred securities it has issued. We have
    reviewed these interests and have determined they are VIEs, but
    the Company is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have
    variable interests in the trusts.

The maximum risk exposure for consolidated VIEs is reflected on
    our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. For
    non-consolidated VIEs, the maximum risk exposure is generally
    only the extent of our investment

and/or

the
    amount which we have guaranteed. In general, creditors of
    consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of
    the Company.

The following table summarizes the amounts for variable interest
    entities with which the Company is affiliated as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008:

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Revenues

Revenues from the sale and delivery of electricity, and the
    sale, delivery and storage of natural gas are recognized as
    services are provided. Detroit Edison and MichCon record
    revenues for electric and gas provided but unbilled at the end
    of each month.

Detroit Edison’s accrued revenues include a component for
    the cost of power sold that is recoverable through the PSCR
    mechanism. MichCon’s accrued revenues include a component
    for the cost of gas sold that is recoverable through the GCR
    mechanism. Annual PSCR and GCR proceedings before the MPSC
    permit Detroit Edison and MichCon to recover prudent and
    reasonable supply costs. Any overcollection or undercollection
    of costs, including interest, will be reflected in future rates.
    See Note 12.

Non-utility businesses recognize revenues as services are
    provided and products are delivered. Revenues and energy costs
    related to trading contracts are presented on a net basis in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Commodity derivatives
    used for trading purposes are accounted for using the

mark-to-market

method with unrealized gains and losses recorded in Operating
    Revenues.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Accounting
    for ISO Transactions

Detroit Edison participates in the energy market through MISO.
    MISO requires that we submit hourly day-ahead, real time and FTR
    bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region.
    Detroit Edison accounts for MISO transactions on a net hourly
    basis in each of the day-ahead, real-time and FTR markets and
    net transactions across all MISO energy market locations. We
    record net purchases in a single hour in fuel, purchased power
    and gas and net sales in a single hour in operating revenues in
    the Consolidated Statements of Income. We record net sale
    billing adjustments when we receive invoices. We record expense
    accruals for future net purchases adjustments base on historical
    experience, and reconcile accruals to actual expenses when we
    receive invoices.

Energy Trading participates in the energy markets through MISO,
    PJM and ISO-NE. These markets require that we submit hourly
    day-ahead, real time bids and offers for energy at locations
    across each RTO region. We submit bids in the annual and monthly
    auction revenue rights and FTR auctions for the all the
    RTO’s. Energy Trading accounts for these transactions on a
    net hourly basis for the day-ahead, real-time and FTR markets.
    These transactions are related to our trading contracts which
    are presented on a net basis in operating revenues in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income is the change in Common shareholders’
    equity during a period from transactions and events from
    non-owner sources, including net income. As shown in the
    following table, amounts recorded to Other comprehensive income
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 include unrealized
    gains and losses from derivatives accounted for as cash flow
    hedges, unrealized gains and losses on available for sale
    securities, and changes in benefit obligations, consisting of
    deferred actuarial losses, prior service costs and transition
    amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefit
    plans, and foreign exchange translation adjustments.

Cash
    Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks
    and temporary investments purchased with remaining maturities of
    three months or less. Restricted cash consists of funds held to
    satisfy requirements of certain debt and partnership operating
    agreements. Restricted cash designated for interest and
    principal payments within one year is classified as a current
    asset.

Receivables

Accounts receivable are primarily composed of trade receivables
    and unbilled revenue. Our accounts receivable are stated at net
    realizable value.

The allowance for doubtful accounts for Detroit Edison and
    MichCon is generally calculated using the aging approach that
    utilizes rates developed in reserve studies. We establish an
    allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses
    and management’s assessment of existing economic
    conditions, customer trends, and other factors. Customer
    accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount
    billed is not



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

received by the due date, typically 21 days, however,
    factors such as assistance programs may delay aggressive action.
    We assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on
    contractual past-due terms established with customers. Customer
    accounts are written off when collection efforts have been
    exhausted, generally one year after service has been terminated.

The customer allowance for doubtful accounts for our other
    businesses is calculated based on specific review of probable
    future collections based on receivable balances in excess of
    90 days.

Unbilled revenues of $618 million and $812 million are
    included in customer accounts receivable at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Inventories

The Company generally values inventory at average cost.

Gas inventory of $44 million and $14 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, at MichCon is
    determined using the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method. At December 31, 2009, the
    replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the LIFO
    cost by $218 million. At December 31, 2008, the
    replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the LIFO
    cost by $232 million. During 2008, MichCon liquidated
    4.2 Bcf prior years’ LIFO layers. The liquidation
    reduced 2008 cost of gas by approximately $21 million, but
    had no impact on earnings as a result of the GCR mechanism.

Property,
    Retirement and Maintenance, and Depreciation, Depletion and
    Amortization

Property is stated at cost and includes construction-related
    labor, materials, overheads and an allowance for funds used
    during construction (AFUDC). The cost of properties retired,
    less salvage value, at Detroit Edison and MichCon is charged to
    accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and
    repairs are charged to expense when incurred, except for Fermi 2.

Approximately $13 million and $25 million of expenses
    related to Fermi 2 refueling outages were accrued at
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.
    Amounts are accrued on a pro-rata basis over an

18-month

period that coincides with scheduled refueling outages at Fermi
    2. This accrual of outage costs matches the regulatory recovery
    of these costs in rates set by the MPSC.

The Company bases depreciation provisions for utility property
    at Detroit Edison and MichCon on straight-line and

units-of-production

rates approved by the MPSC.

Non-utility property is depreciated over its estimated useful
    life using straight-line, declining-balance or

units-of-production

methods.

The Company credits depreciation, depletion and amortization
    expense when it establishes regulatory assets for plant-related
    costs such as depreciation or plant-related financing costs. The
    Company charges depreciation, depletion and amortization expense
    when it amortizes these regulatory assets. The Company credits
    interest expense to reflect the accretion income on certain
    regulatory assets.

Capitalized software costs are classified as Property, plant and
    equipment and the related amortization is included in
    Accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization on the
    Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company
    capitalizes the costs associated with computer software it
    develops or obtains for use in its business. The Company
    amortizes capitalized software costs on a straight-line basis
    over the expected period of benefit, ranging from 3 to
    20 years. See Note 7.

Unconventional
    Gas Production

The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting
    for investments in gas properties. Under this method of
    accounting, all property acquisition costs and costs of
    exploratory and development



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of
    whether the well contains proved reserves. If an exploratory
    well does not contain proved reserves, the costs of drilling the
    well are expensed. The costs of development wells are
    capitalized, whether productive or nonproductive. Geological and
    geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of
    carrying and retaining properties without economical quantities
    of proved reserves are expensed as incurred. An impairment loss
    is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved gas
    properties exceed the aggregate related undiscounted future net
    revenues. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that
    capitalized costs of unproved properties, on a

property-by-property

basis, are considered not to be realizable. Depreciation,
    depletion and amortization of proved gas properties are
    determined using the

units-of-production

method.

Long-Lived
    Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an
    asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the
    asset exceeds the expected future cash flows generated by the
    asset, an impairment loss is recognized resulting in the asset
    being written down to its estimated fair value. Assets to be
    disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
    fair value, less costs to sell.

Our Power and Industrial Projects segment has long-term
    contracts with General Motors Corporation (GM) to provide onsite
    energy services at certain of their facilities. At
    December 31, 2009, the book value of long-lived assets used
    in the servicing of these facilities was approximately
    $65 million. In addition, we have an equity investment of
    approximately $51 million in an entity which provides
    similar services to Chrysler LLC (Chrysler). We considered the
    2009 bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler as an indication of
    possible impairment due to a significant adverse change in the
    business climate that could affect the value of our long-lived
    assets, performed impairment tests on these assets in the second
    quarter of 2009 and determined that we did not have an
    impairment. We have also determined that we do not have an other
    than temporary decline in our Chrysler-related equity
    investment. We will continue to assess these matters in future
    periods for possible asset impairments. See Note 11.

Intangible
    Assets

The Company has certain intangible assets relating to emission
    allowances and non-utility contracts. Emission allowances are
    charged to fuel expense as the allowances are consumed in the
    operation of the business. Our intangible assets related to
    emission allowances were $9 million at December 31,
    2009 and $19 million at December 31, 2008. The gross
    carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible
    assets at December 31, 2009 were $64 million and
    $19 million, respectively. The gross carrying amount and
    accumulated amortization of intangible assets at
    December 31, 2008 were $66 million and
    $15 million, respectively. The Company amortizes contract
    intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the expected
    period of benefit, ranging from 4 to 30 years. Intangible
    assets amortization expense was $4 million in 2009,
    $7 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007.
    Amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to be
    $4 million annually for 2010 through 2014.

Excise
    and Sales Taxes

The Company records the billing of excise and sales taxes as a
    receivable with an offsetting payable to the applicable taxing
    authority, with no impact on the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Deferred
    Debt Costs

The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred
    and amortized over the life of each debt issue. In accordance
    with MPSC regulations applicable to the Company’s electric
    and gas utilities, the unamortized discount, premium and expense
    related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized over



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the life of the replacement issue. Discount, premium and expense
    on early redemptions of debt associated with non-utility
    operations are charged to earnings.

Investments
    in Debt and Equity Securities

The Company generally classifies investments in debt and equity
    securities as either trading or

available-for-sale

and has recorded such investments at market value with
    unrealized gains or losses included in earnings or in other
    comprehensive income or loss, respectively. Changes in the fair
    value of Fermi 2 nuclear decommissioning investments are
    recorded as adjustments to regulatory assets or liabilities, due
    to a recovery mechanism from customers. The Company’s
    investments are reviewed for impairment each reporting period.
    If the assessment indicates that the impairment is other than
    temporary, a loss is recognized resulting in the investment
    being written down to its estimated fair value. See Note 4.

Offsetting
    Amounts Related to Certain Contracts

The Company offsets the fair value of derivative instruments
    with cash collateral received or paid for those derivative
    instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master
    netting agreement, which reduces both the Company’s total
    assets and total liabilities. As of December 31, 2009 and
    December 31, 2008, the total cash collateral posted, net of
    cash collateral received, was $117 million and
    $30 million, respectively. Derivative assets and derivative
    liabilities are shown net of collateral of $34 million and
    $120 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009
    and $31 million and $17 million, respectively as of
    December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, amounts of
    cash collateral received or paid not related to unrealized
    derivative positions totaling $32 million and
    $1 million were included in Accounts receivable and
    Accounts payable, respectively. At December 31, 2008,
    amounts of cash collateral received or paid not related to
    unrealized derivative positions totaling $7 million and
    $23 million were included in Accounts receivable and
    Accounts payable, respectively.

    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

FASB
    Accounting Standards
    Codification

tm

(Codification)

On July 1, 2009, the Codification became the single source
    of authoritative nongovernmental generally accepted accounting
    principles (GAAP) in the United States of America. The
    Codification is a reorganization of current GAAP into a topical
    format that eliminates the current GAAP hierarchy and
    establishes two levels of guidance — authoritative and
    non-authoritative. According to the FASB, all
    “non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature”
    that is not included in the Codification would be considered
    non-authoritative. The FASB has indicated that the Codification
    does not change current GAAP. Instead, the proposed changes aim
    to (1) reduce the time and effort it takes for users to
    research accounting questions and (2) improve the usability
    of current accounting standards. The Codification is effective
    for interim and annual periods ending after September 15,
    2009.

Fair
    Value Accounting

In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC 820
    (SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements)

. The
    standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
    principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. It emphasizes that fair value is a market-based
    measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Fair value
    measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that
    market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
    Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820
    (SFAS No. 157). The cumulative effect adjustment upon
    adoption of ASC 820 represented a $4 million increase to
    the January 1, 2008 balance of retained earnings. As
    permitted by ASC

820-10

(FSP

No. 157-2),

the Company elected to defer the effective date of the standard
    as it pertains to measurement and disclosures about the fair
    value of non-financial assets and liabilities made on a
    nonrecurring basis. The Company has adopted the recognition
    provisions for non-financial assets and liabilities as of
    January 1, 2009. See Note 4.

In April 2009, the FASB issued three FSPs intended to provide
    additional application guidance and enhance disclosures
    regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities.
    The FSPs are effective for interim and annual periods ending
    after June 15, 2009.

which applies
    to all assets and liabilities, i.e., financial and nonfinancial,
    reemphasizes that the objective of fair value remains unchanged
    (i.e., an exit price notion). The FSP provides application
    guidance on measuring fair value when the volume and level of
    activity has significantly decreased and identifying
    transactions that are not orderly. The FSP also emphasizes that
    an entity cannot presume that an observable transaction price is

Determining
    Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions
    Are Participating Securities

In June 2008, the FASB issued ASC

260-10

(FSP
    EITF

No. 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions are Participating Securities).

This FSP
    addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment
    transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and,
    therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in
    computing earnings per share (EPS) under the two-class method
    described in ASC

260-10,

section 45, paragraphs 59A and 60B
    (SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per Share).

Unvested
    share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights
    to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid)
    are participating securities and shall be included in the
    computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. Stock
    awards granted by the Company under its stock-based compensation
    plan qualify as a participating security. This FSP was effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim
    periods beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company
    adopted the requirements of the FSP effective January 1,
    2009 and applied the requirements retrospectively. The adoption
    of the FSP had the effect of reducing previously reported 2008
    amounts for basic and diluted earnings per common share by $.03
    and $.02, respectively, and reducing previously reported 2007
    amounts for basic and diluted earnings per common share by $.03
    and $.01, respectively.

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC

810-10

(SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an Amendment of
    ARB No. 51).

This standard establishes accounting and
    reporting standards for the noncontrolling interests in a
    subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It
    clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an
    ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be
    reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. The
    standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
    within those years, beginning on or after December 15,
    2008. This standard shall be applied prospectively as of the
    beginning of the fiscal year in which this standard is initially
    applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements
    which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods
    presented. The Company adopted the standard as of
    January 1, 2009 and applied the new presentation and
    disclosure requirements retrospectively. As a result, the
    formats and captions of certain 2008 and 2007 financial
    statement amounts have been revised to present noncontrolling
    interests in accordance with ASC

810-10

(SFAS No. 160). These revisions include reclassifying
    minority interest expense as net income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests, moving minority interest to
    noncontrolling interests in total shareholders’ equity, and
    separately reflecting activity of noncontrolling interests in
    the Consolidated Statements of Equity and of Comprehensive
    Income.

Disclosures
    about Derivative Instruments and Guarantees

In March 2008, the FASB issued ASC

815-10

(SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of
    FASB Statement No. 133)

. This standard requires
    enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and
    hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of
    financial reporting. Entities are required to provide enhanced
    disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under ASC 815
    (SFAS No. 133) and its related interpretations,
    and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    affect an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance, and cash flows.

The standard is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
    November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged.
    Comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption
    are encouraged but not required. The Company adopted the
    standard effective January 1, 2009. See Note 5.

Subsequent
    Events

In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855 (SFAS No. 165,

Subsequent Events)

. This standard provides guidance on
    management’s assessment of subsequent events. The new
    standard clarifies that management must evaluate, as of each
    reporting period, events or transactions that occur after the
    balance sheet date “through the date that the financial
    statements are issued or are available to be issued.”
    Management must perform its assessment for both interim and
    annual financial reporting periods. The standard does not
    significantly change the Company’s practice for evaluating
    such events. ASC 855 (SFAS No. 165) is effective
    prospectively for interim and annual periods ending after
    June 15, 2009 and requires disclosure of the date
    subsequent events are evaluated through. The Company adopted the
    standard during the quarter ended June 30, 2009. See
    Note 2.

Transfers
    of Financial Assets

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU

2009-16

(SFAS No. 166,

Accounting for Transfers of
    Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB No. 140).

This standard amends ASC 860, (SFAS No. 140),
    eliminates the concept of a “qualifying special-purpose
    entity” (QSPE) and associated guidance and creates more
    stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a
    financial asset as a sale. ASU

2009-16

(SFAS No. 166) is intended to enhance reporting
    in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis and the
    deterioration in the global credit markets. The standard is
    effective for financial asset transfers occurring after the
    beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins
    after November 15, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. ASU

2009-16

(SFAS No. 166) must be applied prospectively to
    transfers of financial assets occurring on or after its
    effective date. The adoption of ASU

2009-16

(SFAS No. 166) will not have a material impact on
    DTE Energy’s consolidated financial statements.

Variable
    Interest Entities (VIE)

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU

2009-17

(SFAS No. 167,

Amendments to FASB Interpretation
    46(R)).

This standard amends the consolidation guidance that
    applies to VIEs and affects the overall consolidation analysis
    under ASC 810 -10 (Interpretation 46(R)). The amendments to the
    consolidation guidance affect all entities and enterprises
    currently within the scope of ASC

810-10,

as
    well as qualifying special purpose entities that are currently
    outside the scope of ASC

810-10.

Accordingly, the Company will need to reconsider its previous
    ASC

810-10

conclusions, including (1) whether an entity is a VIE,
    (2) whether the enterprise is the VIE’s primary
    beneficiary, and (3) what type of financial statement
    disclosures are required. ASU

2009-17

(SFAS No. 167) is effective as of the beginning
    of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2009. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently
    assessing the impact of ASU

2009-17

(SFAS No. 167), however adoption of the standard is
    not expected to have a material impact to the consolidated
    financial statements.

Fair
    Value Measurements and Disclosures

In September and August 2009, respectively, the FASB issued ASU

2009-12,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure,

and ASU

2009-05,

Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value.

ASU

2009-12

provides guidance for the fair value measurement of investments
    in certain entities that calculate the net asset value per share
    (or its equivalent) determined as of the reporting entity’s
    measurement date. Certain attributes of the investment (such as
    restrictions on redemption) and transaction prices from

principal-to-principal

or brokered transactions will not be considered in measuring the
    fair value of the investment. The amendments in this standard
    are effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    December 15, 2009.

ASU

2009-05

provides guidance on measuring the fair value of liabilities
    under ASC 820. This standard clarifies that in the absence of a
    quoted price in an active market for an identical liability at
    the measurement date, companies may apply approaches that use
    the quoted price of an investment in the identical liability or



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

similar liabilities traded as assets or other valuation
    techniques consistent with the fair-value measurement principles
    in ASC 820. The standard permits fair value measurements of
    liabilities that are based on the price that a company would pay
    to transfer the liability to a new obligor. It also permits a
    company to measure the fair value of liabilities using an
    estimate of the price it would receive to enter into the
    liability at that date. The new standard is effective for
    interim and annual periods beginning after August 27, 2009
    and applies to all fair-value measurements of liabilities
    required by GAAP. The adoption of ASU

2009-12

and
    ASU

2009-05

did not have a material impact on DTE Energy’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-06,

Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements

. ASU

2010-06

requires the gross presentation of activity within the
    Level 3 fair value measurement roll forward and details of
    transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value
    measurements. The new disclosures are required of all entities
    that are required to provide disclosures about recurring and
    nonrecurring fair value measurements. ASU

2010-06

is
    effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
    after December 15, 2009, except for the gross presentation
    of the Level 3 fair value measurement roll forward which is
    effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
    December 15, 2010 and for interim reporting periods within
    those years.

Revenue
    Arrangements

In September 2009, the FASB ratified Issue

No. 08-1,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (not yet
    codified).

Issue

08-1

provides principles and application guidance on whether multiple
    deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be separated, and
    the consideration allocated. This standard shall be applied
    prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010, with earlier application permitted.
    Alternatively, an entity may elect to adopt this standard on a
    retrospective basis. The Company is currently assessing the
    impact of Issue

No. 08-1

on DTE Energy’s consolidated financial statements. Adoption
    of the standard is not expected to have a material impact to the
    consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 4 —
    FAIR VALUE

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date
    in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a
    market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs,
    which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use
    in pricing assets or liabilities. These inputs can be readily
    observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable
    inputs. The Company makes certain assumptions it believes that
    market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities,
    including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the
    inputs to valuation techniques. Credit risk of the Company and
    its counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets
    and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact
    of which is immaterial for the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008. The Company believes it uses valuation techniques
    that maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and
    minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

A fair value hierarchy has been established, which prioritizes
    the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in
    three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
    priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the
    lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). In some
    cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in
    different levels of the fair value hierarchy. All assets and
    liabilities are required to be classified in their entirety
    based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
    fair value measurement in its entirety. Assessing the
    significance of a particular input may require judgment
    considering factors specific to the asset or liability,



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and its
    placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company
    classifies fair value balances based on the fair value hierarchy
    defined as follows:

•

Level 1

— Consists of unadjusted quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting
    date.

•

Level 2

— Consists of inputs other than
    quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly
    observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable
    through corroboration with observable market data.

•

Level 3

— Consists of unobservable inputs
    for assets or liabilities whose fair value is estimated based on
    internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that
    are generally less readily observable and supported by little,
    if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable
    inputs are developed based on the best available information and
    subject to cost-benefit constraints.

Transfers in/out of Level 3 represent existing assets or
    liabilities that were either previously categorized as a higher
    level and for which the inputs to the model become unobservable
    or assets and liabilities that were previously classified as
    Level 3 for which the lowest significant input became
    observable during the period. Transfers in/out of Level 3
    are reflected as if they had occurred at the beginning of the
    period. Transfers out of Level 3 in 2009 reflect a change
    in the significance of unobservable inputs and an increased
    reliance on broker quotes for certain gas transactions.

Cash
    Equivalents

Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three
    months or less when purchased. The cash equivalents shown in the
    fair value table are comprised of investments in money market
    funds. The fair values of the shares of these funds are based on
    observable market prices and, therefore, have been categorized
    as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Trusts and Other Investments

The nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments have been
    established to satisfy Detroit Edison’s nuclear
    decommissioning obligations. The nuclear decommissioning trusts
    and other fund investments hold debt and equity securities
    directly and indirectly through commingled funds and
    institutional mutual funds. Exchange-traded debt and equity
    securities held directly are valued using quoted market prices
    in actively traded markets. The commingled funds and
    institutional mutual funds which hold exchange-traded equity or
    debt securities are valued based on the underlying securities,
    using quoted prices in actively traded markets.
    Non-exchange-traded fixed income securities are valued based
    upon quotations available from brokers or pricing services. For
    non-exchange traded fixed income securities, the trustees
    receive prices from pricing services. A primary price source is
    identified by asset type, class or issue for each security. The
    trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use
    a supplemental price source or change the primary price source
    of a given security if the trustees challenge an assigned price
    and determine that another price source is considered to be
    preferable. DTE Energy has obtained an understanding of how
    these prices are derived, including the nature and observability
    of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, DTE
    Energy selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by
    comparison of market-based price sources.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Derivative
    Assets and Liabilities

Derivative assets and liabilities are comprised of physical and
    financial derivative contracts, including futures, forwards,
    options and swaps that are both exchange-traded and

over-the-counter

traded contracts. Various inputs are used to value derivatives
    depending on the type of contract and availability of market
    data. Exchange-traded derivative contracts are valued using
    quoted prices in active markets. DTE Energy considers the
    following criteria in determining whether a market is considered
    active: frequency in which pricing information is updated,
    variability in pricing between sources or over time and the
    availability of public information. Other derivative contracts
    are valued based upon a variety of inputs including commodity
    market prices, broker quotes, interest rates, credit ratings,
    default rates, market-based seasonality and basis differential
    factors. DTE Energy monitors the prices that are supplied by
    brokers and pricing services and may use a supplemental price
    source or change the primary price source of an index if prices
    become unavailable or another price source is determined to be
    more representative of fair value. DTE Energy has obtained an
    understanding of how these prices are derived. Additionally, DTE
    Energy selectively corroborates the fair value of its
    transactions by comparison of market-based price sources.
    Mathematical valuation models are used for derivatives for which
    external market data is not readily observable, such as
    contracts which extend beyond the actively traded reporting
    period.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using quoted
    market prices when available and a discounted cash flow analysis
    based upon estimated current borrowing rates when quoted market
    prices are not available. The table below shows the fair value
    relative to the carrying value for long-term debt securities.
    Certain other financial instruments, such as notes payable,
    customer deposits and notes receivable are not shown as carrying
    value approximates fair value. See Note 5 for further fair
    value information on financial and derivative instruments.

Nuclear
    Decommissioning Trust Funds

Detroit Edison has a legal obligation to decommission its
    nuclear power plants following the expiration of their operating
    licenses. This obligation is reflected as an asset retirement
    obligation on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
    See Note 9 for additional information.

The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear
    power plants and requires decommissioning funding based upon a
    formula. The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of
    decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of
    external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi 2.
    Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of
    decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level
    radioactive waste. Detroit Edison is continuing to
    fund FERC jurisdictional amounts for decommissioning even
    though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates. The
    Company believes the MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate
    to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning using the NRC
    formula. The decommissioning assets, anticipated earnings
    thereon and future revenues from decommissioning collections
    will be used to decommission Fermi 2. The Company expects the
    liabilities to be reduced to zero at the conclusion of the
    decommissioning activities. If amounts remain in the trust funds
    for Fermi 2 following the completion of the decommissioning
    activities, those amounts will be disbursed based on rulings by
    the MPSC and FERC.

The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by Detroit Edison.
    Contributions to the Fermi 1 trust are discretionary.

    investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds consisted
    of approximately 42% in publicly traded equity securities, 57%
    in fixed debt instruments and 1% in cash equivalents. The debt
    securities at both December 31, 2009 and December 31,
    2008 had an average maturity of approximately 5 years.

As Detroit Edison does not have the ability to hold impaired
    investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for the
    anticipated recovery of market value, all unrealized losses are
    considered to be other than temporary impairments.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Impairment charges for unrealized losses incurred by the Fermi 2
    trust are recognized as a regulatory asset. Detroit Edison
    recognized $48 million and $92 million of unrealized
    losses as regulatory assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Since the decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by
    Detroit Edison rather than through a regulatory recovery
    mechanism, there is no corresponding regulatory asset treatment.
    Therefore, impairment charges for unrealized losses incurred by
    the Fermi 1 trust are recognized in earnings immediately. There
    were no impairment charges in 2009 and 2008 for Fermi 1. Detroit
    Edison recognized impairment charges of $0.2 million for
    Fermi 1 in 2007.

NOTE 5 —
    FINANCIAL AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Company recognizes all derivatives on the Consolidated
    Statements of Financial Position at their fair value unless they
    qualify for certain scope exceptions, including the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception. Further, derivatives that
    qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified
    as either hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability
    of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized
    asset or liability (cash flow hedge), or as hedges of the fair
    value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized
    firm commitment (fair value hedge). For cash flow hedges, the
    portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in
    offsetting the change in the value of the underlying exposure is
    deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income and later
    reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction
    occurs. For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for the
    derivative are recognized in earnings each period. Gains and
    losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized
    in earnings immediately. For derivatives that do not qualify or
    are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in the fair
    value are recognized in earnings each period.

The Company’s primary market risk exposure is associated
    with commodity prices, credit, interest rates and foreign
    exchange. The Company has risk management policies to monitor
    and manage market risks. The Company uses derivative instruments
    to manage some of the exposure. The Company uses derivative
    instruments for trading purposes in its Energy Trading segment
    and the coal marketing activities of its Power and Industrial
    Projects segment. Contracts classified as derivative instruments
    include power, gas, oil and certain coal forwards, futures,
    options and swaps, and foreign exchange contracts. Items not
    classified as derivatives include proprietary gas inventory, gas
    storage and transportation arrangements, and gas and oil
    reserves. Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and
    shown as Derivative assets or liabilities on the Consolidated
    Statements of Financial Position.

Electric Utility

— Detroit Edison generates,
    purchases, distributes and sells electricity. Detroit Edison
    uses forward energy and capacity contracts to manage changes in
    the price of electricity and fuel. Substantially all



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

of these contracts meet the normal purchases and sales exemption
    and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method. Other
    derivative contracts are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism
    when settled. This results in the deferral of unrealized gains
    and losses as Regulatory assets or liabilities, until realized.

Gas Utility

— MichCon purchases, stores,
    transports and distributes natural gas and sells storage and
    transportation capacity. MichCon has fixed-priced contracts for
    portions of its expected gas supply requirements through 2013.
    These gas-supply contracts are designated and qualify for the
    normal purchases and sales exemption and are therefore accounted
    for under the accrual method. MichCon may also sell forward
    storage and transportation capacity contracts. Forward
    transportation and storage contracts are not derivatives and are
    therefore accounted for under the accrual method.

Gas Storage and Pipelines —

This segment is
    primarily engaged in services related to the transportation and
    storage of natural gas. Fixed-priced contracts are used in the
    marketing and management of transportation and storage services.
    Generally these contracts are not derivatives and are therefore
    accounted for under the accrual method.

Unconventional Gas Production

— The
    Unconventional Gas Production business is engaged in
    unconventional gas project development and production. The
    Company uses derivative contracts to manage changes in the price
    of natural gas. These derivatives are designated as cash flow
    hedges. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive
    income will be reclassified to earnings as the related
    production affects earnings through 2010. In 2008 and 2007,
    $0.5 million of after-tax gains and $222 million of
    after-tax losses, respectively, were reclassified to earnings.
    The 2007 amounts principally related to the sale of the Antrim
    business. Management estimates reclassifying an after-tax gain
    of approximately $1 million to earnings within the next
    twelve months.

Power and Industrial Projects

— Business units
    within this segment manage and operate onsite energy and
    pulverized coal projects, coke batteries, landfill gas recovery
    and power generation assets. These businesses utilize
    fixed-priced contracts in the marketing and management of their
    assets. These contracts are generally not derivatives and are
    therefore accounted for under the accrual method. The segment
    also engages in coal marketing which includes the marketing and
    trading of physical coal and coal financial instruments, and
    forward contracts for the purchase and sale of emissions
    allowances. Certain of these physical and financial coal
    contracts and contracts for the purchase and sale of emission
    allowances are derivatives and are accounted for by recording
    changes in fair value to earnings.

Energy Trading — Commodity Price Risk —

Energy Trading markets and trades wholesale electricity and
    natural gas physical products and energy financial instruments,
    and provides risk management services utilizing energy commodity
    derivative instruments. Forwards, futures, options and swap
    agreements are used to manage exposure to the risk of market
    price and volume fluctuations in its operations. These
    derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value
    to earnings unless certain hedge accounting criteria are met.

Energy Trading — Foreign Exchange Risk —

Energy Trading has foreign exchange forward contracts to
    economically hedge fixed Canadian dollar commitments existing
    under power purchase and sale contracts and gas transportation
    contracts. The Company enters into these contracts to mitigate
    price volatility with respect to fluctuations of the Canadian
    dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. These derivatives are
    accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings
    unless certain hedge accounting criteria are met. In 2008 and
    2007, $1 million and $7 million, respectively, of
    after-tax losses related to a foreign exchange hedge were
    reclassified to earnings. The foreign exchange hedge was fully
    realized as of December 31, 2008 and therefore, no further
    earnings impact is expected.

Corporate and Other — Interest Rate
    Risk —

The Company uses interest rate swaps,
    treasury locks and other derivatives to hedge the risk
    associated with interest rate market volatility. In 2004 and
    2000, the Company entered into a series of interest rate
    derivatives to limit its sensitivity to market interest rate
    risk associated with the issuance of long-term debt. Such
    instruments were designated as cash flow hedges. The



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Company subsequently issued long-term debt and terminated these
    hedges at a cost that is included in other comprehensive loss.
    Amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss will be
    reclassified to interest expense through 2033. In 2010, the
    Company estimates reclassifying $3 million of losses to
    earnings.

Credit Risk —

The utility and non-utility
    businesses are exposed to credit risk if customers or
    counterparties do not comply with their contractual obligations.
    The Company maintains credit policies that significantly
    minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an
    evaluation of potential customers’ and counterparties’
    financial condition, credit rating, collateral requirements or
    other credit enhancements such as letters of credit or
    guarantees. The Company generally uses standardized agreements
    that allow the netting of positive and negative transactions
    associated with a single counterparty. The Company maintains a
    provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the
    credit risk of its customers, historical trends, and other
    information. Based on the Company’s credit policies and its
    December 31, 2009 provision for credit losses, the
    Company’s exposure to counterparty nonperformance is not
    expected to result in material effects on the Company’s
    financial statements.

Derivative
    Activities

The Company manages its MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon
    the delivery period of its contracts and the individual
    components of the risks within each contract. Accordingly, it
    records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations
    under its contracts in separate components based on the
    commodity (e.g. electricity or gas), the product (e.g.
    electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the
    delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g.
    forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and
    year). The following describe the four categories of activities
    represented by their operating characteristics and key risks:

•

Economic Hedges

— Represents derivative
    activity associated with assets owned and contracted by DTE
    Energy, including forward sales of gas production and trades
    associated with owned transportation and storage capacity.
    Changes in the value of derivatives in this category
    economically offset changes in the value of underlying
    non-derivative positions, which do not qualify for fair value
    accounting. The difference in accounting treatment of
    derivatives in this category and the underlying non-derivative
    positions can result in significant earnings volatility.

•

Structured Contracts

— Represents derivative
    activity transacted by originating substantially hedged
    positions with wholesale energy marketers, producers, end users,
    utilities, retail aggregators and alternative energy suppliers.

•

Proprietary Trading

— Represents derivative
    activity transacted with the intent of taking a view, capturing
    market price changes, or putting capital at risk. This activity
    is speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an existing
    exposure.

•

Other

— Includes derivative activity associated
    with our Unconventional Gas reserves. A portion of the price
    risk associated with anticipated production from the Barnett
    natural gas reserves has been mitigated through 2010. Changes in
    the value of the hedges are recorded as Derivative assets or
    liabilities, with an offset in Other comprehensive income to the
    extent that the hedges are deemed effective. The amounts shown
    in the following tables exclude the value of the underlying gas
    reserves including changes therein. Other also includes
    derivative activity at Detroit Edison related to FTRs and
    forward contracts related to emissions. Changes in the value of
    derivative contracts at Detroit Edison are recorded as
    Derivative assets or liabilities, with an offset to Regulatory
    assets or liabilities as the settlement value of these contracts
    will be included in the PSCR mechanism when realized.

Various non-utility subsidiaries of the Company have entered
    into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed
    by DTE Energy. These contracts contain provisions which allow
    the counterparties to request that the Company post cash or
    letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE
    Energy’s credit rating is downgraded below investment
    grade. Certain of these provisions (known as “hard
    triggers”) state specific circumstances under which the
    Company can be asked to post collateral upon the occurrence of a
    credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as “soft
    triggers”) are not as specific. For contracts with soft
    triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral
    which may be requested by counterparties

and/or

which
    the Company may ultimately be required to post. The amount of
    such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on
    commodity prices (primarily gas, power and coal) and the
    provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions. As of
    December 31, 2009, the value of the transactions for which
    the Company would have been exposed to collateral requests had
    DTE Energy’s credit rating been below investment grade on
    such date under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions
    was approximately $250 million. In circumstances where an
    entity is downgraded below investment grade and collateral
    requests



DTE

    Statements — (Continued)

are made as a result, the requesting parties often agree to
    accept less than the full amount of their exposure to the
    downgraded entity.

NOTE 6 —
    GOODWILL

The Company has goodwill resulting from purchase business
    combinations.

In the period from October 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009,
    DTE Energy’s stock price declined 31 percent and at
    March 31, 2009 was approximately 26 percent below its
    book value per share of $37.29. We deemed the duration and
    severity of the decline in DTE Energy’s stock price to be a
    triggering event to test for potential goodwill impairment for
    the first quarter. In performing Step 1 of the impairment test,
    we compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying
    value including goodwill. All reporting units passed Step 1 of
    the impairment test.

For the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and September 30,
    2009, DTE Energy’s closing stock price increased
    16 percent and 27 percent, respectively, as compared
    to the closing stock price at March 31, 2009. Although DTE
    Energy was still trading at a discount to book value at the end
    of the third quarter, the discount improved to 7 percent at
    September 30, 2009 from 26 percent at March 31,
    2009. In assessing whether the continuing discount to book value
    was an indication of impairment, we considered the following
    factors: (1) the severity of the decline in DTE
    Energy’s share price experienced since the fourth quarter
    of 2008 had diminished and was continuing to recover; and
    (2) the assumptions incorporated in the first quarter
    impairment test had either improved or had not changed
    significantly during the second and third quarters such that
    they would change the results of Step 1. As a result of this
    assessment, we determined that the continuing discount to book
    value was not a triggering event for impairment testing purposes
    for the second and third quarters.

We did, however, identify a goodwill impairment test trigger for
    our Energy Services reporting unit related to the long-lived
    asset impairment tests that were performed during the second
    quarter of 2009 on certain automotive-related project companies.
    Accordingly, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test
    for Energy Services as of June 30, 2009. The fair value of
    the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value including
    goodwill. Therefore, the reporting unit passed Step 1 of the
    impairment test. No new trigger was identified during the third
    quarter of 2009.

We performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of
    October 1, 2009 and determined that the estimated fair
    value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no
    impairment existed. We performed our valuations in accordance
    with the requirements for measuring nonrecurring, nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities.

DTE Energy’s stock price continued to improve during the
    fourth quarter, and as of December 31, 2009, it closed in
    excess of its book value per share of $38.03 by 15 percent.
    No triggering events for impairment testing purposes were
    identified during the fourth quarter of 2009.

NOTE 9 —
    ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

The Company has a legal retirement obligation for the
    decommissioning costs for its Fermi 1 and Fermi 2 nuclear
    plants. To a lesser extent, the Company has legal retirement
    obligations for gas production facilities, gas gathering
    facilities and various other operations. The Company has
    conditional retirement obligations for gas pipeline retirement
    costs and disposal of asbestos at certain of its power plants.
    To a lesser extent, the Company has conditional retirement
    obligations at certain service centers, compressor and gate
    stations, and disposal costs for PCB contained within
    transformers and circuit breakers. The Company recognizes such
    obligations as liabilities at fair market value when they are
    incurred, which generally is at the time the associated assets
    are placed in service. Fair value is measured using expected
    future cash outflows discounted

at our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. In its regulated
    operations, the Company defers timing differences that arise in
    the expense recognition of legal asset retirement costs that are
    currently recovered in rates.

No liability has been recorded with respect to lead-based paint,
    as the quantities of lead-based paint in the Company’s
    facilities are unknown. In addition, there is no incremental
    cost to demolitions of lead-based paint facilities vs.
    non-lead-based paint facilities and no regulations currently
    exist requiring any type of special disposal of items containing
    lead-based paint.

The Ludington Hydroelectric Power Plant (a jointly owned plant)
    has an indeterminate life and no legal obligation currently
    exists to decommission the plant at some future date.
    Substations, manholes and certain other distribution assets
    within Detroit Edison have an indeterminate life. Therefore, no
    liability has been recorded for these assets.

    plant, decommissioning expenditures for Fermi 2 are expected to
    be incurred primarily during the period of 2025 through 2050. It
    is estimated that the cost of decommissioning Fermi 2, when its
    license expires in 2025, will be $1.3 billion in 2009
    dollars and $3.4 billion in 2025 dollars, using a 6%
    inflation rate. In 2001, Detroit Edison began the
    decommissioning of Fermi 1, with the goal of removing the
    radioactive material and terminating the Fermi 1 license. The
    decommissioning of Fermi 1 is expected to be completed by 2012.
    Approximately $1.2 billion of the asset retirement
    obligations represent nuclear decommissioning liabilities that
    are funded through a surcharge to electric customers over the
    life of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant.

The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear
    power plants and requires decommissioning funding based upon a
    formula. The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of
    decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of
    external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi 2.
    Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of
    decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level
    radioactive waste. Detroit Edison is continuing to
    fund FERC jurisdictional amounts for decommissioning even
    though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates. The
    Company believes the MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate
    to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning using the NRC
    formula. The decommissioning assets, anticipated earnings
    thereon and future revenues from decommissioning collections
    will be used to decommission Fermi 2. The Company expects the
    liabilities to be reduced to zero at the conclusion of the
    decommissioning activities. If amounts remain in the trust funds
    for Fermi 2 following the completion of the decommissioning
    activities, those amounts will be disbursed based on rulings by
    the MPSC and FERC.

A portion of the funds recovered through the Fermi 2
    decommissioning surcharge and deposited in external trust
    accounts is designated for the removal of non-radioactive assets
    and the

clean-up

of
    the Fermi

site. This removal and

clean-up

is
    not considered a legal liability. Therefore, it is not included
    in the asset retirement obligation, but is reflected as the
    nuclear decommissioning liability. The decommissioning of Fermi
    1 is funded by Detroit Edison. Contributions to the Fermi 1
    trust are discretionary. See Note 4 for additional
    discussion of Nuclear Decommissioning
    Trust Fund Assets.

    DISPOSALS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Sale
    of Gathering and Processing Assets

In 2009, the Company sold certain non-strategic gas gathering
    and processing assets in northern Michigan for gross proceeds of
    approximately $45 million, which approximated its carrying
    value, including allocated goodwill.

Sale
    of Interest in Barnett Shale Properties

In 2008, the Company sold a portion of its Barnett shale
    properties for gross proceeds of approximately
    $260 million. The Company recognized a gain of
    $128 million ($80 million after-tax) on the sale
    during 2008.

Sale
    of Antrim Shale Gas Exploration and Production
    Business

In 2007, the Company sold its Antrim shale gas exploration and
    production business (Antrim) for gross proceeds of
    $1.3 billion. The pre-tax gain recognized on this sale
    amounted to $900 million ($580 million after-tax) and
    is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations under
    the line item, “Gain on sale of non-utility business,”
    and included in the Corporate & Other segment. Prior
    to the sale, the operating results of Antrim were reflected in
    the Unconventional Gas Production segment. The Antrim business
    is not presented as a discontinued operation due to continuation
    of cash flows related to the sale of a portion of Antrim’s
    natural gas production to Energy Trading under the terms of
    natural gas sales contracts that expire in 2010 and 2012.

Prior to the sale, a substantial portion of the Company’s
    price risk related to expected gas production from its Antrim
    shale business had been hedged through 2013. These financial
    contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges, with changes
    in estimated fair value of the contracts reflected in other
    comprehensive income. Upon the sale of Antrim, the financial
    contracts no longer qualified as cash flow hedges. In
    conjunction with the Antrim sale, the Company reclassified
    amounts held in accumulated other comprehensive income and
    recorded the effective settlements, reducing operating revenues
    in 2007 by $323 million.

Plan
    to Sell Interest in Certain Power and Industrial
    Projects

During the third quarter of 2007, the Company announced its
    plans to sell a 50% interest in a portfolio of select Power and
    Industrial Projects. As a result, the assets and liabilities of
    the Projects were classified as held for sale at that time and
    the Company ceased recording depreciation and amortization
    expense related to these assets. During 2008, the Company’s
    work on this planned monetization was discontinued. As of
    June 30, 2008, the assets and liabilities of the Projects
    were no longer classified as held for sale. Depreciation and
    amortization resumed in June 2008 when the assets were
    reclassified as held and used. During the second quarter of
    2008, the Company recorded a loss of $19 million related to
    the valuation adjustment for the cumulative depreciation and
    amortization not recorded during the held for sale period.

Synthetic
    Fuel Business

The Company discontinued the operations of its synthetic fuel
    production facilities throughout the United States as of
    December 31, 2007. Synfuel plants chemically changed coal
    and waste coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the
    Internal Revenue Code. Production tax credits were provided for
    the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from
    coal and were available through December 31, 2007. The
    synthetic fuel business generated operating losses that were
    substantially offset by production tax credits.

The Company has provided certain guarantees and indemnities in
    conjunction with the sales of interests in its synfuel
    facilities. The guarantees cover potential commercial,
    environmental, oil price and tax-related obligations and will
    survive until 90 days after expiration of all applicable
    statutes of limitations. The Company estimates that its maximum
    potential liability under these guarantees at December 31,
    2009 is $2.8 billion.

    OTHER IMPAIRMENTS AND RESTRUCTURING

Other
    Impairments — Barnett Shale

Our Unconventional Gas Production segment recorded pre-tax
    impairment losses of $6 million, $8 million and
    $27 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    impairments related primarily to the write-off of leases that
    expired or will expire within the next twelve months that are
    not expected to be developed under current economic conditions.

Restructuring
    Costs

In 2005, the Company initiated a company-wide review of its
    operations called the Performance Excellence Process.
    Specifically, the Company began a series of focused improvement
    initiatives within Detroit Edison and MichCon, and associated
    corporate support functions. The Company incurred costs to
    achieve (CTA) restructuring expense for employee severance and
    other costs. Other costs include project management and
    consultant support. In September 2006, the MPSC issued an order
    approving a settlement agreement that allows Detroit Edison and
    MichCon, commencing in 2006, to defer the incremental CTA.
    Further, the order provides for Detroit Edison and MichCon to
    amortize the CTA deferrals over a ten-year period beginning with
    the year subsequent to the year the CTA was deferred. Detroit
    Edison deferred approximately $24 million and
    $54 million of CTA in 2008 and 2007 as a regulatory asset.
    The recovery of these costs was provided for by the MPSC in the
    order approving the settlement in the show cause proceeding and
    in the December 23, 2008



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial

MPSC rate order. Amortization of prior year deferred CTA costs
    amounted to $18 million in 2009, $16 million in 2008
    and $10 million in 2007. MichCon cannot defer CTA costs at
    this time because a regulatory recovery mechanism has not been
    established by the MPSC. MichCon is seeking a recovery mechanism
    in its rate case filed in June 2009.

Amounts expensed are recorded in Operation and maintenance
    expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deferred
    amounts are recorded in Regulatory assets on the Consolidated
    Statements of Financial Position. Costs incurred in 2008 and

    REGULATORY MATTERS

Regulation

Detroit Edison and MichCon are subject to the regulatory
    jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to
    rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of
    generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of
    service, accounting and operating-related matters. Detroit
    Edison is also regulated by the FERC with respect to financing
    authorization and wholesale electric activities. Regulation
    results in differences in the application of generally accepted
    accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated
    businesses.

Regulatory
    Assets and Liabilities

Detroit Edison and MichCon are required to record regulatory
    assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have
    been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses.
    Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment
    requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of
    providing regulated services and be charged to and collected
    from customers. Future regulatory changes or changes in the
    competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of
    this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities
    for some or all of our businesses and may require the write-off
    of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no
    longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management
    believes that currently available facts support the continued
    use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory
    assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the
    current rate environment.

As noted below, regulatory assets for which costs have been
    incurred have been included (or are expected to be included, for
    costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate
    case) in Detroit Edison or MichCon’s rate base, thereby
    providing a return on invested costs. Certain regulatory assets
    do not result from cash expenditures and therefore do not
    represent investments included in rate base or have offsetting
    liabilities that reduce rate base.

ASSETS

•

Recoverable pension and postretirement costs

— In 2007, the Company adopted ASC 715
    (SFAS No. 158) which required, among other
    things, the recognition in other comprehensive income of the
    actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs that arise
    during the period but that are not immediately recognized as
    components of net periodic benefit costs. Detroit Edison and
    MichCon record the charge related to the additional liability as
    a regulatory asset since the traditional rate setting process
    allows for the recovery of pension and postretirement costs. The
    asset will reverse as the deferred items are recognized as
    benefit expenses in net
    income.

(1)

•

Recoverable income taxes related to securitized regulatory
    assets

— Receivable for the recovery of income
    taxes to be paid on the non-bypassable securitization bond
    surcharge. A non-bypassable securitization tax surcharge
    recovers the income tax over a fourteen-year period ending 2015.

•

Asset retirement obligation

— This obligation
    is primarily for Fermi 2 decommissioning costs. The asset
    captures the timing differences between expense recognition and
    current recovery in rates and will reverse over the remaining
    life of the related
    plant.

(1)

•

Deferred income taxes — Michigan Business Tax
    (MBT)

— In July 2007, the MBT was enacted by the
    State of Michigan. State deferred tax liabilities were
    established for the Company’s utilities, and offsetting
    regulatory assets were recorded as the impacts of the deferred
    tax liabilities will be reflected in rates as the related
    taxable temporary differences reverse and flow through current
    income tax
    expense.

(1)

•

Recoverable uncollectible expense

— MichCon and
    Detroit Edison receivable for the MPSC approved uncollectible
    expense tracking mechanism that tracks the difference in the
    fluctuation in uncollectible accounts and amounts recognized
    pursuant to the MPSC authorization.

•

Cost to achieve Performance Excellence Process (PEP)

— The MPSC authorized the deferral of costs to
    implement the PEP. These costs consist of employee severance,
    project management and consultant support. These costs will be
    amortized over a ten-year period beginning with the year
    subsequent to the year the costs were
    deferred.

(1)

•

Other recoverable income taxes

— Income taxes
    receivable from Detroit Edison’s customers representing the
    difference in property-related deferred income taxes receivable
    and amounts previously reflected in Detroit Edison’s rates.
    This asset will reverse over the remaining life of the related
    plant.

(1)

•

Unamortized loss on reacquired debt

— The
    unamortized discount, premium and expense related to debt
    redeemed with a refinancing are deferred, amortized and
    recovered over the life of the replacement
    issue.

(1)

•

Deferred environmental costs

— The MPSC
    approved the deferral and recovery of investigation and
    remediation costs associated with Gas Utility’s former MGP
    sites. This asset is offset in working capital by an
    environmental liability reserve. The amortization of the
    regulatory asset is not included in MichCon’s current rates
    because it is offset by the recognition of insurance proceeds.
    MichCon will request recovery of the remaining asset balance in
    future rate filings after the recognition of insurance proceeds
    is
    complete.

(1)



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

Enterprise Business Systems (EBS) costs

— The
    MPSC approved the deferral and amortization over 10 years
    beginning in January 2009 of EBS costs that would otherwise be
    expensed.

(1)

•

Excess capital expenditures

— PA 141 permits,
    after MPSC authorization, the recovery of and a return on
    capital expenditures that exceed a base level of depreciation
    expense.

•

Deferred Clean Air Act expenditures

— PA 141
    permits, after MPSC authorization, the recovery of and a return
    on Clean Air Act expenditures.

•

Midwest Independent System Operator charges

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization, the
    recovery of and a return on charges from a regional transmission
    operator such as the Midwest Independent System Operator.

•

Electric Customer Choice implementation costs

— PA 141 permits, after MPSC authorization, the
    recovery of and a return on costs incurred associated with the
    implementation of the electric Customer Choice program.

•

Accrued PSCR revenue

— Receivable for the
    temporary under-recovery of and a return on fuel and purchased
    power costs incurred by Detroit Edison which are recoverable
    through the PSCR mechanism.

•

Accrued GCR revenue

— Receivable for the
    temporary under-recovery of and a return on gas costs incurred
    by MichCon which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.

•

Securitized regulatory assets

— The net book
    balance of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant was written off in 1998 and
    an equivalent regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the
    Fermi 2 regulatory asset and certain other regulatory assets
    were securitized pursuant to PA 142 and an MPSC order. A
    non-bypassable securitization bond surcharge recovers the
    securitized regulatory asset over a fourteen-year period ending
    in 2015.

(1)

Regulatory assets not earning a return.

LIABILITIES

•

Asset removal costs

— The amount collected from
    customers for the funding of future asset removal activities.

•

Deferred income taxes — Michigan Business
    Tax —

In July 2007, the MBT was enacted by the
    State of Michigan. State deferred tax assets were established
    for the Company’s utilities, and offsetting regulatory
    liabilities were recorded as the impacts of the deferred tax
    assets will be reflected in rates.

•

Pension equalization mechanism —

Pension
    expense refundable to customers representing the difference
    created from volatility in the pension obligation and amounts
    recognized pursuant to MPSC authorization.

•

Negative pension offset —

MichCon’s
    negative pension costs are not included as a reduction to its
    authorized rates; therefore, the Company is accruing a
    regulatory liability to eliminate the impact on earnings of the
    negative pension expense accrued. This regulatory liability will
    reverse to the extent MichCon’s pension expense is positive
    in future years.

•

Refundable income taxes

— Income taxes
    refundable to MichCon’s customers representing the
    difference in property-related deferred income taxes payable and
    amounts recognized pursuant to MPSC authorization.

•

Accrued PSCR refund

— Liability for the
    temporary over-recovery of and a return on power supply costs
    and transmission costs incurred by Detroit Edison which are
    recoverable through the PSCR mechanism.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

Accrued GCR refund —

Liability for the
    temporary over-recovery of and a return on gas costs incurred by
    MichCon which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.

•

Refundable costs under PA 141 —

Detroit
    Edison’s 2007 Choice Incentive Mechanism
    (CIM) reconciliation and allocation resulted in the
    elimination of Regulatory Asset Recovery Surcharge (RARS)
    balances for commercial and industrial customers. RARS revenues
    received that exceed the regulatory asset balances are required
    to be refunded to the affected classes.

•

Fermi 2 refueling outage

— Accrued liability
    for refueling outage at Fermi 2 pursuant to MPSC authorization.

•

Renewable energy —

Amounts collected in rates
    in excess of renewable energy expenditures.

•

Refundable self implemented rates —

Amounts
    refundable to customers for base rates implemented from
    July 26, 2009 to December 31, 2009 in excess of
    amounts authorized in the January 2010 Detroit Edison MPSC order.

•

Refundable restoration expense —

Amounts
    refundable for the MPSC approved restoration expenses tracking
    mechanism that tracks the difference between actual restoration
    expense and the amount provided for in base rates, recognized
    pursuant to the MPSC authorization.

    Electric Rate Case Filing

On January 11, 2010, the MPSC issued an order in Detroit
    Edison’s January 26, 2009 rate case filing. The MPSC
    approved an annual revenue increase of $217 million or a
    4.8% increase in Detroit Edison’s annual revenue
    requirement for 2010. Included in the approved increase in
    revenues was a return on equity of 11% on an expected 49% equity
    and 51% debt capital structure. Since the final rate relief
    ordered was less than the Company’s self-implemented rate
    increase of $280 million effective on July 26, 2009,
    the MPSC ordered refunds for the period the self-implemented
    rates were in effect. Detroit Edison has recorded a refund
    liability of $27 million at December 31, 2009
    representing the 2009 portion of the estimated refund due
    customers, including interest. The MPSC ordered Detroit Edison
    to file a refund plan by April 1, 2010.

Other key aspects of the MPSC order include the following:

•

Continued progress toward correcting the existing rate structure
    to more accurately reflect the actual cost of providing service
    to business customers;

•

Continued application of an adjustment mechanism for Electric
    Choice sales that reconciles actual customer choice sales with a
    base customer choice sales level of 1,586 GWh;

•

Continued application of adjustment mechanisms to track expenses
    associated with restoration costs (storm and non-storm related
    expenses) and line clearance expenses. Annual reconciliations
    will be required using a base expense level of $117 million
    and $47 million, respectively. The change in base expense
    level was applied effective as of the July 26, 2009
    self-implementation date;

•

Implementation of a pilot Revenue Decoupling Mechanism, that
    will compare actual non-weather normalized sales per customer
    with the base sales per customer level established in this case
    for the period February 1, 2010 to January 31, 2011;
    and

•

Implementation of an Uncollectible Expense Tracking Mechanism,
    based on a $66 million expense level, with an
    80/20 percent sharing of the expenses above or below the
    base amount. The Uncollectible Expenses Tracking Mechanism was
    applied effective as of the July 26, 2009
    self-implementation date.

Renewable
    Energy Plan

In March 2009, Detroit Edison filed its Renewable Energy Plan
    with the MPSC as required under 2008 PA 295. The Renewable
    Energy Plan application requests authority to recover
    approximately $35 million of additional revenue in 2009.
    The proposed revenue increase is necessary in order to properly
    implement Detroit Edison’s

20-year

renewable energy plan to address the provisions of 2008 PA 295,
    to deliver cleaner, renewable electric generation to its
    customers, to further diversify Detroit Edison’s and the
    State of Michigan’s sources of electric supply, and to
    address the state and national goals of increasing energy
    independence. An MPSC order was issued June 2, 2009
    approving the renewable energy plan and customer surcharges. The
    Renewable Energy Plan surcharges became effective in September
    2009.

Energy
    Optimization Plans

In March 2009, Detroit Edison and MichCon filed Energy
    Optimization Plans with the MPSC as required under 2008 PA 295.
    The Energy Optimization Plan applications are designed to help
    each customer class reduce their electric and gas usage by:
    (1) building customer awareness of energy efficiency
    options and (2) offering a diverse set of programs and
    participation options that result in energy savings for each
    customer class. Detroit Edison’s Energy Optimization Plan
    application proposed energy optimization expenditures for the
    period

2009-2011

of
    $134 million and further requests approval of surcharges
    that are designed to recover these costs. MichCon’s Energy
    Optimization Plan application proposed energy optimization
    expenditures for the period

2009-2011

of
    $55 million and further requests approval of surcharges
    that are designed to recover these costs. An MPSC order was
    issued June 2, 2009 approving the Energy Optimization Plans
    of $117 million and $48 million for Detroit Edison and
    MichCon, respectively. The surcharges to recover these costs
    were implemented effective June 3, 2009. An MPSC order was
    issued September 29, 2009 approving incentive mechanisms
    for both utilities. The mechanism allows a maximum payout of 15%
    of program expenditures when the utility meets or exceeds the
    savings target by 15%.

    Detroit Edison Depreciation Filing

In 2007, the MPSC ordered Michigan utilities to file
    depreciation studies using the current method, an approach that
    considers the time value of money and an inflation adjusted
    method proposed by the Company that removes excess escalation.
    In compliance with the MPSC order, Detroit Edison filed its
    ordered depreciation studies in November 2009. The various
    required depreciation studies indicate composite depreciation
    rates from 3.05% to 3.54%. The Company has proposed no change to
    its current composite depreciation rate of 3.33%. The Company
    expects an order in this proceeding in the fourth quarter of
    2010.

Power
    Supply Cost Recovery Proceedings

The PSCR process is designed to allow us to recover all of our
    power supply costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent
    policies and practices. Our power supply costs include fuel
    costs, purchased and net interchange power costs, nitrogen oxide
    and sulfur dioxide emission allowances costs, transmission costs
    and MISO costs. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies and
    practices for prudence in annual plan and reconciliation filings.

2007 Plan Year

— An MPSC order was issued on

2009 Plan Year

— In September 2008, Detroit
    Edison submitted its 2009 PSCR plan filing to the MPSC. The plan
    includes the recovery of its 2008 PSCR under-collection from all
    customers and the refund of its 2005 PSCR reconciliation
    surcharge over-collection to commercial and industrial customers
    only. On June 29, 2009, the parties to this proceeding
    submitted a Settlement Agreement in this matter agreeing to
    maximum PSCR factors of 1.67 mills/kWh for residential customers
    and 1.35 mills/kWh for commercial and industrial customers and
    otherwise resolving this 2009 PSCR Plan case. An MPSC order was
    issued on January 25, 2010 approving the settlement.

2010 Plan Year

— In September 2009, Detroit
    Edison submitted its 2010 PSCR plan case seeking approval of a
    levelized PSCR factor of 5.64 mills/kWh below the amount
    included in base rates for all PSCR customers. The filing
    supports a 2010 power supply expense forecast of
    $1.2 billion. Also included in the filing is a request for
    approval of the Company’s expense associated with the use
    of urea in the selective catalytic reduction units at Monroe
    power plant as well as a request for approval of a contract for
    capacity and energy associated with a wind energy project. The
    Company has also requested authority to recover transfer prices
    for renewable energy, coke oven gas expense and other potential
    expenses.

    Gas Rate Case Filing

MichCon filed a general rate case on June 9, 2009 based on
    a 2008 historical test year. The filing with the MPSC requested
    a $193 million, or 11.5 percent average increase in
    MichCon’s annual revenues for a 2010 projected test year.
    The requested $193 million increase in revenues is required
    to recover the increased costs associated with increased
    investments in net plant and working capital, the impact of high
    levels of uncollectible expense and the cost of natural gas
    theft primarily due to economic conditions in Michigan, sales
    reductions due to customer conservation and the trend of warmer
    weather on MichCon’s market, and increasing operating
    costs, largely due to inflation.

In addition, MichCon’s filing made, among other requests,
    the following proposals:

•

Implementation of a Lost Gas and Company Use — Expense
    Tracking Mechanism;

•

Continued application of an uncollectible expense tracking
    mechanism based on a $70 million expense level of
    uncollectible expenses; and,

•

Implementation of a revenue decoupling
    mechanism.  Revenue decoupling is an adjustment
    mechanism that would provide revenues consistent with the
    allowed revenue requirement with a periodic adjustment for
    changes in sales levels.

Pursuant to the October 2008 Michigan legislation, and the
    settlement in MichCon’s last base gas sale case, MichCon
    self-implemented $170 million of its requested annual
    increase on January 1, 2010. This increase will remain in
    place until a final order is issued by the MPSC, which is
    expected in June 2010. If the final rate case order does not
    support the self-implemented rate increase, MichCon must refund
    the difference with interest.

    MichCon Depreciation Filing

In 2007, the MPSC ordered Michigan utilities to file
    depreciation studies using the current method, an approach that
    considers the time value of money and an inflation adjusted
    method proposed by the Company that removes excess escalation.
    In compliance with the MPSC order MichCon filed its ordered
    depreciation studies in November 2008. The various required
    depreciation studies indicate composite depreciation rates from
    2.07% to 2.55%. The Company has proposed no change to its
    current composite depreciation rate of 2.97%. The Company
    expects an order in this proceeding in 2010.

Gas
    Cost Recovery Proceedings

The GCR process is designed to allow us to recover all of our
    gas supply costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent
    policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies
    and practices for prudence in annual plan and reconciliation
    filings.

    November 12, 2009 authorizing a base gas cost recovery
    factor of $8.46 per Mcf.

2010-2011

In December 2009, MichCon filed its
    GCR plan case for the

2010-2011

GCR plan year. MichCon filed for a maximum GCR factor of $7.06
    per Mcf, adjustable by a contingent mechanism.

2009 Base Gas Sale

— In July 2008, MichCon
    filed an application with the MPSC requesting permission to sell
    an additional 4 Bcf of base gas that will become available
    for sale as a result of better than expected operations at its
    storage fields. In February 2009, a settlement agreement was
    filed with the MPSC, which will allow MichCon to sell and retain
    the profits of 2 Bcf of base gas, with the remaining
    2 Bcf to be used for the benefit of GCR customers as

colder-than-normal

weather protection. An MPSC order was issued March 5, 2009
    approving the settlement. MichCon sold 2 Bcf of base gas in
    December 2009 at a pre-tax gain of $9 million.

2007-2008

Plan Year / Base Gas Sale Consolidated —

In August
    2006, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC requesting
    permission to sell base gas that would become accessible with
    storage facilities upgrades. In August 2007, a settlement
    agreement in this proceeding was reached by all intervening
    parties that provided for a sharing with customers of the
    proceeds from the sale of base gas. In addition, the agreement
    provided for a rate case filing moratorium until January 1,
    2009, unless certain unanticipated changes occur that impact
    income by more than $5 million. The settlement agreement
    was approved by the MPSC in August 2007. Under the settlement
    terms, MichCon delivered 13.4 Bcf of this gas to its customers
    through 2007 at a savings to market-priced supplies of
    approximately $41 million. This settlement also provided
    for MichCon to retain the proceeds from the sale of 3.6 Bcf of
    base gas, of which MichCon sold

    of $22 million.

Merger
    Control Premium Costs

In July 2007, the State of Michigan Court of Appeals published
    its decision with respect to an appeal by Detroit Edison and
    others of certain provisions of a November 2004 MPSC order,
    including reversing the MPSC’s denial of recovery of merger
    control premium costs. In its published decision, the Court of
    Appeals held that Detroit Edison is entitled to recover its
    allocated share of the merger control premium and remanded this
    matter to the MPSC for further proceedings to establish the
    precise amount and timing of this recovery. In September 2007,
    the Court of Appeals remanded to the MPSC, for reconsideration,
    the MichCon recovery of merger control premium costs. Other
    parties filed requests for leave to appeal to the Michigan
    Supreme Court from the Court of Appeals decision and in
    September 2008, the Michigan Supreme Court granted the requests
    to address the merger control premium as well as the recovery of
    transmission costs through the PSCR. On May 1, 2009, the
    Michigan Supreme Court issued an order reversing the Court of
    Appeals decision with respect to recovery of the merger control
    premium, and reinstated the MPSC’s decision excluding the
    control premium costs from Detroit Edison’s general rates.
    The Court affirmed the lower court’s decision upholding the
    right of Detroit Edison to recover electric transmission costs
    through the Company’s PSCR clause. The Company requested
    rehearing of the Supreme Court order on the merger premium and
    the Michigan Attorney General requested rehearing of the
    transmission portion of the order. On June 26, 2009, the
    Michigan Supreme Court denied both requests for rehearing. On
    September 29, 2009, the MPSC granted MichCon’s
    June 1, 2009 Motion for Commission’s Decision and
    Remand for Control Premium Recovery but denied MichCon’s
    requested rate relief by reaffirming the MPSC’s denial of
    recovery of MichCon’s portion of the control premium in
    MichCon’s last rate case. The above actions did not have an
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Other

The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the unresolved
    regulatory matters discussed herein. Resolution of these matters
    is dependent upon future MPSC orders and appeals, which may
    materially impact the financial position, results of operations
    and cash flows of the Company.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    estimated future tax effect of temporary differences between the
    tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts in
    the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are classified as current or noncurrent according to the
    classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred
    tax assets and liabilities not related to assets or liabilities
    are classified according to the expected reversal date of the
    temporary differences. Consistent with rate making treatment,
    deferred taxes are offset in the table below for temporary
    differences which have related regulatory assets and liabilities.

Production tax credits earned in prior years but not utilized
    totaled $197 million and are carried forward indefinitely
    as alternative minimum tax credits. The majority of the
    production tax credits earned, including all of those from our
    synfuel projects, were generated from projects that had received
    a private letter ruling (PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service
    (IRS). These PLRs provide assurance as to the appropriateness of
    using these credits to offset taxable income, however, these tax
    credits are subject to IRS audit and adjustment.

The above table excludes deferred tax liabilities associated
    with unamortized investment tax credits that are shown
    separately on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
    Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over
    the average life of the related property.

The Company has state deferred tax assets related to net
    operating loss and credit carry-forwards of $43 million and
    $42 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The state net operating loss and credit
    carry-forwards expire from 2010 through 2029. The Company has
    recorded valuation allowances at December 31, 2009 and 2008
    of approximately $43 million and $42 million,
    respectively, a change of $1 million, with respect to these
    deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred
    tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than
    not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
    be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
    dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
    the periods in which those temporary differences become
    deductible. Based upon the level of historical taxable income
    and projections for future taxable income over the periods which
    the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes it
    is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of
    those deductible differences, net of the existing valuation
    allowance as of December 31, 2009.

The Company has $7 million of unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2009, that, if recognized, would favorably
    impact our effective tax rate. During the next twelve months, it
    is reasonably possible that the Company will settle certain
    state tax examinations and audits. Furthermore, during the next
    twelve months, statutes of limitations will expire for the
    Company’s tax returns in various states. Therefore, as of
    December 31, 2009, the Company believes that it is
    reasonably possible that there will be a decrease in
    unrecognized tax benefits of up to $2 million within the
    next twelve months.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties pertaining to
    income taxes in Interest expense and Other expenses,
    respectively, on its Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    Accrued interest pertaining to income taxes totaled
    $6 million and $8 million at December 31, 2009
    and December 31, 2008, respectively. The Company had no
    accrued penalties pertaining to income taxes. The Company
    recognized interest expense related to income taxes of
    $(2) million, $2 million and $1 million in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

In 2009, the Company settled a federal tax audit for the 2004
    through 2006 tax years, which resulted in the recognition of
    $9 million of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s
    U.S. federal income tax returns for years 2007 and
    subsequent years remain subject to examination by the IRS. The
    Company’s Michigan Business Tax for the year 2008 is
    subject to examination by the State of Michigan. The Company
    also files tax returns in numerous state and local jurisdictions
    with varying statutes of limitation.

Michigan
    Business Tax

In July 2007, the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) was enacted by the
    State of Michigan to replace the Michigan Single Business Tax
    (MSBT) effective January 1, 2008. The MBT is comprised of
    an apportioned modified gross receipts tax of 0.8 percent;
    and an apportioned business income tax of 4.95 percent. The
    MBT provides credits for Michigan business investment,
    compensation, and research and development. Legislation was also
    enacted, in 2007, by the State of Michigan creating a deduction
    for businesses that realize an increase in their deferred tax
    liability due to the enactment of the MBT. The MBT is accounted
    for as an income tax.

The MBT consolidated deferred tax liability balance is
    $357 million as of December 31, 2009 and is reported
    net of the related federal tax benefit. The MBT deferred tax
    asset balance is $331 million as of December 31, 2009
    and is reported net of the related federal deferred tax
    liability. The utilities’ regulatory asset balance is
    $407 million and the regulatory liability balance is
    $423 million as of December 31, 2009 and is further
    discussed in Note 12.

NOTE 14 —
    COMMON STOCK

Common
    Stock

In May 2007, The DTE Energy Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $850 million of common stock through
    2009. During 2009, no repurchases of common stock were made
    under this authorization that expired on December 31, 2009.

Under the DTE Energy Company Long-Term Incentive Plan, the
    Company grants non-vested stock awards to key employees,
    primarily management. As a result of a stock award, a settlement
    of an award of performance shares, or by exercise of a
    participant’s stock option, the Company may deliver common
    stock from the Company’s authorized but unissued common
    stock

and/or

from outstanding common stock acquired by or on behalf of the
    Company in the name of the participant.

Dividends

Certain of the Company’s credit facilities contain a
    provision requiring the Company to maintain a total funded debt
    to capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, of no
    more than 0.65 to 1, which has the effect of limiting the amount
    of dividends the Company can pay in order to maintain compliance
    with this provision. The effect of this provision as of
    December 31, 2009 was to restrict the payment of
    approximately $268 million of total retained earnings of
    approximately $3.2 billion. There are no other effective
    limitations with respect to the Company’s ability to pay
    dividends.

NOTE 15 —
    EARNINGS PER SHARE

The Company reports both basic and diluted earnings per share.
    The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes the
    issuance of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding
    during the period from the exercise of stock options. Effective
    January 1, 2009, the adoption of new accounting
    requirements clarifying the definition of participating
    securities to be included in the earnings per share calculation
    had the effect of reducing previously reported 2008 amounts for
    basic and diluted earnings per share by $.03 and $.02,



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

respectively. The corresponding reduction in 2007 for basic and
    diluted earnings per share was $.03 and $.01, respectively. A

Trust Preferred-Linked

Securities

DTE Energy has interests in various unconsolidated trusts that
    were formed for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities
    and lending the gross proceeds to the Company. The sole assets
    of the trusts are



DTE

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

debt securities of DTE Energy with terms similar to those of the
    related preferred securities. Payments the Company makes are
    used by the trusts to make cash distributions on the preferred
    securities it has issued.

The Company has the right to extend interest payment periods on
    the debt securities. Should the Company exercise this right, it
    cannot declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or
    acquire, any of its capital stock during the deferral period.

DTE Energy has issued certain guarantees with respect to
    payments on the preferred securities. These guarantees, when
    taken together with the Company’s obligations under the
    debt securities and related indenture, provide full and
    unconditional guarantees of the trusts’ obligations under
    the preferred securities.

Financing costs for these issuances were paid for and deferred
    by DTE Energy. These costs are being amortized using the
    straight-line method over the estimated lives of the related
    securities.

Cross
    Default Provisions

Substantially all of the net utility properties of Detroit
    Edison and MichCon are subject to the lien of mortgages. Should
    Detroit Edison or MichCon fail to timely pay their indebtedness
    under these mortgages, such failure may create cross defaults in
    the indebtedness of DTE Energy.

    SHORT-TERM CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS

DTE Energy and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Detroit Edison and
    MichCon, have entered into revolving credit facilities with
    similar terms. The five-year and two-year revolving credit
    facilities are with a syndicate of 22 banks and may be used for
    general corporate borrowings, but are intended to provide
    liquidity support for each of the companies’ commercial
    paper programs. No one bank provides more than 8.5% of the
    commitment in any facility. Borrowings under the facilities are
    available at prevailing short-term interest rates. Additionally,
    DTE Energy has other facilities to support letter of credit
    issuance. The above agreements require the Company to maintain a
    total funded debt to capitalization ratio, as defined in the
    agreements, of no more than 0.65 to 1. At December 31,
    2009, the debt to total capitalization ratios for DTE Energy,
    Detroit Edison and MichCon are 0.51 to 1, 0.52 to 1 and 0.49 to
    1, respectively, and are in compliance with this

    corporate purposes.

The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was
    0.7% and 3.9% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In April 2009, the Company completed an early renewal of
    $975 million of its syndicated revolving credit facilities
    before their scheduled expiration in October 2009. The new
    $1 billion two-year facility will expire in April 2011 and
    has similar covenants to the prior facility. A new two-year
    $50 million credit facility was completed in May 2009 and a
    new one-year $70 million facility was completed in June
    2009.

In conjunction with maintaining certain exchange traded risk
    management positions, the Company may be required to post cash
    collateral with its clearing agent. The Company has a demand
    financing agreement for up to $120 million with its
    clearing agent which was increased from $50 million in June
    2009. The amount outstanding under this agreement was
    $1 million and $26 million at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

Electric
    Utility

Air

— Detroit Edison is subject to EPA ozone
    transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant
    emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Since 2005, EPA
    and the State of Michigan have issued additional emission
    reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate,
    regional haze and mercury air pollution. The new rules will lead
    to additional controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce
    nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. To comply
    with these requirements, Detroit Edison has spent approximately
    $1.5 billion through 2009. The Company estimates Detroit
    Edison will make future undiscounted capital expenditures of up
    to $73 million in 2010 and up to $2.2 billion of
    additional capital expenditures through 2019 based on current
    regulations. Further, additional rulemakings are expected over
    the next few years which could require additional controls for
    sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and hazardous air pollutants. It
    is not possible to quantify the impact of those expected
    rulemakings at this time.

In July 2009, DTE Energy received a Notice of Violation/Finding
    of Violation (NOV/FOV) from the EPA alleging, among other
    things, that five Detroit Edison power plants violated New
    Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant
    Deterioration requirements, and Title V operating permit
    requirements under the Clean Air Act. We believe that the plants
    identified by the EPA have complied with applicable regulations.
    Depending upon the outcome of our discussions with the EPA
    regarding the NOV/FOV, the EPA could bring legal action against
    Detroit Edison. We could also be required to install additional
    pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants
    in question, engage in Supplemental Environmental Programs,

and/or

pay
    fines. We cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this
    matter, or the timing of its resolution.

Water

— In response to an EPA regulation,
    Detroit Edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing
    the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures
    at several of its facilities. Based on the results of completed
    studies and expected future studies, Detroit Edison may be
    required to install additional control technologies to reduce
    the impacts of the water intakes. Initially, it was estimated
    that Detroit Edison could incur up to approximately
    $55 million over the four to six years subsequent to 2008
    in additional capital expenditures to comply with these
    requirements. However, a January 2007 circuit court decision
    remanded back to the EPA several provisions of the federal
    regulation that may result in a delay in compliance dates. The
    decision also raised the possibility that Detroit Edison may
    have to install cooling towers at some facilities at a cost
    substantially greater than was initially estimated for other
    mitigative technologies. In 2008, the Supreme Court agreed to
    review the remanded cost-benefit analysis provision of the rule
    and in April 2009 upheld EPA’s use of this provision in
    determining best technology available for reducing environmental
    impacts. Concurrently, the EPA continues to develop a revised
    rule, a draft of which is expected to be published by summer
    2010. The EPA has also proposed an information collection
    request to begin a review of steam electric effluent guidelines.
    It is not possible at this time to quantify the impacts of these
    developing requirements.

Contaminated Sites

— Detroit Edison conducted
    remedial investigations at contaminated sites, including three
    former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites. The investigations
    have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas
    manufacturing at each site. In addition to the MGP sites, the
    Company is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated
    sites, including the area surrounding an ash landfill,
    electrical distribution substations, and underground and
    aboveground storage tank locations. The findings of these
    investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate
    these sites is expected to be incurred over the next several
    years. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had
    $9 million and $12 million, respectively, accrued for
    remediation.



DTE
    Energy Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Landfill

— Detroit Edison owns and operates a
    permitted engineered ash storage facility at the Monroe Power
    Plant to dispose of fly ash from the coal fired power plant.
    Detroit Edison performed an engineering analysis in 2009 and
    identified the need for embankment side slope repairs and
    reconstruction.

Gas
    Utility

Contaminated Sites

— Prior to the construction
    of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and
    other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving
    coal, coke or oil. Gas Utility owns, or previously owned, 15
    such former MGP sites. Investigations have revealed
    contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at
    each site. In addition to the MGP sites, the Company is also in
    the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites. Cleanup
    activities associated with these sites will be conducted over
    the next several years.

The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery
    mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at
    former MGP sites. Accordingly, Gas Utility recognizes a
    liability and corresponding regulatory asset for estimated
    investigation and remediation costs at former MGP sites. During
    2009, the Company spent approximately $1 million
    investigating and remediating these former MGP sites. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had
    $36 million and $38 million, respectively, accrued for
    remediation.

Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation
    techniques, nature and extent of contamination and regulatory
    requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs
    for the sites and affect the Company’s financial position
    and cash flows. However, the Company anticipates the cost
    deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the MPSC will
    prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse
    impact on our results of operations.

Non-Utility

The Company’s non-utility affiliates are subject to a
    number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the
    protection of the environment from various pollutants. The
    Michigan coke battery facility received and responded to
    information requests from the EPA resulting in the issuance of a
    notice of violation regarding potential maximum achievable
    control technologies and new source review violations. The EPA
    is in the process of reviewing the Company’s position of
    demonstrated compliance and has not initiated escalated
    enforcement. At this time, the Company cannot predict the impact
    of this issue. Furthermore, the Company is in the process of
    settling historical air violations at its coke battery facility
    located in Pennsylvania. At this time, we cannot predict the
    impact of this settlement. The Company is investigating
    wastewater treatment technology upgrades for the coke battery
    facility located in Pennsylvania. This investigation may result
    in capital expenditures to meet regulatory requirements. The
    Company’s non-utility affiliates are substantially in
    compliance with all environmental requirements, other than as
    noted above.

Other

In February 2008, DTE Energy was named as one of approximately
    24 defendant oil, power and coal companies in a lawsuit filed in
    a United States District Court. DTE Energy was served with
    process in March 2008. The plaintiffs, the Native Village of
    Kivalina and City of Kivalina, which are home to approximately
    400 people in Alaska, claim that the defendants’
    business activities have contributed to global warming and, as a
    result, higher temperatures are damaging the local economy and
    leaving the island more vulnerable to storm activity in the fall
    and winter. As a result, the plaintiffs are seeking damages of
    up to $400 million for relocation costs associated with
    moving the village to a safer location, as well as unspecified
    attorney’s fees and expenses. On October 15, 2009, the
    U.S. District Court granted defendants’ motions
    dismissing all of plaintiffs’ federal claims in the case on
    two independent grounds: (1) the court lacks subject matter
    jurisdiction to hear the claims because of the political
    question doctrine; and (2) plaintiffs lack standing to
    bring their



DTE

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

claims. The court also dismissed plaintiffs’ state law
    claims because the court lacked supplemental jurisdiction over
    them after it dismissed the federal claims; the dismissal of the
    state law claims was without prejudice. The plaintiffs have
    appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Nuclear
    Operations

Property
    Insurance

Detroit Edison maintains several different types of property
    insurance policies specifically for the Fermi 2 plant. These
    policies cover such items as replacement power and property
    damage. The Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) is the
    primary supplier of the insurance policies.

Detroit Edison maintains a policy for extra expenses, including
    replacement power costs necessitated by Fermi 2’s
    unavailability due to an insured event. This policy has a
    12-week waiting period and provides an aggregate
    $490 million of coverage over a three-year period.

Detroit Edison has $500 million in primary coverage and
    $2.25 billion of excess coverage for stabilization,
    decontamination, debris removal, repair

and/or

replacement of property and decommissioning. The combined
    coverage limit for total property damage is $2.75 billion.

In 2007, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005
    (TRIA) was extended through December 31, 2014. A major
    change in the extension is the inclusion of “domestic”
    acts of terrorism in the definition of covered or
    “certified” acts. For multiple terrorism losses caused
    by acts of terrorism not covered under the TRIA occurring within
    one year after the first loss from terrorism, the NEIL policies
    would make available to all insured entities up to
    $3.2 billion, plus any amounts recovered from reinsurance,
    government indemnity, or other sources to cover losses.

Under the NEIL policies, Detroit Edison could be liable for
    maximum assessments of up to approximately $28 million per
    event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear
    plant in the United States should exceed the accumulated funds
    available to NEIL.

Public
    Liability Insurance

As of January 1, 2010, as required by federal law, Detroit
    Edison maintains $375 million of public liability insurance
    for a nuclear incident. For liabilities arising from a terrorist
    act outside the scope of TRIA, the policy is subject to one
    industry aggregate limit of $300 million. Further, under
    the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005, deferred premium
    charges up to $117.5 million could be levied against each
    licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $17.5 million
    per year per facility. Thus, deferred premium charges could be
    levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the
    event of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities.

Nuclear
    Fuel Disposal Costs

In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982,
    Detroit Edison has a contract with the U.S. Department of
    Energy (DOE) for the future storage and disposal of spent
    nuclear fuel from Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is obligated to pay
    the DOE a fee of 1 mill per kWh of Fermi 2 electricity generated
    and sold. The fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense. Delays
    have occurred in the DOE’s program for the acceptance and
    disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent repository and the
    proposed fiscal year 2011 federal budget recommends termination
    of funding for completion of the government’s long-term
    storage facility. Detroit Edison is a party in the litigation
    against the DOE for both past and future costs associated with
    the DOE’s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the
    timetable set forth in the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
    1982. Detroit Edison currently employs a spent nuclear fuel
    storage strategy utilizing a fuel pool. We have begun work on an

on-site

dry
    cask storage facility which is expected to provide sufficient
    storage capability for the life of the plant as defined by the
    original operating license. Issues relating to long-

term waste disposal policy and to the disposition of funds
    contributed by Detroit Edison ratepayers to the federal waste
    fund await future governmental action.

Guarantees

In certain limited circumstances, the Company enters into
    contractual guarantees. The Company may guarantee another
    entity’s obligation in the event it fails to perform. The
    Company may provide guarantees in certain indemnification
    agreements. Finally, the Company may provide indirect guarantees
    for the indebtedness of others. Below are the details of
    specific material guarantees the Company currently provides.

Millennium
    Pipeline Project Guarantee

The Company owns a 26 percent equity interest in the
    Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium). Millennium is
    accounted for under the equity method. Millennium began
    commercial operations in December 2008. In August 29, 2007,
    Millennium entered into a borrowing facility to finance the
    construction costs of the project. The total facility amounts to
    $800 million and is guaranteed by the project partners,
    based upon their respective ownership percentages. The facility
    expires on August 29, 2010 and was fully drawn as of
    December 31, 2009. Millennium anticipates refinancing its
    $800 million borrowing facility with a long-term financing
    non-recourse to the Company. The Company expects to make an
    additional equity contribution to Millennium in conjunction with
    the refinancing. The actual amount of the Company’s equity
    contribution will depend on the amount of the net proceeds from
    the long-term financing.

The Company has agreed to guarantee 26 percent of the
    borrowing facility and in the event of default by Millennium the
    maximum potential amount of future payments under this guarantee
    is approximately $210 million. The guarantee includes DTE
    Energy’s revolving credit facility’s covenant and
    default provisions by reference. Related to this facility, the
    Company has also agreed to guarantee 26 percent of
    Millennium’s forward-starting interest rate swaps with a
    notional amount of $420 million. The Company’s
    exposure on the forward-starting interest rate swaps varies with
    changes in Treasury rates and credit swap spreads and was
    approximately $10 million at December 31, 2009.
    Because the Company is unable to accurately anticipate changes
    in Treasury rates and credit swap spreads, it is unable to
    estimate its maximum exposure under its share of
    Millennium’s forward-starting interest rate swaps. An
    incremental 0.25 percent decrease in the forward interest
    rate swap rates will increase its exposure by approximately
    $3 million. There are no recourse provisions or collateral
    that would enable the Company to recover any amounts paid under
    the guarantees, other than its share of project assets.

Other
    Guarantees

Detroit Edison has guaranteed a bank term loan of
    $11 million related to the sale of its steam heating
    business to Thermal Ventures II, L.P. At December 31, 2009,
    the Company has reserves for the entire amount of the bank loan
    guarantee.

The Company’s other guarantees are not individually
    material with maximum potential payments totaling
    $10 million at December 31, 2009.

The Company is periodically required to obtain performance
    surety bonds in support of obligations to various governmental
    entities and other companies in connection with its operations.
    As of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately
    $12 million of performance bonds outstanding. In the event
    that such bonds are called for nonperformance, the Company would
    be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond.
    The Company is released from the performance bonds as the
    contractual performance is completed and does not believe that a
    material amount of any currently outstanding performance bonds
    will be called.

Labor
    Contracts

There are several bargaining units for the Company’s union
    employees. The majority of our union employees are under
    contracts that expire in June and October 2010 and August 2012.

Purchase
    Commitments

As of December 31, 2009, the Company was party to numerous
    long-term purchase commitments relating to a variety of goods
    and services required for the Company’s business. These
    agreements primarily consist of fuel supply commitments and
    energy trading contracts. The Company estimates that these
    commitments will be approximately $5 billion from 2010
    through 2051. The Company also estimates that 2010 capital
    expenditures will be approximately $1.4 billion. The
    Company has made certain commitments in connection with expected
    capital expenditures.

Bankruptcies

The Company purchases and sells electricity, gas, coal, coke and
    other energy products from and to numerous companies operating
    in the steel, automotive, energy, retail, financial and other
    industries. Certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy
    protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
    Code. The Company regularly reviews contingent matters relating
    to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and
    records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable
    loss. The Company believes its accrued amounts are adequate for
    probable loss. The final resolution of these matters may have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s utilities and certain non-utility businesses
    provide services to the domestic automotive industry, including
    General Motors Corporation (GM), Ford Motor Company (Ford) and
    Chrysler LLC (Chrysler) and many of their vendors and suppliers.
    Chrysler filed for bankruptcy protection on April 30, 2009.
    We have reserved approximately $9 million of pre-petition
    accounts receivable related to Chrysler as of December 31,
    2009. GM filed for bankruptcy protection on June 1, 2009.
    We have reserved or written off approximately $5 million of
    pre-petition accounts and notes receivable related to GM as of
    December 31, 2009.

Other
    Contingencies

The Company is involved in certain other legal, regulatory,
    administrative and environmental proceedings before various
    courts, arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning
    claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These
    proceedings include certain contract disputes, additional
    environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from
    various regulators, and pending judicial matters. The Company
    cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. The
    Company regularly reviews legal matters and records provisions
    for claims that it can estimate and are considered probable of
    loss. The resolution of these pending proceedings is not
    expected to have a material effect on the Company’s
    operations or financial statements in the periods they are
    resolved.

See Notes 5 and 12 for a discussion of contingencies
    related to derivatives and regulatory matters.

Pension
    Plan Benefits

The Company has qualified defined benefit retirement plans for
    eligible represented and non-represented employees. The plans
    are noncontributory and cover substantially all employees. The
    plans provide traditional retirement benefits based on the
    employees’ years of benefit service, average final
    compensation and age at retirement. In addition, certain
    represented and non-represented employees are covered under cash
    balance provisions that determine benefits on annual employer
    contributions and interest credits. The Company also maintains
    supplemental nonqualified, noncontributory, retirement benefit
    plans for selected management employees. These plans provide for
    benefits that supplement those provided by DTE Energy’s
    other retirement plans.

The Company’s policy is to fund pension costs by
    contributing amounts consistent with the Pension Protection Act
    of 2006 provisions and additional amounts when it deems
    appropriate. The Company anticipates making up to a
    $200 million contribution to its pension plans in 2010.

The Company employs a formal process in determining the
    long-term rate of return for various asset classes. Management
    reviews historic financial market risks and returns and
    long-term historic relationships between the asset classes of
    equities, fixed income and other assets, consistent with the
    widely accepted capital market principle that asset classes with
    higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-term.
    Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates, asset
    class risks and asset class returns are evaluated and considered
    before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The
    long-term portfolio return is also established employing a
    consistent formal process, with due consideration of
    diversification, active investment management and rebalancing.
    Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness.

At December 31, 2009, the benefits related to the
    Company’s qualified and nonqualified pension plans expected
    be paid in each of the next five years and in the aggregate for
    the five fiscal years thereafter are as follows:

The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a
    mix of equities, fixed income and other investments are used to
    maximize the long-term return on plan assets consistent with
    prudent levels of risk, with consideration given to the
    liquidity needs of the plan. The intent of this strategy is to
    minimize plan expenses over the long-term. Risk tolerance is
    established through consideration of future plan cash flows,
    plan funded status, and corporate financial considerations. The
    investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity,
    fixed income and other investments. Furthermore, equity
    investments are diversified across U.S. and

non-U.S. stocks,

growth and value investment styles, and large and small market
    capitalizations. Fixed income securities generally include
    corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries,
    mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Other
    assets such as private equity and hedge funds are used to
    enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio
    diversification. Derivatives may be utilized in a risk
    controlled manner, to potentially increase the portfolio beyond
    the market value of invested assets and reduce portfolio
    investment risk. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an
    ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic
    asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio
    reviews.

The pension trust holds debt and equity securities directly and
    indirectly through commingled funds and institutional mutual
    funds. Exchange-traded debt and equity securities held directly
    are valued using quoted market prices in actively traded
    markets. The commingled funds and institutional mutual funds
    which hold exchange-traded equity or debt securities are valued
    based on underlying securities, using quoted prices in actively
    traded markets. Non-exchange traded fixed income securities are
    valued by the trustee based upon quotations available from
    brokers or pricing services. A primary price source is
    identified by asset type, class or issue for each security. The
    trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use
    a supplemental price source or change the primary price source
    of a given security if the trustees challenge an assigned price
    and determine that another price source is considered to be
    preferable. DTE Energy has obtained an understanding of how
    these prices are derived, including the nature and observability
    of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, DTE
    Energy selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by
    comparison of market-based price sources.

The Company also sponsors defined contribution retirement
    savings plans. Participation in one of these plans is available
    to substantially all represented and non-represented employees.
    The Company matches employee contributions up to certain
    predefined limits based upon eligible compensation, the
    employee’s contribution rate and, in some cases, years of
    credited service. The cost of these plans was $33 million,
    $33 million, and $29 million in each of the years
    2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Other
    Postretirement Benefits

The Company provides certain postretirement health care and life
    insurance benefits for employees who are eligible for these
    benefits. The Company’s policy is to fund certain trusts to
    meet its postretirement benefit obligations. Separate qualified
    Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) and 401(h)
    trusts exist for represented and non-represented employees. At
    the discretion of management, the Company may make up to an
    additional $130 million contribution to its VEBA trusts in
    2010.

NOTE 22 —
    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company’s stock incentive program permits the grant of
    incentive stock options, non-qualifying stock options, stock
    awards, performance shares and performance units to employees
    and members of its Board of Directors. Key provisions of the
    stock incentive program are:

•

Authorized limit is 9,000,000 shares of common stock;

•

Prohibits the grant of a stock option with an exercise price
    that is less than the fair market value of the Company’s
    stock on the date of the grant; and

•

Imposes the following award limits to a single participant in a
    single calendar year, (1) options for more than
    500,000 shares of common stock; (2) stock awards for
    more than 150,000 shares of common stock;
    (3) performance share awards for more than
    300,000 shares of common stock (based on the maximum payout
    under the award); or (4) more than 1,000,000 performance
    units, which have a face amount of $1.00 each.

The Company records compensation expense at fair value over the
    vesting period for all awards it grants. In addition, the
    Company is required to record compensation expense at fair value
    (as previous awards continue to vest) for the unvested portion
    of previously granted stock option awards that were outstanding
    as of January 1, 2006. As of December 31, 2008, all
    such awards have been fully expensed.

Stock-based compensation for the reporting periods is as follows:

Options

Options are exercisable according to the terms of the individual
    stock option award agreements and expire 10 years after the

Stock
    Awards

Stock awards granted under the plan are restricted for varying
    periods, generally for three years. Participants have all rights
    of a shareholder with respect to a stock award, including the
    right to receive dividends and vote the shares. Prior to vesting
    in stock awards, the participant: (i) may not sell,
    transfer, pledge, exchange or otherwise dispose of shares;
    (ii) shall not retain custody of the share certificates;
    and (iii) will deliver to the Company a stock power with
    respect to each stock award.

The stock awards are recorded at cost that approximates fair
    value on the date of grant. The cost is amortized to
    compensation expense over the vesting period.

    usually three years. The Company accounts for performance share
    awards by accruing compensation expense over the vesting period
    based on: (i) the number of shares expected to be paid
    which is based on the probable achievement of performance
    objectives; and (ii) the closing stock price market value.
    The settlement of the award is at based on the closing price at
    the settlement date.

Sum of cash and stock settlements approximates the intrinsic
    value of the liability.

During the vesting period, the recipient of a performance share
    award has no shareholder rights. However, for performance shares
    granted in or before 2009, recipients will be paid an amount
    equal to the dividend equivalent on such shares. Performance
    shares granted in 2010 or later will not be entitled to dividend
    equivalent payments before the performance shares granted are
    earned and vested. Performance share awards are nontransferable
    and are subject to risk of forfeiture.
