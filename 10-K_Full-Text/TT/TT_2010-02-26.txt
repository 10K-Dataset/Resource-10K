PART I

Item 1

.

BUSINESS

Overview

Ingersoll-Rand plc (IR-Ireland), an Irish public limited
company, and its consolidated subsidiaries (we, our, the Company) is a diversified, global company that provides products, services and solutions to enhance the quality and comfort of air in homes and buildings, transport and protect food and
perishables, secure homes and commercial properties, and enhance industrial productivity and efficiency. Our business segments consist of Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies, each with strong
brands and leading positions within their respective markets. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sale and service of a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products that include well-recognized, premium
brand names such as Club Car

®

, Hussmann

®

, Ingersoll-Rand

®

,
Schlage

®

, Thermo King

®

and Trane

®

.

We are dedicated to inspiring progress for our customers, shareholders, employees and communities by achieving:

•

Dramatic Growth

, by focusing on innovative solutions for our customers;

•

Operational Excellence

, by pursuing continuous improvement in all of our operations; and

•

Dual Citizenship

, by bringing together the talents of all Ingersoll Rand people to leverage the capabilities of our global enterprise.

To achieve these goals and to become a more diversified company with strong growth prospects, we transformed our enterprise
portfolio by divesting cyclical, low-growth and asset-intensive businesses. In addition, our acquisition strategy has helped deliver more consistent revenue and earnings performance across all phases of the economic cycle. Aside from our portfolio
transformation, we continue to focus on increasing our recurring revenue stream, which includes revenues from parts, service, used equipment and rentals. We also intend to continuously improve the efficiencies, capabilities, products and services of
our high-potential businesses.

On July 1, 2009, Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited (IR-Limited), a Bermuda company, completed a
reorganization to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the parent company of Ingersoll Rand from Bermuda to Ireland. As a result, IR-Ireland replaced IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company effective July 1, 2009. All references
related to the Company prior to July 1, 2009 relate to IR-Limited.

Ireland Reorganization

On March 5, 2009, our board of directors approved a reorganization of the Company that would change the jurisdiction of incorporation of our parent
company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Ireland Reorganization). The first step in the Ireland Reorganization was the establishment of IR-Limited’s tax residency in Ireland, which occurred in March 2009. Subsequently, IR-Ireland replaced
IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Bermuda law (the Scheme of Arrangement). Major milestones to complete the Scheme of Arrangement were as follows:

•

On April 1, 2009, IR-Limited formed IR-Ireland as a direct subsidiary.

•

On April 20, 2009, IR-Limited petitioned the Supreme Court of Bermuda to order the calling of a meeting of the Class A common shareholders of
IR-Limited to approve the Scheme of Arrangement.

•

On April 23, 2009, the Supreme Court of Bermuda ordered IR-Limited to seek the approval of its Class A common shareholders on the Scheme of
Arrangement.



•

On June 3, 2009, IR-Limited received the requisite approval from its Class A common shareholders.

•

On June 11, 2009, the Supreme Court of Bermuda issued an order (the Sanction Order) approving the Scheme of Arrangement.

On June 30, 2009, IR-Limited filed the Sanction Order with the Bermuda Registrar of Companies and, at 12:01 a.m. on
July 1, 2009 (the Transaction Time) the following steps occurred simultaneously:

•

All fractional shares of IR-Limited held of record were cancelled and IR-Limited paid to each holder of fractional shares that were cancelled an amount
based on the average of the high and low trading prices of the IR-Limited Class A common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on June 29, 2009.

•

All previously outstanding whole Class A common shares of IR-Limited were cancelled.

•

IR-Limited issued to IR-Ireland 319,166,220 Class A common shares.

•

IR-Ireland issued 319,166,220 ordinary shares to holders of whole IR-Limited Class A common shares that were cancelled as a part of the Scheme of
Arrangement.

•

All previously outstanding ordinary shares of IR-Ireland held by IR-Limited and its nominees were acquired by IR-Ireland and cancelled for no
consideration.

As a result of the Ireland Reorganization, IR-Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of IR-Ireland and the
Class A common shareholders of IR-Limited became ordinary shareholders of IR-Ireland.

The Ireland Reorganization did not have a material
impact on our financial results. Ingersoll-Rand plc will still continue to be subject to United States Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements and prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). Shares of Ingersoll-Rand plc will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “IR”, the same symbol under which the Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited Class A common shares previously traded.

At the Transaction Time, IR-Limited completed the transfer of all the outstanding shares of Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited
(IR-Global) to Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited (IR-International), another wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited incorporated in Bermuda, whereupon IR-International assumed the obligations of IR-Limited as an issuer or
guarantor, as the case may be, under the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, medium-term notes and debentures. IR-Ireland and IR-Limited also fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment obligations of IR-International,
IR-Global and Ingersoll-Rand Company, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited incorporated in New Jersey (IR-New Jersey), as the case may be, as the issuers of debt securities under these indentures. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited has
issued or intends to issue guarantees in respect of any indebtedness incurred by Trane. In addition, any securities issued by the Company that were convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Class A common shares of IR-Limited became
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as the case may be, into the ordinary shares of IR-Ireland.

Bermuda Reorganization

IR-New Jersey, was organized in 1905 under the laws of the State of New Jersey as a consolidation of Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill Company and
the Rand Drill Company, whose businesses were established in the early 1870s.

IR-Limited was the successor to IR-New Jersey following a
corporate reorganization that became effective on December 31, 2001 (the Bermuda Reorganization). The Bermuda Reorganization was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control and accordingly, did not result in any changes
to the consolidated amounts of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity.



Recent Acquisitions and
Divestitures

On June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date), we completed our acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Trane
Inc. (Trane). Trane, previously named American Standard Companies Inc., provides systems and services that enhance the quality and comfort of the air in homes and buildings around the world. Trane’s systems and services have leading positions
in commercial, residential, institutional and industrial markets; a reputation for reliability, high quality and product innovation; and a powerful distribution network. The total cost of the acquisition was approximately $9.6 billion, which was
funded by a combination of cash on hand, commercial paper and a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility.

On November 30, 2007, we
completed the sale of our Bobcat, Utility Equipment and Attachments business units (collectively, Compact Equipment) to Doosan Infracore for cash proceeds of approximately $4.9 billion, subject to post-closing purchase price adjustments. Compact
Equipment manufactured and sold compact equipment including skid-steer loaders, compact track loaders, mini-excavators and telescopic tool handlers, portable air compressors, generators, light towers, general-purpose light construction equipment and
attachments. We are currently in the process of resolving the final purchase price adjustments with Doosan Infracore.

On April 30, 2007,
we completed the sale of our Road Development business unit to AB Volvo (publ) for cash proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. The Road Development business unit manufactured and sold asphalt paving equipment, compaction equipment, milling machines
and construction-related material handling equipment.

Business Segments

Our business segments provide products, services and solutions used to increase the efficiency and productivity of both industrial and commercial operations and homes, as well as improve the security,
safety, health and comfort of people around the world.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to more
closely reflect our corporate and business strategies and to promote additional productivity and growth. Our segments are now as follows: Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies. As part of the
change, we eliminated the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment which represented the acquired Trane business and created two new reportable segments, the Climate Solutions segment and the Residential Solutions segment. Our business segments
are as follows:

Climate Solutions

Our Climate Solutions segment delivers energy-efficient refrigeration and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) solutions throughout the world. Encompassing the transport and stationary refrigeration markets as well as the
commercial HVAC markets, this segment offers customers a broad range of products, services and solutions to manage controlled temperature environments. This segment, which had 2009 net revenues of $7.3 billion, includes the market leading brands of
Hussmann, Thermo King and Trane.

Residential Solutions

Our Residential Solutions segment provides safety, comfort and efficiency to homeowners throughout North America and parts of South America. It offers customers a broad range of products, services and
solutions including mechanical and electronic locks, energy-efficient HVAC systems, indoor air quality solutions, advanced controls, portable security systems and remote home management. This segment, which had 2009 net revenues of $2.0 billion, is
comprised of well-known brands like American Standard, Schlage and Trane.

Industrial Technologies

Our Industrial Technologies segment provides products, services and solutions that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. It offers our
global customers a diverse and innovative range of products including compressed air systems, tools, pumps, fluid handling systems, golf and utility vehicles in addition to environmentally friendly micro turbines. This segment, which had 2009 net
revenues of $2.2 billion, includes the Club Car and Ingersoll Rand market-leading brands.



Security Technologies

Our Security Technologies segment is a leading global provider of products and services that make environments safe, secure and productive.
The segment’s market-leading products include electronic and biometric access control systems and software, locks and locksets, door closers, exit devices, steel doors and frames, portable security devices, as well as time, attendance and
personnel scheduling systems. These products serve a wide range of markets including the commercial construction market, healthcare, retail, maritime and transport industries as well as educational and governmental facilities. This segment, which
had 2009 net revenues of $1.7 billion, includes the CISA, LCN, Schlage and Von Duprin brands.

Products

Our principal products by business segment include the following:



These products are sold primarily under our name and under other names including American Standard

®

, CISA

®

, Club Car

, Hussmann

, LCN

.

Competitive Conditions

Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Due to the diversity of these
products and the variety of markets served, we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line. They include well-established regional or specialized competitors, as well as larger U.S. and non-U.S. corporations or divisions of
larger companies.

The principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price, quality, delivery, service and support, technology
and innovation. We believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of HVAC systems and services, air compression systems, transport temperature control products, refrigerated display merchandisers, refrigeration systems and
controls, air tools, and golf and utility vehicles. In addition, we believe we are a leading supplier in U.S. markets for architectural hardware products, mechanical locks and electronic and biometric access-control technologies.

Distribution

Our products are distributed
by a number of methods, which we believe are appropriate to the type of product. U.S. sales are made through branch sales offices and through distributors, dealers and large retailers across the country. Non-U.S. sales are made through numerous
subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world.

Customers

We have no major customers that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues in 2009, 2008 or 2007. No material part of our business is
dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers; therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Raw Materials

We manufacture many of the components included in our products, which
requires us to employ a wide variety of raw materials. Principal raw materials, such as steel, copper and aluminum, are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world. In the past, higher prices for some raw materials,
particularly steel and non-ferrous metals, have caused pricing pressures in some of our businesses; we have historically been able to pass certain of these cost increases on to customers in the form of price increases.

We believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future. There have been no raw material shortages which have
had a material adverse effect on our businesses. However, significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins. To mitigate this potential impact, we enter into long-term supply contracts in
order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions.

Working Capital

We manufacture products that usually must be readily available to meet our customer’s rapid delivery requirements. Therefore, we maintain an adequate
level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements. Such working capital requirements are not, however, in the opinion of management, materially different from those experienced by our major competitors. Our
sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors.



Research and Development

We engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products, enhance existing products effectiveness, increase
safety, improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate. In addition, we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for
possible investment or acquisition. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position. Research and development expenditures,
including qualifying engineering costs, were $257.4 million in 2009, $204.6 million in 2008 and $128.6 million in 2007.

Patents and
Licenses

We own numerous patents and patent applications, and are licensed under others. Although in aggregate we consider our patents and
licenses to be valuable to our operations, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them. In our opinion, engineering, production skills and experience are more responsible for our
market position than our patents and/or licenses.

Operations by Geographic Area

More than 35% of our 2009 net revenues were derived outside the U.S. and we sold products in more than 100 countries. Therefore, the attendant risks of
manufacturing or selling in a particular country, such as nationalization and establishment of common markets, would not be expected to have a significant effect on our non-U.S. operations. For a discussion of risks attendant to our non-U.S.
operations, see “Risk Factors – Currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations may adversely affect our results,” “Risk Factors – Our global operations subject us to economic risks,” in Item 1A and
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk” in Item 7A.

Backlog

Our approximate backlog of orders, believed to be firm, at December 31, 2009 and 2008, were as follows:

These backlog figures are based on orders received. While the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock, orders for specialized machinery or
specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision, deferral, cancellation or termination. We expect to ship substantially the entire backlog at December 31, 2009 during 2010.

Environmental Matters

We continue to be
dedicated to an environmental program intended to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in
site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities.

We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state authorities. We have been also
identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, our involvement is
minimal.

In estimating our liability, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of
other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based generally on the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits
and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future.



During 2009, we spent $10.8
million for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of $93.3 million and $100.9 million, respectively. We believe that
these expenditures and accrual levels will continue and may increase over time. Given the evolving nature of environmental laws, regulations and technology, the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain.

For a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities, see also Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, Environmental and Asbestos Matters and also Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

Asbestos Matters

Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in
state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims has been filed against either IR-New Jersey or Trane and generally allege injury caused
by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by IR-New Jersey or Trane, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. Neither IR-New Jersey nor Trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos, however, some formerly
manufactured products utilized asbestos-containing components such as gaskets and packings purchased from third- party suppliers.

See also
the discussion under Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Environmental and Asbestos Matters and also Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

Employees

As a result of the acquisition
of Trane in the second quarter of 2008, we increased our workforce by approximately 30,000 people. As of December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 57,000 people throughout the world.

Item 1A

.

RISK FACTORS

The following are certain risk
factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves
some risks, including the risks described below. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline, and
you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Relating to Our Businesses

We are relying on an indemnification agreement with respect to any potential liability arising from a European Commission Investigation into possible
infringement of European Union competition law by Trane and its subsidiaries. If we were unable to rely on the indemnification agreement for any reason, any potential liability arising from the European Commission Investigation could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

In connection with Trane’s spinoff of the Vehicle Control
Systems business into a new publicly traded company called WABCO Holdings Inc. (WABCO) on July 31, 2007, Trane entered into an Indemnification and Cooperation Agreement (Indemnification Agreement) with, among others, American Standard Europe
BVBA (renamed WABCO Europe BVBA) (WABCO Europe), which became a subsidiary of WABCO following the spinoff. Pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement, WABCO Europe has agreed to indemnify Trane and its subsidiaries and their respective affiliates
against any fines related to the European Commission Investigation. For a further discussion of European Commission Investigation, see “Legal Proceedings.” If the maximum fine is levied in 2010, the total liability could be as high as $1.1
billion based on Trane’s last full fiscal year of worldwide revenue attributable to all of its product lines owned at the time the Statement of Objections was issued, subject to a probable reduction for leniency of at least 20 percent provided
WABCO Europe, as the leniency applicant, fulfilled all conditions set forth in the European Commission’s leniency notice. WABCO has stated in its Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009 that its ability to satisfy its
obligations under the Indemnification Agreement is contingent on its funding capability at the time of the fine, which could be affected by, among other things, its ability to access its then existing credit facilities, its ability to obtain
alternative sources of financing, its ability to obtain some payment relief from the European Commission or its ability to obtain a suspension of the payment obligation from the European Court of First Instance. If WABCO Europe were unable to
satisfy its obligations under the Indemnification Agreement or if we were unable to rely on the Indemnification Agreement for any reason, any potential liability arising from the European Commission Investigation could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition and results of operations.

We face continuing risks relating to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA)

On November 10, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order directing that a number
of public companies, including us, provide information relating to their participation in certain transactions under the United Nations’ Oil for Food Program. Upon receipt of the Order, we undertook a thorough review of our participation in the
Oil for Food Program and provided the SEC with information responsive to its investigation of our participation in the program. On October 31, 2007, we announced that we had reached settlements with the SEC and the Department of Justice (DOJ)
relating to certain payments made by our foreign subsidiaries in 2000-2003 in connection with the Oil for Food Program. Pursuant to the settlements with the SEC and DOJ, we have, among other things, (i) consented to the entry of a civil
injunction in the SEC action, (ii) entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the DOJ, and (iii) agreed to implement improvements to our compliance program designed to enhance detection and prevention of violations
of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. If the DOJ determines, in its sole discretion, that we have committed a federal



crime or have otherwise breached the DPA during its three-year term, we may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the DOJ has knowledge, including, without
limitation, violations of the FCPA in connection with the Oil for Food Program. Breaches of the settlements with SEC and DOJ may also subject us to, among other things, further enforcement actions by the SEC or the DOJ, securities litigation and a
general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the market value of our stock. For a further discussion of the settlements with the SEC and DOJ, see “Legal Proceedings.”

Furthermore, we have reported to the DOJ and SEC certain matters involving Trane, including one relating to the Oil for Food Program, and which raise
potential issues under the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. With respect to these matters, we have conducted a thorough investigation which began in earnest promptly after our acquisition of Trane in June 2008. Previously, we had
reported to the SEC and DOJ potential FCPA issues relating to one of our businesses in China, and we have reported back to them and shared with them our audit report, which indicated no FCPA violations. With respect to that same business in China,
we have discussed with the DOJ and SEC another matter which raises potential FCPA issues. We have had preliminary discussions concerning the foregoing with the SEC and DOJ, to be followed by further discussions about them and possibly other matters
which raise potential FCPA concerns. These matters (and others which may arise or of which we become aware in the future) may be deemed to violate the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Such determinations could subject us to, among
other things, further enforcement actions by the SEC or the DOJ (if, for example, the DOJ deems us to have violated the DPA), securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business
prospects and the market value of our stock.

Our global operations subject us to economic risks.

Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including Europe, China, Brazil,
Venezuela, Africa, India and Turkey. These activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally, including the following:

•

countries could change regulations or impose currency restrictions and other restraints;

•

in some countries, there is a risk that the government may expropriate assets;

•

some countries impose burdensome tariffs and quotas;

•

national and international conflict, including terrorist acts, could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations; and

•

economic downturns, political instability and war or civil disturbances may disrupt production and distribution logistics or limit sales in individual
markets.

Currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and
interest rates. See Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

More than 35% of our 2009 net
revenues were derived outside the U.S., and we expect sales to non-U.S. customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues. Although we enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to
currency exchange fluctuations, changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our results of operations. Because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure,
our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations.



Furthermore, the reporting
currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. We have assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial
statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.

We are also a large buyer of steel and non-ferrous metals, as
well as other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We may purchase commodity derivatives which reduce the volatility of the commodity prices for supplier contracts where fixed pricing is not available.

Significant shortages in the raw materials we use in our businesses and higher energy prices could increase our operating costs.

We rely on suppliers to secure raw materials, particularly steel and non-ferrous metals, required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in
deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that available sources of supply
will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Additionally, we are exposed to large fluctuations for the price of petroleum-based fuel due to the instability of current market prices. Higher energy
costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products to customers around the world. Consequently, sharp price increases, the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply, could cause us to lose the ability to effectively
manage the risk of rising fuel prices and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Changes in
weather patterns and seasonal fluctuations may adversely affect certain segments of the Company’s business and impact overall results of operations.

Demand for certain segments of the Company’s products and services is influenced by weather conditions. For instance, Trane’s sales have historically tended to be seasonally higher in the second
and third quarters of the year because, in the U.S. and other northern hemisphere markets, summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services. Additionally, while there is demand for Trane’s products and services
throughout the year, a significant percentage of total sales are related to U.S. residential and commercial construction activity, which is generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year. Therefore, results of any quarterly period may
not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of the Company’s business and impact overall results of
operations.

Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health.

We estimate that our available cash and our cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. In
making this estimate, we have not assumed the need to make any material payments in connection with any pending litigation or investigations. As required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we establish reserves based
on our assessment of contingencies. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings, including current or future asbestos-related litigation, may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required
to make additional material payments, which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations.



Such an outcome could have
important consequences. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;

•

restrict our ability to exploit business opportunities; and

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness.

If the distribution of WABCO’s shares by Trane on July 31, 2007 were to fail to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes
under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), then Trane and Trane’s shareholders who received WABCO common stock in the distribution may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes.

On July 31, 2007, Trane (then known as American Standard Companies Inc.) completed the spinoff of its vehicle control systems business into a new
publicly traded company named WABCO. At the time, Trane received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) substantially to the effect that the distribution qualified as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under
Section 355 of the Code. In addition, Trane received an opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, tax counsel to Trane, substantially to the effect that the distribution will qualify as tax-free to Trane, WABCO and Trane
shareholders under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code. The ruling and opinion were based on, among other things, certain assumptions as well as on the accuracy of certain factual representations and statements made by WABCO and
Trane. In rendering its ruling, the IRS also relied on certain covenants that Trane and WABCO entered into, including the adherence to certain restrictions on WABCO’s and Trane’s future actions.

In connection with our acquisition of Trane in June 2008, we received an opinion of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, tax counsel to us,
substantially to the effect that the distribution should continue to qualify as tax-free to Trane, WABCO and Trane shareholders under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code. Notwithstanding receipt by Trane and us of the private letter
ruling as well as the opinions of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not later assert that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction.

If the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, then Trane would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of WABCO’s common stock distributed
to the Trane shareholders over (ii) Trane’s tax basis in such common stock. Under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the distribution were to fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization and such failure was not the
result of actions taken after the distribution by Trane or any of its subsidiaries or shareholders, WABCO would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Trane as a result thereof. In addition, each Trane shareholder who received WABCO common stock in
the distribution generally would be treated as having received a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of WABCO’s common stock received (including any fractional share sold on behalf of the shareholder), which would
be taxable as a dividend to the extent of the shareholder’s ratable share of Trane’s current and accumulated earnings and profits at the time (as increased to reflect any current income including any gain recognized by Trane on the taxable
distribution). The balance, if any, of the distribution would be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the Trane shareholder’s tax basis in its Trane stock, with any remaining amount being taxed as capital gain. If WABCO
was unable to satisfy its obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement or if Trane was unable to rely on the Tax Sharing Agreement for any reason, any potential liability arising from the distribution of WABCO’s shares by Trane could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.



Risks Relating to Our Past
Reorganizations

We effected a corporate reorganization in December 2001 to become a Bermuda company (the “Bermuda
Reorganization”) and a subsequent corporate reorganization in July 2009 to become an Irish public limited company (the “Ireland Reorganization”). These reorganizations exposed us and our shareholders to the risks described below. In
addition, we cannot be assured that all of the anticipated benefits of the reorganizations will be realized.

Changes in tax laws,
regulations or treaties, changes in our status under U.S. or other tax laws or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results, as well as subject our
shareholders to additional taxes.

The realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations could be impacted by changes in
tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the U.S. tax authorities or any other tax authority. From time to time, proposals have been made and/or legislation has been introduced to change the U.S. tax
law that if enacted could increase our tax burden and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, recent legislative proposals would broaden the circumstances under which we would be
considered a U.S. resident, which would significantly diminish the realization of any tax benefit related to our reorganizations. There are other recent U.S. tax legislative proposals that could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various
currently deductible payments, which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position. Moreover, other legislative proposals could potentially affect us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty
benefits on certain payments by our U.S. subsidiaries to our non-U.S. affiliates, which would adversely affect our effective tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation. While we are currently monitoring these proposals and
are investigating all options, we could still be subject to increased U.S. taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted and/or certain tax treaties are amended.

While our U.S. operations are subject to U.S. tax, we believe that a significant portion of our non-U.S. operations are generally not subject to U.S. tax
other than withholding taxes. Our conclusions are based on, among other things, our determination that we, and a significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries, are not currently controlled foreign corporation’s (CFC) within the meaning of the
U.S. tax laws, although the IRS or a court may not concur with our conclusions. A non-U.S. corporation, such as us, will constitute a CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if certain ownership criteria are met. If the IRS or a court determined
that we (or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries) were a CFC, then each of our U.S. shareholders who own (directly, indirectly, or constructively) 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock (or the stock of any of our
non-U.S. subsidiaries) on the last day of the applicable taxable year (a “10% U.S. Voting Shareholder”) would be required to include in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of our subpart F and other similar
types of income (and the subpart F and other similar types of income of any of our subsidiaries determined to be a CFC) for the period during which we (and our non-U.S. subsidiaries) were a CFC. In addition, gain on the sale of our shares realized
by such a shareholder may be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder’s proportionate share of our and our CFC subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings and profits accumulated during the shareholder’s holding period of
the shares while we (or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries) are a CFC. Treatment of us or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as a CFC could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

On July 20, 2007, we received a notice from the IRS containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002
tax years. The IRS did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in Bermuda. The most significant adjustments proposed by the IRS involve treating the entire intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in Bermuda as
equity. As a result of this recharacterization, the IRS disallowed the deduction of interest paid on the debt and imposed dividend withholding taxes on the payments denominated as interest. The IRS also asserted an alternative argument to be applied
if the intercompany debt is respected as debt. In that circumstance, the IRS proposed to ignore the entities that hold the debt and to which the interest was paid, and impose 30% withholding tax on a portion of the interest



payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced U.S. withholding tax under a U.S. income tax treaty. The IRS asserted under this alternative theory that we
owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately $84 million plus interest. If either of these positions were upheld in their entirety, we would be required to record additional charges. We strongly disagreed with the view of the IRS, and
filed a protest with the IRS in the third quarter of 2007.

On January 12, 2010, we received an amended notice from the IRS eliminating
its assertion that the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in Bermuda should be treated as equity. However, the IRS continues to assert the alternative position described above and proposes adjustments to our 2001 and
2002 tax filings. In addition, the IRS provided notice on January 19, 2010, that it is assessing penalties of 30% on the asserted underpayment of tax described above.

We have and intend to continue to vigorously contest these proposed adjustments. We, in consultation with our outside advisors, carefully considered the form and substance of our intercompany financing
arrangements, including the actions necessary to qualify for the benefits of the applicable U.S. income tax treaties. We believe that these financing arrangements are in accordance with the laws of the relevant jurisdictions including the U.S., that
the entities involved should be respected and that the interest payments qualify for the U.S. income tax treaty benefits claimed.

Although
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based upon an analysis of the strength of our position, we believe that we are adequately reserved for this matter. As we move forward to resolve this matter with the IRS, it is
reasonably possible that the reserves established may be adjusted. However, we do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial position. At this time, the IRS has not
proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2002. However, if all or a portion of these adjustments proposed by the IRS are ultimately sustained, it is likely to also affect subsequent tax years. For a further discussion of the IRS
audit, see “Legal Proceedings” and Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements.

As noted above, the IRS did not contest the
validity of the Bermuda Reorganization in the above-mentioned notices. We believe that neither we nor our consolidated subsidiary IR-New Jersey will incur significant U.S. federal income or withholding taxes as a result of the transfer of the shares
of our subsidiaries that occurred as part of the Bermuda Reorganization. However, we cannot give any assurances that the IRS will agree with our determination.

The inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our reorganizations could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us.

Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the U.S. tax authorities or any other tax authority.
From time to time, proposals have been made and/or legislation has been introduced to change the U.S. tax law that if enacted could increase our tax burden and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of
operations. For example, the Obama administration has recently announced various tax legislative proposals that, if adopted, could adversely impact the Company. Legislative action may be taken by the U.S. Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could
potentially override U.S. tax treaties upon which we rely, broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a U.S. resident or modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments, each of which could
materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. However, if these or similar proposals that had the effect of disregarding the Ireland Reorganization,
limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions (including the United States) or modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments were enacted, we could be subjected
to increased taxation. In addition, any future amendments to current income tax treaties, including between Ireland and other jurisdictions (including the United States) could subject us to increased taxation.



Also, the U.S. federal
government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to U.S. companies that reincorporate outside of the U.S. or have reincorporated outside of the U.S.

For instance, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended, includes a provision that prohibits “inverted domestic corporations” and their
subsidiaries from entering into contracts with the Department of Homeland Security. In addition, the State of California adopted legislation intended to limit the eligibility of certain non-U.S. chartered companies to participate in certain state
contracts. More recently, the 2008, 2009 and 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Acts prohibit any federal government agency from using funds appropriated by Congress for fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010 to pay an inverted domestic corporation or any
of its subsidiaries for work performed or products provided under certain federal contracts (“Affected Contracts”). Although the amount of monies already paid to us or to be paid to us under the Affected Contracts is not material to the
Company, we cannot provide any assurance that the impact of future actions taken by the government in this area will not be materially adverse to our operations.

In addition, there continues to be negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, companies that conduct business in the United States and in other countries but have changed their place of incorporation
to another country.

Our effective tax rate may increase notwithstanding the Ireland Reorganization.

While the Ireland Reorganization is not anticipated to have any material impact on our effective tax rate, there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies
of the jurisdictions where we operate (which include the potential legislative actions described above), and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions
could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate.

Dividends received by our
shareholders may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.

In certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, we are
required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 20%) from dividends paid to our shareholders. In the majority of cases, shareholders resident in the United States will not be subject to Irish withholding tax, and
shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to Irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax forms. However, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could
adversely affect the price of our shares.

Dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to Irish income tax.

Dividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these
dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax, unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Ingersoll Rand.

Our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the
dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Ingersoll Rand.

A future transfer of our shares may be
subject to Irish stamp duty.

In certain circumstances, the transfer of shares in an Irish incorporated company will be subject to
Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired) payable by the buyer. Although in the majority of transactions there will be no stamp duty because both the seller and buyer
hold the shares beneficially, this additional risk for the buyer could adversely affect the price of our shares. Although we currently intend to cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share



transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially, our articles of association provide that, in the
event of any such payment, we (i) may seek reimbursement from the transferor or transferee (at our discretion), (ii) may set-off the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends payable to the transferor or transferee (at our
discretion), and (iii) will have a lien against our shares on which we have paid stamp duty and any dividends paid on such shares.

Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether
the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those
persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment
for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.

As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations
and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only.
Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our
securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

In addition, Irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval. Also, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants
statutory pre-emptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory pre-emptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares. These
authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the normal course of business, we are involved in a variety of lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, including commercial and contract
disputes, employment matters, product liability claims, environmental liabilities and intellectual property disputes. In our opinion, pending legal matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations,
financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.

Oil for Food Program and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) matters

As previously reported, on November 10, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order directing that a number of public companies,
including the Company, provide information relating to their participation in transactions under the United Nations’ Oil for Food Program. Upon receipt of the Order, the Company undertook a thorough review of its participation in the Oil for
Food Program, provided the SEC with information responsive to the Order and provided additional information requested by the SEC. During a March 27, 2007 meeting with the SEC, at which a representative of the Department of Justice (DOJ) was
also present, the Company began discussions concerning the resolution of this matter with both the SEC and DOJ. On October 31, 2007, the Company announced it had reached settlements with the SEC and DOJ relating to this matter. Under the terms
of the settlements, the Company paid a total of $6.7 million in penalties, interest and disgorgement of profits. The Company has consented to the entry of a civil injunction in the SEC action and has entered into a three-year deferred prosecution
agreement (DPA) with the DOJ. Under both settlements, the Company has implemented and will continue to implement improvements to its compliance program that are consistent with its longstanding policy against improper payments. In the settlement
documents, the Government noted that the Company thoroughly cooperated with the investigation, that the Company had conducted its own complete investigation of the conduct at issue, promptly and thoroughly reported its findings to them, and took
prompt remedial measures.

Additionally, we have reported to the DOJ and SEC certain matters involving Trane, including one relating to the
Oil for Food Program, and which raise potential issues under the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. With respect to these matters, we have conducted a thorough investigation, which began in earnest promptly after our acquisition of
Trane in June 2008. Previously, we had reported to the SEC and DOJ potential FCPA issues relating to one of our businesses in China, and we have reported back to them and shared our audit report, which indicated no FCPA violations. With respect to
that same business in China, we have discussed with the DOJ and SEC another matter which raises potential FCPA issues. We have had preliminary discussions concerning the foregoing with the SEC and DOJ, to be followed by further discussions about
them and possibly other matters which raise potential FCPA concerns. These matters (and others which may arise or of which we become aware in the future) may be deemed to violate the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Such
determinations could subject us to, among other things, further enforcement actions by the SEC or the DOJ (if, for example, the DOJ deems us to have violated the DPA), securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which
could adversely affect our business prospects and the market value of our stock.



The European Commission
Investigation

In November 2004, Trane was contacted by the European Commission as part of a multi-company investigation into possible
infringement of European Union competition law relating to the distribution of bathroom fixtures and fittings in certain European countries. On March 28, 2007, Trane, along with a number of other companies, received a Statement of Objections
from the European Commission. The Statement of Objections, an administrative complaint, alleges infringements of European Union competition rules by numerous bathroom fixture and fittings companies, including Trane and certain of its former European
subsidiaries engaged in the Bath and Kitchen business. These former subsidiaries were transferred (i) to WABCO on July 31, 2007 as part of a legal reorganization in connection with the spinoff of Trane’s Vehicle Control Systems
business and (ii) to Bain Capital Partners LLC on October 31, 2007 in connection with the sale of Trane’s Bath & Kitchen business. Trane and certain of its former European subsidiaries will be jointly and severally liable for
any fines that result from the investigation. However, pursuant to an Indemnification and Cooperation Agreement among Trane and certain other parties (Indemnification Agreement), American Standard Europe BVBA (renamed WABCO Europe BVBA) (WABCO
Europe), which is a subsidiary of WABCO following the reorganization, will be responsible for, and will indemnify Trane and its subsidiaries (including certain subsidiaries formerly engaged in the Bath and Kitchen business) and their respective
affiliates against, any fines related to this investigation. Trane and the charged subsidiaries responded to the European Commission on August 1, 2007 and July 31, 2007, respectively. A hearing with the European Commission regarding the
response to the Statement of Objections was conducted from November 12-14, 2007, in Brussels. WABCO Europe and other former Trane subsidiaries participated in the hearing. Trane, however, did not participate in the hearing.

In 2006, the European Commission adopted new fining guidelines (2006 Guidelines) and stated its intention to apply these guidelines in all cases in which a
Statement of Objections is issued after September 2006. In applying the 2006 Guidelines, the Commission retains considerable discretion in calculating the fine although the European Union regulations provide for a cap on the maximum fine equal to
ten percent of Trane’s worldwide revenue attributable to all of its products for the fiscal year prior to the year in which the fine is imposed. If the maximum fine is levied in 2010, the total liability could be as high as $1.1 billion based
on Trane’s last full fiscal year of worldwide revenue attributable to all of its businesses owned at the time the Statement of Objections was issued, subject to a probable reduction for leniency of at least 20 percent provided WABCO Europe, as
the leniency applicant, fulfilled all conditions set forth in the European Commission’s leniency notice. WABCO has stated in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, that its ability to satisfy its obligations under
the Indemnification Agreement is contingent on its funding capability at the time of the fine, which could be affected by, among other things, its ability to access its then existing credit facilities, its ability to obtain alternative sources of
financing, its ability to obtain some payment relief from the European Commission or its ability to obtain a suspension of the payment obligation from the European Court of First Instance.

Tax Related Matters

On July 20, 2007,
we received a notice from the IRS containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years. The IRS did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in Bermuda. The most significant adjustments
proposed by the IRS involve treating the entire intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in Bermuda as equity. As a result of this recharacterization, the IRS disallowed the deduction of interest paid on the debt and imposed
dividend withholding taxes on the payments denominated as interest. The IRS also asserted an alternative argument to be applied if the intercompany debt is respected as debt. In that circumstance, the IRS proposed to ignore the entities that hold
the debt and to which the interest was paid, and impose 30% withholding tax on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced U.S. withholding tax under a U.S. income tax treaty. The
IRS asserted under this alternative theory that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately $84 million plus interest. If either of these positions were upheld in their entirety, we would be required to record additional charges.
We strongly disagreed with the view of the IRS, and filed a protest with the IRS in the third quarter of 2007.



On January 12, 2010, we
received an amended notice from the IRS eliminating its assertion that the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in Bermuda should be treated as equity. However, the IRS continues to assert the alternative position
described above and proposes adjustments to our 2001 and 2002 tax filings. In addition, the IRS provided notice on January 19, 2010, that it is assessing penalties of 30% on the asserted underpayment of tax described above.

We have and intend to continue to vigorously contest these proposed adjustments. We, in consultation with our outside advisors, carefully considered the
form and substance of our intercompany financing arrangements, including the actions necessary to qualify for the benefits of the applicable U.S. income tax treaties. We believe that these financing arrangements are in accordance with the laws of
the relevant jurisdictions including the U.S., that the entities involved should be respected and that the interest payments qualify for the U.S. income tax treaty benefits claimed.

Although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based upon an analysis of the strength of our position, we believe that we are adequately reserved for this matter. As we move
forward to resolve this matter with the IRS, it is reasonably possible that the reserves established may be adjusted. However, we do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or
financial position. At this time, the IRS has not proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2002. However, if all or a portion of these adjustments proposed by the IRS are ultimately sustained, it is likely to also affect subsequent
tax years. For a further discussion of tax matters, see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

Asbestos Related Matters

Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In
virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims has been filed against either Ingersoll Rand Company (IR-New Jersey) or Trane and generally allege injury caused by
exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by IR-New Jersey or Trane, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. Neither IR-New Jersey nor Trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos, however, some formerly
manufactured products utilized asbestos-containing components such as gaskets and packings purchased from third-party suppliers.

PART II

Item 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER

MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Information regarding the principal market for our ordinary shares and related shareholder matters is as follows:

Our ordinary shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol IR. As of February 18, 2010, the approximate number of record holders of
ordinary shares was 5,521. The high and low sales price per share and the dividend paid per share for the following periods were as follows:

The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 358015, New York, NY 15252-8015, (800) 507-9357) is our transfer agent, registrar and dividend reinvestment agent.

Future dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of
operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, as well as our ability to pay dividends in compliance with the Irish Companies Act. Under the
Irish Companies Act, dividends and distributions may only be made from distributable reserves. Distributable reserves, broadly, means the accumulated realized profits of IR-Ireland. In addition, no distribution or dividend may be made unless the net
assets of IR-Ireland are equal to, or in excess of, the aggregate of IR-Ireland’s called up share capital plus undistributable reserves and the distribution does not reduce IR-Ireland’s net assets below such aggregate.

Information regarding equity compensation plans required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item is incorporated by reference from our definite Proxy
Statement for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.

We treat ordinary shares of our parent owned by a subsidiary as treasury stock.
These shares are recorded at cost and included in the Shareholders’ equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2007, Class A common shares of IR-Limited owned by the Company amounted to 97.4 million. As a result
of the acquisition of Trane in June 2008, the Company issued 45.4 million IR-Limited Class A common shares to fund the equity portion of the consideration. In June 2009, IR-Limited cancelled the remaining 52.0 million shares in
anticipation of the Ireland Reorganization that became effective on July 1, 2009.



Total share repurchases for the
year ended December 31, 2009 are as follows:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Overview

Organization

Ingersoll-Rand plc (IR-Ireland), an Irish public limited company, and its consolidated subsidiaries (we, our, the
Company) is a diversified, global company that provides products, services and solutions to enhance the quality and comfort of air in homes and buildings, transport and protect food and perishables, secure homes and commercial properties, and
increase industrial productivity and efficiency. Our business segments consist of Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies, each with strong brands and leading positions within their respective
markets. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sale and service of a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products that include well-recognized, premium brand names such as Club Car

®

, Hussmann

®

, Ingersoll-Rand

®

,
Schlage

®

, Thermo King

®

and Trane

®

.

We are dedicated to inspiring progress for our customers, shareholders, employees and communities by achieving:

•

Dramatic Growth

, by focusing on innovative solutions for our customers;

•

Operational Excellence

, by pursuing continuous improvement in all of our operations; and

•

Dual Citizenship

, by bringing together the talents of all Ingersoll Rand people to leverage the capabilities of our global enterprise.

To achieve these goals and to become a more diversified company with strong growth prospects, we transformed our enterprise
portfolio by divesting cyclical, low-growth and asset-intensive businesses. In addition, our acquisition strategy has helped deliver more consistent revenue and earnings performance across all phases of the economic cycle. Aside from our portfolio
transformation, we continue to focus on increasing our recurring revenue stream, which includes revenues from parts, service, used equipment and rentals. We also intend to continuously improve the efficiencies, capabilities, products and services of
our high-potential businesses.

On July 1, 2009, Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited (IR-Limited), a Bermuda company, completed a
reorganization to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the parent company of Ingersoll Rand from Bermuda to Ireland. As a result, IR-Ireland replaced IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company effective July 1, 2009. All references
related to the Company prior to July 1, 2009 relate to IR-Limited.

Ireland Reorganization

On March 5, 2009, our board of directors approved a reorganization of the Company that would change the jurisdiction of incorporation of our parent
company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Ireland Reorganization). The first step in the Ireland Reorganization was the establishment of IR-Limited’s tax residency in Ireland, which occurred in March 2009. Subsequently, IR-Ireland replaced
IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Bermuda law (the Scheme of Arrangement). Major milestones to complete the Scheme of Arrangement were as follows:

•

On April 1, 2009, IR-Limited formed IR-Ireland as a direct subsidiary.



•

On April 20, 2009, IR-Limited petitioned the Supreme Court of Bermuda to order the calling of a meeting of the Class A common shareholders of
IR-Limited to approve the Scheme of Arrangement.

•

On April 23, 2009, the Supreme Court of Bermuda ordered IR-Limited to seek the approval of its Class A common shareholders on the Scheme of
Arrangement.

•

On June 3, 2009, IR-Limited received the requisite approval from its Class A common shareholders.

•

On June 11, 2009, the Supreme Court of Bermuda issued an order (the Sanction Order) approving the Scheme of Arrangement.

On June 30, 2009, IR-Limited filed the Sanction Order with the Bermuda Registrar of Companies and, at 12:01 a.m. on
July 1, 2009 (the Transaction Time) the following steps occurred simultaneously:

•

All fractional shares of IR-Limited held of record were cancelled and IR-Limited paid to each holder of fractional shares that were cancelled an amount
based on the average of the high and low trading prices of the IR-Limited Class A common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on June 29, 2009.

•

All previously outstanding whole Class A common shares of IR-Limited were cancelled.

•

IR-Limited issued to IR-Ireland 319,166,220 Class A common shares.

•

IR-Ireland issued 319,166,220 ordinary shares to holders of whole IR-Limited Class A common shares that were cancelled as a part of the Scheme of
Arrangement.

•

All previously outstanding ordinary shares of IR-Ireland held by IR-Limited and its nominees were acquired by IR-Ireland and cancelled for no
consideration.

As a result of the Ireland Reorganization, IR-Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of IR-Ireland and the
Class A common shareholders of IR-Limited became ordinary shareholders of IR-Ireland.

The Ireland Reorganization did not have a material
impact on our financial results. Ingersoll-Rand plc will still continue to be subject to United States Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements and prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles. Shares of Ingersoll-Rand plc will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “IR”, the same symbol under which the Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited Class A common shares previously traded.

At the Transaction Time, IR-Limited completed the transfer of all the outstanding shares of Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global) to
Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited (IR-International), another wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited incorporated in Bermuda, whereupon IR-International assumed the obligations of IR-Limited as an issuer or guarantor, as the case
may be, under the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, medium-term notes and debentures. IR-Ireland and IR-Limited also fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment obligations of IR-International, IR-Global and
Ingersoll-Rand Company, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited incorporated in New Jersey (IR-New Jersey), as the case may be, as the issuers of debt securities under these indentures. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited has issued or
intends to issue guarantees in respect of any indebtedness incurred by Trane. In addition, any securities issued by the Company that were convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Class A common shares of IR-Limited became convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable, as the case may be, into the ordinary shares of IR-Ireland.

On July 1, 2009, IR-Global amended and restated
its commercial paper program (the Commercial Paper Program) pursuant to which IR-Global may issue, on a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.25 billion. Under the
Commercial Paper Program, IR-Global may issue notes from time to time, and the proceeds of the financing will be used for general corporate purposes. Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International has provided an irrevocable and



unconditional guarantee for the notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program. Pursuant to the terms of our credit facility entered into on August 12, 2005 and our credit facility entered
into on June 27, 2008 (the Credit Facilities), at the Transaction Time, IR-Ireland and IR-International became guarantors to such Credit Facilities. In connection therewith, IR-Ireland and IR-International entered into Addendums on July 1,
2009 to become parties to the Credit Facilities.

In connection with the Transaction, effective as of the Transaction Time, IR-Ireland assumed
the existing obligations of IR-Limited under the equity incentive plans and other similar employee award plans of Ingersoll Rand (collectively, the Plans), including all awards issued thereunder. Furthermore, the Plans have been amended to provide
(1) that ordinary shares of IR-Ireland will be issued, held available or used to measure benefits as appropriate under the Plans, in lieu of shares of IR-Limited, including upon exercise of any options or share appreciation rights or upon the
vesting of restricted stock units or performance units issued under those Plans; and (2) for the appropriate substitution of IR-Ireland for IR-Limited in those Plans.

Trends and Economic Events

We are a global corporation with worldwide operations.
As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, as well as political factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of our
product sales and services, has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results.

Since the onset of the economic downturn in 2008, we have seen weaker demand for many of our products and services. Although the challenging and difficult end market environments in which we operate are
showing signs of stabilization, albeit at lower levels, we are still operating in a depressed economic climate.

Despite the challenging
economic environment, we continue to execute our business strategy. The divestiture of both Compact Equipment and the Road Development business unit in 2007, in addition to the acquisition of Trane in 2008, have enabled us to become more balanced
across the products we offer. In addition, our current enterprise-wide restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008 are designed to streamline the footprint of our manufacturing facilities and reduce our general and administrative
cost base.

Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served, management uses a variety of factors to predict the
outlook for the Company. We monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance.
In those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in
the economy.

For 2010, we expect current market conditions to continue to impact our financial results. U.S. and European non-residential
construction markets are expected to remain weak; however, some of our end markets are showing signs of stabilization.

Despite the current
market environment, we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines. Our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities
within our service, parts and replacement revenue streams. In addition, we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which will fuel our future growth.

Acquisition of Trane

At the close
of business on June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Trane. Trane, previously named American Standard Companies Inc., provides systems and services that enhance the quality
and comfort of the air in homes and buildings around the world.



Trane’s systems and services have leading positions in premium commercial, residential, institutional and industrial markets, a reputation for reliability, high quality and product
innovation and a powerful distribution network. Trane’s 2007 annual revenues were $7.5 billion.

We paid a combination of (i) 0.23
of an IR-Limited Class A common share and (ii) $36.50 in cash, without interest, for each outstanding share of Trane common stock. The total cost of the acquisition was approximately $9.6 billion, including change in control payments and
direct costs of the transaction. We financed the cash portion of the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, commercial paper and a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility.

The components of the purchase price were as follows:

As a result of the acquisition, the results of the operations of Trane have been included in the statement of financial position at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the full
year of 2009 and since the Acquisition Date in 2008. For further details on the acquisition of Trane, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Significant events in 2009

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external
reporting structure to more closely reflect our corporate and business strategies and to promote additional productivity and growth. Our segments are now as follows: Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security
Technologies. As part of the change, we eliminated the Air Conditioning Systems and services segment which represented the acquired Trane business and created two new reportable segments, the Climate Solutions segment and the Residential Solutions
segment. See Note 24 in the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the segment realignment.

During 2009, we completed
a comprehensive financing program that significantly enhanced our liquidity and debt profile. Actions taken include the issuance of $1.0 billion in long-term debt (Senior Notes and Exchangeable Senior Notes) in April 2009 and the replacement of our
Trane accounts receivable purchase program in March 2009 with a new accounts receivable purchase program that encompassed originators from all four of our business segments. The proceeds from our debt issuance were used to repay the $950.0 million
outstanding under our senior unsecured bridge loan facility.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated enterprise-wide restructuring
actions in order to streamline both our manufacturing footprint and our general and administrative cost base. We have incurred approximately $182.1 million of costs associated with our restructuring programs since the fourth quarter of 2008, $111.4
million of which occurred during 2009. These combined restructuring actions generated approximately $194 million of annual pretax savings for 2009.

Significant events in 2008

As discussed in Acquisition of Trane above, on June 5, 2008, we acquired 100% of the
outstanding common shares of Trane for approximately $9.6 billion.



In August 2008, we filed a
universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance and issued $1.6 billion of long-term debt pursuant to the shelf registration statement. This
issuance consisted of $250 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due in 2010, $600 million 6.000% Senior Notes due in 2013 and $750 million 6.875% Senior Notes due in 2018. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited, which
directly owns 100% of the subsidiary issuer, IR Global Holding Company Limited. The net proceeds from the offering were used to partially reduce the amount outstanding under the senior unsecured bridge loan facility, which had a balance of $754
million at December 31, 2008.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we tested goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment. As a result of decreased global equity valuations, the tightening of industrial and retail end markets and a resulting decline in our 2009 projected financial performance, we incurred a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $3,710.0
million, $3,385.0 million after-tax.

Significant events in 2007

On November 30, 2007, we completed the sale of our Bobcat, Utility Equipment and Attachments business units (collectively, Compact Equipment) to Doosan Infracore for cash proceeds of approximately
$4.9 billion, subject to post-closing purchase price adjustments. Compact Equipment manufactured and sold compact equipment including skid-steer loaders, compact track loaders, mini-excavators and telescopic tool handlers; portable air compressors,
generators, light towers; general-purpose light construction equipment; and attachments. We are currently in the process of resolving the final purchase price adjustments with Doosan Infracore.

On April 30, 2007, we completed the sale of our Road Development business unit to AB Volvo (publ) for cash proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. The
Road Development business unit manufactured and sold asphalt paving equipment, compaction equipment, milling machines and construction-related material handling equipment.

During 2007, we repurchased 39.7 million common shares at a cost $1,999.9 million under our existing $4 billion share repurchase program. This repurchase program was originally authorized by the
Board of Directors in December 2006 to repurchase up to $2 billion and subsequently expanded to $4 billion in May 2007.



Results of Operations

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 0.2%, or $32.1 million, compared with the same period of 2008, which primarily resulted
from the following:

Volume/product mix

-15.5

-0.2

%

The acquisition of Trane increased net revenues by $2,096.3 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase, which represented 15.9% of the year-over-year change in revenues, was a consequence of 2008 reported results only
reflecting activity since the Acquisition Date. Excluding the results of Trane, revenues decreased by 16.1%, or $2,128.4 million, which resulted from lower volumes and product mix (16%) and an unfavorable currency impact (1%). These reductions
were partially offset by improved pricing (1%). The Trane commercial and residential HVAC businesses also experienced substantial volume declines during the year.



Net revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2008 increased by 50.9%, or $4,464.3 million, compared with the same period of 2007, which primarily resulted from the following:

The acquisition of Trane on June 5, 2008 increased revenues by $4,401.3 million compared to the same period in 2007. The increase, which represented 50.2% of the year-over-year change in revenues, was a consequence of 2008 reported
results including activity since the Acquisition Date. Excluding the results of Trane, revenues increased by 0.7%, or $63.0 million. Softening overall demand in many major end-markets was the primary driver of the volume reduction. However, we
continued to make progress in increasing recurring revenues, which improved by 6% over prior year and accounted for 19% of net revenues in 2008.

Cost of Goods Sold

For the year ended December 31, 2009, cost of goods sold decreased by $103.0 million, or 1.1%
compared to the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Trane increased cost of goods sold by $1,421.8 million, which contributed 14.6% to the year-over-year change. Excluding the results of Trane, cost
of goods sold decreased by $1,524.8 million, or 15.7% as a result of increased productivity actions and expense reduction across the businesses. These actions helped to mitigate the impact of lower volumes due to the continued global weakness in our
major end markets. As a result, cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased to 73.1% from 73.7%. In addition, cost of goods sold included $58.3 million of restructuring costs compared to restructuring and integration costs of $56.7
million in 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, cost of goods sold increased by $3,476.1 million compared to the same period in
2007. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Trane, which contributed $3,330.8 million to the year-over-year increase. As a result, cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased to 73.7% compared with 71.6% for the same
period of 2007. In addition, cost of goods sold included $56.7 million of restructuring and integration costs compared to restructuring costs of $24.8 million in 2007. Higher material costs and unfavorable business and product mix more than offset
price increases. In addition, decreased leverage due to lower volumes contributed to the year-over-year increase.

Selling and
Administrative Expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2009, selling and administrative expense increased by $365.5 million, or
15.6% compared to the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Trane increased selling and administrative expenses by $558.5 million, which contributed 23.8% to the year-over-year change. Excluding the
results of Trane, selling and administrative expense decreased by $193.0 million, or 8.2% as a result of increased productivity actions and expense reduction across the businesses. These actions partially offset the dramatic decline in volume
experienced during 2009. As a result, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 20.5% compared with 17.7% for the same period of 2008. In addition, selling and administrative expense included $53.1 million of
restructuring costs compared to $34.2 million of restructuring and integration costs in 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2008,
selling and administrative expense increased by $909.8 million compared to the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Trane, which contributed $877.3 million to the year-over-year-increase. As a result, selling
and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 17.7% compared with 16.3% for the same period of 2007. In addition, selling and administrative expense included $34.2 million of restructuring and integration costs compared to $3.9
million of restructuring costs in 2007. Decreased leverage due to lower volumes more than offset expense reduction and price increases.



Asset Impairment

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we tested goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. As a result of decreased
global equity valuations, the tightening of industrial and retail end markets and a resulting decline in our 2009 projected financial performance, we incurred a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $3,710.0 million, $3,385.0 million after-tax.

The following table summarizes the impairment charges that were taken by sector during 2008:

For a further discussion of impairment related matters, see Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets under Critical Accounting Policies and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Operating Margin

Operating margin
for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased to 6.4% from a negative 19.5% for the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 was impacted by
a non-cash charge of $3,710.0 million related to an asset impairment recognized in the fourth quarter. Excluding the asset impairment, which had a 28.1 point impact on 2008 operating margins, year-over-year operating margins decreased by 2.2 points.
The primary drivers of the decrease related to lower volumes, an unfavorable currency impact and lower margins in the acquired Trane businesses. Results were further impacted by $111.4 million of restructuring costs which impacted operating margins
in 2009 by 0.8 points. Productivity actions, expense reduction and improved pricing helped to mitigate the impact of the continued global weakness in our major end markets.

Operating margin decreased from 12.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007 to a negative 19.5% for the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Operating
margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 was impacted by a non-cash charge of $3,710.0 million related to an asset impairment recognized in the fourth quarter. Excluding the asset impairment, which had a 28.1 point impact on 2008 operating
margins, year-over-year operating margins decreased by 3.5 points. The primary drivers of the decrease related to lower volumes, higher commodity costs and an unfavorable business and product mix. Results were further impacted by restructuring and
integration costs associated with the acquisition of Trane in June 2008. Productivity actions, expense reduction and improved pricing helped to mitigate the impact of the global weakness in our major end markets.

Interest Expense

Interest expense
for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $56.8 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase is primarily related to higher average debt levels as a result of the funding of the acquisition of Trane in June 2008.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $109.2 million compared with the same period of 2007. The increase is primarily
related to significantly higher debt levels used to help fund the acquisition of Trane in June 2008.



Other, Net

The year-over-year changes in Other, net primarily resulted from the following:

For the year ended December 31, 2009, Other, net decreased by $43.5 million compared with the same period of 2008. The decrease was primarily related to lower interest income as a result of lower average cash balances during the year.
The decrease was partially offset by lower exchange losses in 2009. In addition, we recorded income of approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily related to a favorable settlement with an insurance carrier associated with a
portion of our asbestos obligation. The settlement is included in other in the table above.

Included in currency exchange gains (losses)
above is a $24 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009, associated with the recent devaluation in the Venezuelan Bolivar. At December 31, 2009, we remeasured our foreign currency receivables and payables associated with the
Venezuelan Bolivar at the parallel rate of 6.0 Bolivars for each U.S. dollar, based on our inability to settle certain transactions through the official government channels in an expeditious manner. Previously, we remeasured all foreign currency
transactions at the official rate of 2.15 Bolivars for each U.S. dollar. In addition, effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated highly inflationary, as the blended Consumer Price Index/National Consumer Price Index reached
cumulative three-year inflation in excess of 100% during the fourth quarter of 2009. As such, all future foreign currency fluctuations will be recorded in income.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, Other, net increased by $33.0 million compared with the same period of 2007. The increase was a result of greater interest income generated by higher average
cash balances prior to the acquisition of Trane in June 2008. The increase was partially offset by currency losses due to significant volatility in currency exchange rates, predominately in the fourth quarter.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the
year ended December 31, 2009, the effective tax rate was 12.8% compared to 7.5% in 2008. The 2009 tax rate was below the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, have a lower
effective rate. The 5.3 point increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of an increase in valuation allowances as well as changes in earnings mix offset by a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the effective tax rate was 7.5%. The tax rate was substantially below the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0%
primarily due to the large impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter, as well as earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, have a lower effective rate. Excluding the impairment charge, the adjusted effective rate would
have been 12.4%, compared with an effective rate of 21.8% in 2007. The 9.4 point reduction in the effective rate is primarily the result of lower earnings in high tax jurisdiction during 2008. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial
statements for further discussion of tax matters.

Review of Business Segments

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to more closely reflect our corporate and business strategies and to promote
additional productivity and growth. Our segments are now as follows: Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies. As part of the



change, we eliminated the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment which represented the acquired Trane business and created two new reportable segments, the Climate Solutions segment and
the Residential Solutions segment. See Note 24 in the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the segment realignment.

The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations.

Climate Solutions

Our Climate Solutions segment delivers energy-efficient
refrigeration and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) throughout the world. Encompassing the transport and stationary refrigeration markets as well as the commercial HVAC markets, this segment offers customers a broad range of products,
services and solutions to manage controlled temperature environments. This segment includes the market leading brands of Hussmann, Thermo King and Trane.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to eliminate the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment, which represented the Trane commercial and residential
businesses acquired at the close of business on June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date). As a result, the Trane commercial HVAC business is now incorporated within the newly created Climate Solutions segment, along with the transport and stationary
refrigeration business. Reported results include revenue and operating income from the Trane commercial HVAC business for the six months and 25 days since the Acquisition Date in 2008 and for the full year in 2009.

2009 vs 2008

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 8.0% or $543.1 million, compared with the same period of 2008, which primarily resulted

Net revenues in the Trane commercial HVAC business increased $1,522.2 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase, which represented 22.5% of the segment’s year-over-year increase, was a consequence of 2008 reported
results only reflecting activity since the Acquisition Date.

Net revenues in the transport and stationary refrigeration business decreased
29.2%, or $979.1 million, compared with the same period of 2008. The decrease, which had a 14.5% impact on the segment’s year-over-year results, was primarily due to lower volumes and product mix (14%) and an unfavorable currency impact
(1%). These reductions were slightly offset by improved pricing (1%).

Trane commercial HVAC revenues were impacted by a continued decline in
activity in non-residential construction markets in all major geographic areas, except Asia. Both equipment and service revenue, as well as parts, services and solutions were impacted by the decrease in end market activity. Net revenues in our
transport



and stationary refrigeration businesses decreased primarily as a result of the continued decline in the heavy truck market in Europe. However, improved activity in the U.S. and Asian refrigerated
trailer and truck markets during the fourth quarter helped to mitigate the declines in Europe. In addition, sea-going container revenues and worldwide bus revenues have begun to improve in the fourth quarter due to an increase in end market
activity. Worldwide display cases and contracting revenue were impacted by continued slower supermarket capital expenditures in both the U.S. and Europe.

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by $1,178.7 million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase was a result of a non-cash charge of $1,240.0 million
recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Excluding the impairment, which had an 18.3 point impact on 2008 operating margins, year-over-year operating income
decreased 13.1% or $61.3 million.

Excluding the asset impairment charge of $1,200.0 million in 2008, operating income in the Trane commercial
HVAC business increased $101.7 million compared with the same period in 2008, which only included the results of Trane for the six months and 25 days since the Acquisition Date. This increase had a 21.7% impact to segment operating income. However,
operating results for the year were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in volumes and pricing, partially offset by increased productivity and improved material costs.

Included in 2009 operating income within the Trane commercial HVAC business was $97.3 million of ongoing purchase accounting charges primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. In
addition, we recorded $26.1 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans. These costs had a combined 1.7 point impact on the segment’s 2009
operating margins. 2008 comparable amounts were $48.1 million related to ongoing purchase accounting costs and $14.6 million related to severance and other business integration costs. In addition, 2008 operating income included $147.4 million in
non-recurring purchase accounting charges associated with the fair value allocation of purchase price to backlog, inventory and in-process research and development costs. These costs had a combined 3.1 point impact on the segment’s 2008
operating margins.

Operating income in our transport and stationary refrigeration business decreased by 51.1%, or $163.0 million, compared
with the same period of 2008, excluding the $40.0 million asset impairment charge in 2008. This decrease, which had a 34.8% impact on segment operating income, resulted from lower volumes and product mix ($313 million) and an unfavorable currency
impact. This decrease was partially offset by increased productivity ($127 million) and improved pricing ($34 million). In addition, we recorded $11.6 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other
costs associated with announced restructuring plans.

2008 vs 2007

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 100.2% or $3,378.2 million, compared with the same period of 2007. The dramatic year-over-year increase was a result of the inclusion of
the Trane commercial HVAC business since the Acquisition Date in 2008 operating results, which totaled $3,393.8 million for the period. Excluding the results of Trane, net revenues decreased by 0.5% or $15.6 million, compared with the same period in
2007. The slight decrease in the year-over-year results were primarily due to lower volumes (4%) offset by a favorable currency impact (3%) and improved pricing.

Net revenues for the Trane commercial HVAC businesses decreased in both domestic and international markets. Increased revenues for
parts, services and solutions were more than offset by a decline in equipment revenue. Net revenues for our transport and stationary refrigeration business decreased primarily as a result of the decline in the truck market, which decreased
refrigerated trailer and truck revenues in North America and Europe. In addition, sea-going container revenues, as well as bus and aftermarket revenues also decreased as a result of slower end market activity. Worldwide display cases and contracting
revenue decreased due to declines in display case sales to regional supermarkets in the U.S. and a sharp decline in the installation business. However, sales of the TriPac

®

auxiliary unit continued to experience substantial growth in 2008.



Operating income for the year
ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $1,154.4 million compared to the same period of 2007. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a non-cash charge of $1,240.0 million related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
assets within the segment. The charge had an 18.3 point impact on operating margins in 2008.

Excluding the asset impairment, the Trane
commercial HVAC business added $149.3 million of operating income to the segment since the Acquisition Date. Included within operating income is $147.4 million in non-recurring purchase accounting charges associated with the fair value allocation of
purchase price to inventory step-up, backlog amortization and in-process research and development costs. In addition, ongoing purchase accounting charges, primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets, were $48.1 million. Other
significant charges associated with the acquisition were $14.6 million and were primarily related to severance and other business integration costs. These costs had a combined 3.1 point impact on the segment’s operating margins in 2008.

Excluding the asset impairment, operating income in our transport and stationary refrigeration business for the year ended December 31,
2008 decreased by 16.6% or $63.7 million, compared to the same period in 2007. During 2008, we recorded $38.6 million of restructuring charges associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring
plans. Other factors contributing to the year-over-year decrease were lower volumes and product mix ($73 million) and increased material costs ($46 million), partially offset by increased productivity ($51 million), improved pricing ($44 million)
and a favorable currency impact.

Residential Solutions

Our Residential Solutions segment provides safety, comfort and efficiency to homeowners throughout North America and parts of South America. It offers customers a broad range of products, services and
solutions including mechanical and electronic locks, energy-efficient HVAC systems, indoor air quality solutions, advanced controls, portable security systems and remote home management. This segment is comprised of well-known brands like American
Standard, Schlage and Trane.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to eliminate the Air Conditioning
Systems and Services segment, which represented the Trane commercial and residential businesses acquired at the close of business on June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date). As a result, the Trane residential HVAC business is now incorporated
within the newly created Residential Solutions segment, along with our residential security business. Reported results include revenue and operating income from the Trane residential HVAC business for the six months and 25 days since the Acquisition
Date in 2008 and for the full year in 2009.

Net revenues in the Trane
residential HVAC business increased $574.1 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase, which represented 39.0% of the segment’s year-over-year increase, was a consequence of 2008 reported results only reflecting activity since
the Acquisition Date. Net revenues for the Trane residential HVAC business for the year ended December 31, 2009 were impacted by lower volumes and reduced pricing.

Net revenues in the residential security business decreased by 9.9%, or $46.3 million, compared with the same period of 2008. The decrease, which had a 3.2% impact on the segment’s year-over-year
results, was primarily due to lower volumes and product mix (4%). These reductions were slightly offset by improved pricing (1%).

Trane
residential HVAC revenues were impacted by continued weakness in the U.S. housing market. However, improved fourth quarter sales to the replacement market helped to mitigate the slower end market activity. Residential security revenues were impacted
by lower same store sales at large customers and ongoing weakness in the new homebuilder channel. In the fourth quarter, these declines were more than offset by new product revenues and market share gains.

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by $2,159.9 million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase was a result
of a non-cash charge of $2,110.0 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets within the Trane residential HVAC business. Excluding the impairment, which had a
143.2 point impact on 2008 operating margins, year-over-year operating income increased by 68.4% or $49.9 million.

Excluding the asset
impairment charge in 2008, operating income in the Trane residential HVAC business increased $43.1 million compared with the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane for the six months and 25 days since the Acquisition Date. This
increase had a 59.0% impact to segment operating income, excluding impairment. However, operating results for the year were impacted by a reduction in volumes and pricing, offset by increased productivity and improved material costs.

Included in 2009 operating income for the Trane residential HVAC business was $80.6 million of ongoing purchase accounting charges primarily related to the
amortization of intangible assets. In addition, we recorded $7.5 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans. These costs had a combined 4.4
point impact on the segment’s 2009 operating margins. 2008 comparable amounts were $33.0 million related to ongoing purchase accounting costs and $5.6 million related to severance and other business integration costs. In addition, 2008
operating income included $11.0 million in non-recurring purchase accounting charges associated with the fair value allocation of purchase price to backlog, inventory and in-process research and development costs. These costs had a combined 3.3
point impact on the segment’s 2008 operating margins.

Operating income in our residential security business increased by 11.7%, or $6.8
million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase, which had a 9.3% impact on segment operating income, resulted from increased productivity ($18 million) and improved pricing ($10 million). This increase was partially offset by lower
volumes and product mix ($16 million). In addition, we recorded $1.4 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans.

2008 vs. 2007

Net revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2008 increased by 180.3% or $948.0 million, compared with the same period of 2007. The dramatic year-over-year increase was a result of the inclusion of the Trane residential HVAC business since the Acquisition Date, which
totaled $1,007.5 million for the period. Excluding the results of Trane, net revenues decreased by 11.3% or $59.5 million, compared with the same period in 2007. The decrease in year-over-year results were primarily due to lower volumes
(22%) offset by improved pricing (10%).

Net revenues for the Trane residential HVAC businesses decreased in all markets. In addition,
net revenues for our residential security business decreased primarily due to lower volume as a result of lower same store sales at large customers and ongoing weakness in the new homebuilder channel.



Operating income for the year
ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $2,081.9 million, compared to the same period of 2007. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a non-cash charge of $2,110.0 million related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
assets within the Trane residential HVAC business. Excluding the asset impairment charge, which had a 143.2 point impact on operating margins in 2008, year-over-year operating income increased by 62.6% or $28.1 million.

Excluding the asset impairment, the Trane residential HVAC business added $15.0 million of operating income to the segment since the Acquisition Date in
2008. This increase contributed 33.4% to the year-over-year increase in overall operating income. Included within operating income is $11.0 million in non-recurring purchase accounting charges associated with the fair value allocation of purchase
price to inventory step-up, backlog amortization and in-process research and development costs. In addition, ongoing purchase accounting charges, primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets, were $33.0 million. Other significant
charges associated with the acquisition were $5.6 million and were primarily related to severance and other business integration costs. These costs had a combined 3.3 point impact on the segment’s operating margins in 2008.

Operating income in our residential security business for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 29.2% or $13.1 million, compared to the same
period in 2007. Factors contributing to the year-over-year increase were improved pricing ($51 million) and increased productivity ($16 million) partially offset by lower volumes and product mix ($53 million). In addition, we recorded $6.3 million
of restructuring charges in 2008 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announce restructuring plans.

Industrial Technologies

Our Industrial Technologies segment provides products, services and solutions that enhance
energy efficiency, productivity and operations. It offers our global customers a diverse and innovative range of products including compressed air systems, tools, pumps, fluid handling systems, golf and utility vehicles in addition to

2009 vs 2008

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net revenues decreased by 25.8% or $757.3 million, compared with the
same period of 2008. The primary drivers of the year-over-year decrease were lower volumes and product mix (25%) and an unfavorable currency impact (2%). These reductions were partially offset by improved pricing (1%).

Revenues in the Air and Productivity Solutions business declined in all geographic areas. The decrease in the U.S. was a result of volume declines in major
industrial, process and fluid handling end markets as well as lower aftermarket results. Non-U.S. revenues were also impacted by volume declines in industrial activity. Club Car revenues sharply decreased in all geographic areas due to weakening
economic fundamentals in key golf, hospitality and recreation markets. In addition, the decline was impacted by customers deferring golf car replacement by extending their leases. Market share gains and growth in low-speed vehicle sales at Club Car
helped to offset some of the slow end market activity.

Operating income decreased by 51.4% or $181.9 million during 2009. During 2009, we
recorded $27.1 million of restructuring charges associated with employee termination benefits and other cost associated with announced restructuring plans, which had a 1.2 point impact on operating margins. The remaining decrease was primarily
related to lower volumes and product mix ($263 million), an unfavorable currency impact ($20 million) and higher material costs ($17 million). These reductions were partially offset by increased productivity ($123 million) and improved pricing ($16
million).



2008 vs 2007

For the year ended December 31, 2008, net revenues increased by 2.1% or $61.2 million, compared with the same period of 2007. The primary drivers of
the year-over-year increase were improved pricing (2%), acquisitions (2%) and a favorable currency impact (1%). The improved results were partially offset by lower volumes and product mix (3%).

The increase in segment revenue was driven by the worldwide increase in the Air and Productivity Solutions business. However, lower volumes in all
geographic areas in the second half of the year show the weakening industrial and fluid handling end markets. In addition, slower industrial production levels as well as the deferral of some maintenance by customers more than offset aftermarket
growth. Club Car revenues declined in all geographic areas compared with 2007 mainly due to weak economic fundamentals in key golf, hospitality and recreation markets. However, the business continued to gain market share in the declining golf market
and a softening utility vehicle market.

Operating income decreased by 9.8% or $38.3 million during 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we
recorded $9.6 million of restructuring charges associated with employee termination benefits and other cost associated with announced restructuring plans, which had a 0.4 point impact on operating margins. The remaining decrease was primarily
related to higher material costs ($61 million), lower volumes and product mix ($42 million) and increased spending on new product development ($15 million). These reductions were partially offset by improved pricing ($62 million) and increased
productivity ($46 million).

Security Technologies

Our Security Technologies segment is a leading global provider of products and services that make environments safe, secure and productive. The segment’s market-leading solutions include electronic
and biometric access control systems and software, locks and locksets, door closers, exit devices, steel doors and frames as well as time, attendance and personnel scheduling systems. These products serve a wide range of markets including the
commercial construction market, healthcare, retail, maritime and transport industries as well as educational and governmental facilities. This segment includes the CISA, LCN, Schlage and Von Duprin brands.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to eliminate the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment, which
represented the Trane commercial and residential businesses acquired at the close of business on June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date). As a result, the Trane residential HVAC business is now incorporated within the newly created Residential
Solutions segment, along with our residential security business. As a result, our residential security business is no longer included as a part of our Security Technologies segment, which now represents our commercial security business.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, net revenues decreased by 16.7% or $345.7 million, compared with the same period of 2008. The year-over-year
decrease was primarily related to lower volumes and product mix (17%) and an unfavorable currency impact (2%). These reductions were partially offset by improved pricing (2%).

The decrease in net revenues was a result of the recent decline in the worldwide contracting of construction markets. Revenues were impacted by the decline in new building and remodeling markets in the
United States and Europe.



Operating income for the year
ended December 31, 2009 increased by 663.4% or $281.3 million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase was a result of a non-cash charge of $360.0 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the impairment of
goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and marketable securities within the segment. The charge had a 17.4 point impact on 2008 operating margins.

Excluding the asset impairment charge, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 19.6% or $78.7 million, compared with the same period in 2008. The decrease was primarily a
result of lower volumes and product mix ($179 million) and an unfavorable currency impact ($14 million). These reductions were partially offset by increased productivity ($75 million), improved pricing ($46 million) and lower material costs ($15
million). We also recorded $24.5 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans.

2008 vs 2007

For the year ended December 31, 2008, net revenues increased by 3.9% or
$76.9 million, compared with the same period of 2007. The year-over-year increase was primarily related to improved pricing (3%) and a favorable currency impact (1%).

Net revenues increased slightly during the year driven by electronic solutions growth in Asia. However, declines in the North American commercial construction market and well as in Europe during the
fourth quarter significantly lowered year-over-year revenues.

Operating income decreased by 89.1% or $346.2 million during 2008. In the
fourth quarter, we recognized a non-cash charge of $360.0 million related to the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and marketable securities within the segment. The charge had a 17.4 point impact on operating margins
in 2008.

Excluding the impairment charge, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 3.6% or $13.8 million,
compared to the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily a result of improved pricing ($68 million) and productivity gains ($26 million), which more than offset the decrease in volume ($22 million), increased material costs ($16 million) and
a negative currency impact ($7 million). We also recorded $6.8 million of restructuring charges in 2008 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans.

Discontinued Operations

The
components of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

During 2009, we recorded a tax benefit of $28 million primarily associated with reducing our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and a tax charge of $29 million associated with correcting immaterial accounting errors. See Note 20 to
the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these tax matters.

Pre-tax loss from operations in 2007 includes a
non-cash charge of $449.0 million related to our liability for all pending and estimated future asbestos claims through 2053 as discussed below in “Other Discontinued Operations.”



Discontinued operations by
business for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

Compact Equipment Divestiture

On July 29, 2007, we agreed to sell our Bobcat, Utility Equipment and Attachments business
units (collectively, Compact Equipment) to Doosan Infracore for gross proceeds of approximately $4.9 billion, subject to post closing purchase price adjustments. The sale was completed on November 30, 2007. We are currently in the process of
resolving the final purchase price adjustments with Doosan Infracore.

Compact Equipment manufactured and sold compact equipment, including
skid-steer loaders, compact track loaders, mini-excavators and telescopic tool handlers; portable air compressors, generators and light towers; general-purpose light construction equipment; and attachments. We accounted for Compact Equipment as
discontinued operations within the income statement.

Net revenues and after-tax earnings of Compact Equipment for the years ended
December 31 were as follows:

Road Development Divestiture

On February 27, 2007, we agreed to sell our Road
Development business unit to AB Volvo (publ) for cash proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. The sale was completed on April 30, 2007.

The Road Development business unit manufactured and sold asphalt paving equipment, compaction equipment, milling machines and construction-related material handling equipment. We accounted for the Road Development business unit as
discontinued operations within the income statement.

Net revenues and after-tax earnings of the Road Development business unit for the years
ended December 31 were as follows:



Other Discontinued
Operations

We also have retained costs from previously sold businesses that mainly include costs related to postretirement benefits,
product liability and legal costs (mostly asbestos-related). The components of other discontinued operations for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a non-cash charge of $449.0 million ($277 million after-tax) related to our liability for all pending and
estimated future asbestos claims through 2053. Refer to Note 23 in the consolidated financial statements for further details on asbestos-related matters.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed
a comprehensive financing program that significantly enhanced our liquidity and debt profile. Actions taken include the issuance of $1.0 billion of long-term debt (Senior Notes and Exchangeable Senior Notes) in April 2009 and the replacement of our
Trane accounts receivable purchase program in March 2009 with a new accounts receivable purchase program that encompassed originators from all four of our business segments. The proceeds from our debt issuance were used to repay the $950.0 million
outstanding under our senior unsecured bridge loan facility.

We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash
generated by our operations, our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for the foreseeable future.

Liquidity

The following table contains
several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the period ended December 31:

The large cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2007 is attributable to the sale of both the Compact Equipment and the Road Development business units during 2007, which generated proceeds of $6,154.3 million. The lower
cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2008 is a result of the acquisition of Trane.



Short-term borrowings and
current maturities of long-term debt consisted of the following:

Commercial Paper Program

We use borrowings under our commercial paper program for general
corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings after paying down $998.7 million during 2009. We funded these payments primarily using cash generated from operations.

Senior Unsecured Bridge Loan Facility

In
connection with the Trane acquisition, we entered into a $3.9 billion senior unsecured bridge loan facility, with a 364-day term. We drew down $2.95 billion against the bridge loan facility in June 2008. The proceeds, along with cash on hand and the
issuance of $1.5 billion in commercial paper, were used to fund the cash component of the consideration paid for the acquisition as well as to pay for related fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition.

As of December 31, 2008, our outstanding balance of the senior unsecured bridge loan facility was $754 million after a $196 million payment in the
fourth quarter of 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, we borrowed an additional $196 million under the facility, increasing the outstanding balance to $950.0 million as of March 31, 2009. We repaid the outstanding balance in April 2009 with
proceeds from our long-term debt issuance as discussed below and terminated the facility.

Debentures with Put Feature

At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding $547.9 million of fixed rate debentures which only requires early repayment at the option of the holder. These
debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date. If exercised, we are obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder’s option, the outstanding principal amount (plus accrued and
unpaid interest) of the debentures held by the holder. If these options are not fully exercised, the final maturity dates would range between 2027 and 2028.

In 2008, holders of these debentures chose to exercise the put feature on $202.2 million of the debentures. As a result, approximately $345.7 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2008. In
2009, holders of these debentures chose to exercise the put feature on $2.1 million of the remaining debentures. As a result, approximately $343.6 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2009. In February 2010, holders of these debentures
have the option to exercise the put feature on $37.2 million of the outstanding debentures. Based on our cash flow forecast, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to repay any amounts redeemable as a result of these put features.

Long-Term Debt

In August 2008, we filed
a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance and issued $1.6 billion of long-term debt pursuant to the shelf registration statement through
our wholly owned subsidiary, IR Global Holding Company Limited. This issuance consisted of $250 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due in 2010, $600 million 6.000% Senior Notes due in 2013 and $750 million 6.875% Senior Notes due in 2018. These
notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited. The net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce the amount outstanding under the senior unsecured bridge loan facility.



Interest on the fixed rate
notes will be paid twice a year. We have the option to redeem them in whole or in part at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the debt offering documents. Interest on the floating
rate notes will be paid four times a year. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations.

Senior Notes Due 2014

In April 2009, we issued $655 million of 9.5% Senior Notes through
our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global). The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International. Interest on the fixed rate notes will be paid twice a
year in arrears. We have the option to redeem them in whole or in part at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement. The notes are subject to certain customary
covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations.

Exchangeable Senior Notes Due 2012

In April 2009, we issued $345 million of 4.5% Exchangeable Senior Notes through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. The notes are
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International. Interest on the exchangeable notes will be paid twice a year in arrears. In addition, holders may exchange their notes at their option prior to
November 15, 2011 in accordance with specified circumstances set forth in the indenture agreement or anytime on or after November 15, 2011 through their scheduled maturity. Upon exchange, the notes will be paid in cash up to the aggregate
principal amount of the notes to be exchanged, the remainder due on the option feature, if any, will be paid in cash, IR ordinary shares or a combination thereof at the option of the Company. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants,
however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations.

We allocated the proceeds of the exchangeable notes between
debt and equity, in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. We allocated approximately $305 million of the gross proceeds to debt, with the remaining discount of approximately $40 million (approximately $39 million after
allocated fees) recorded within equity. Additionally, we will amortize the discount into earnings over a three-year period.

Accounts
Receivable Purchase Program

On March 31, 2009, we expanded our existing Trane accounts receivable purchase program and replaced it
with a new accounts receivable purchase program that encompassed originators from all four of our business segments. The increase in originators allowed us to increase the program size from $150 million to $325 million. At December 31, 2009,
the outstanding balance of eligible trade receivables sold to an affiliated master special purpose vehicle was $544.2 million. However, no net interests have been sold to any of the three conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions.
In the first quarter of 2010, we expect to terminate the new accounts receivable purchase program prior to its expiration in March 2010. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the program.

Pension Plans

Our investment objectives in
managing defined benefit plan assets are to ensure that present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries are met as they become due; to provide a total return that, over the long-term, minimizes our required contributions
at the appropriate levels of risk; and to meet any statutory or regulatory requirements.

We monitor the impact of market conditions on our
funding requirements and pension plan expense on a quarterly basis. None of our pension plans have experienced any significant impact on their liquidity to pay retirees in the plans due to the volatility in the markets. For further details on
pension plan activity, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.



Cash Flows

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $1,751.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2009 compared with $374.3 million in 2008. Prior year operating cash flows were impacted by a tax payment of approximately $700 million in the first quarter of 2008 paid to various taxing authorities primarily associated with
the Compact Equipment divestiture. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 include significant improvements in accounts receivable collections and inventory management, in addition to the results of Trane for
the entire period.

Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $374.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2008 compared with $826.3 million in 2007. The change was primarily related to tax payments of approximately $1.1 billion paid to various taxing authorities, $594.4 million associated with the Compact Equipment divestiture. Tax
payments in 2007 were approximately $470 million. In addition, cash flows from operating activities include Trane cash flows from operations since the Acquisition Date.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was
$182.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with $7,306.4 million in 2008. The change in investing activities is primarily attributable to cash used for the acquisition of Trane in 2008.

Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $7,306.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with net cash
provided by continuing operations of $6,052.4 million in 2007. The change is primarily attributable to cash used for the acquisition of Trane in 2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash proceeds of $6,154.3 million
was received related to the sale of Compact Equipment and the Road Development business unit.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1,208.1 million, compared with $2,760.6 million of net cash provided
by financing activities during 2008. The change in financing activities is primarily related to the proceeds received from the bridge loan facility and commercial paper used to finance the acquisition of Trane in June 2008. During the year ended
December 31, 2009, we refinanced the bridge loan facility and repaid the amounts outstanding on our commercial paper program.

Net cash
provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $2,760.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with $2,568.5 million of net cash used in financing activities during 2007. The change in financing activities
primarily relates to the outstanding balance of both our bridge loan facility and commercial paper which were used to finance the acquisition of Trane. In addition, $1.6 billion relates to the net proceeds from our long-term debt issuance in August
2008. Furthermore, 2007 was impacted by the repurchase of $2.0 billion of our outstanding shares.



Capital Resources

Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash generated from our
operations, our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next 12
months.

Capital expenditures were $204.2 million, $306.0 million and $119.7 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our investments
continue to improve manufacturing productivity, reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities. The capital expenditure program for 2010 is estimated to be approximately $250 million, including
amounts approved in prior periods. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges.

During 2007, we initiated restructuring actions relating to ongoing cost reduction efforts across each of our sectors. These actions include both workforce reductions as well as the consolidation of manufacturing facilities. In addition, we
announced plans to initiate enterprise-wide restructuring actions in October 2008. These actions include streamlining the footprint of manufacturing facilities and reducing the general and administrative cost base. As of December 31, 2009, we
have incurred approximately $182.1 million of costs associated with these restructuring actions since the fourth quarter of 2008.

For
financial market risk impacting the Company, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

Capitalization

In addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow, we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper programs. Our
ability to borrow at a cost-effective rate under the commercial paper programs is contingent upon maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2009, our credit ratings were as follows:

Short-term

Long-term

Moody’s

P-2

Baa1

Standard and Poor’s

A-2

BBB+

The credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.

In June 2008, we entered into a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a three-year term. The line is
unused and provides support for our commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes.

In addition to the three-year
credit facility, we have a committed revolving credit facility totaling $1.25 billion, which expires in August 2010. This line is unused and provides support for our commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes. Other
available non-U.S. lines of credit were $993.3 million, of which $823.9 million were unused at December 31, 2009. These lines provide support for bank guarantees, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes.

Our public debt does not contain any financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debt-to-total capital covenant of 65%. As of
December 31, 2009, our debt-to-total capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit.

Guarantees

As part of the reorganization of IR-New Jersey in 2001, IR-Limited fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the issued public debt securities of IR-New
Jersey. IR-New Jersey unconditionally guaranteed payment of the



principal, premium, if any, and interest on IR-Limited’s 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2015 in aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The guarantee is unsecured and provided on an
unsubordinated basis. The guarantee ranks equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt of IR-New Jersey. In addition, public debt securities issued by IR Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global)
are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited.

As a part of the reorganization of IR-Limited in 2009, the guarantee structure was
updated to reflect the newly created legal structure under which (i) IR-International assumed the obligations of IR-Limited as issuer or guarantor, as the case may be, and (ii) IR-Ireland and IR-Limited fully and unconditionally guaranteed
the obligations under the various indentures covering the currently outstanding public debt of IR-International, IR-Global and IR-New Jersey. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited has issued or intends to issue guarantees in respect of any indebtedness
incurred by Trane.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods, in millions:

* Includes $343.6 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder. The scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028.

** Includes $345 million related to the Exchangeable Senior Notes due in 2012. See Note 13 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, environmental and asbestos matters have not been included in
the contractual cash obligations table above.

Pensions

At December 31, 2009, we had net obligations of $903.0 million, which consist of noncurrent pension assets of $1.1 million and current and non-current pension benefit liabilities of $904.1 million.
It is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. We currently project that we will contribute approximately $85
million to our plans worldwide in 2010. Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.

Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

At December 31, 2009, we had postretirement benefit obligations of $979.4 million. We fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis as medical costs are incurred by covered
retiree populations. Benefit payments, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be approximately $79 million in 2010. Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for
postretirement obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Income Taxes

At December 31, 2009, we have total unrecognized tax benefits for
uncertain tax positions of $525.1 million and $80.3 million of related accrued interest and penalties. The liability has been excluded from the preceding table



as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding
matters relating to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits and IRS tax disputes.

Environmental and Asbestos Matters

We are involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental and product
liability matters. We believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. Because the timing and amounts of
potential future cash flows are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

See Note 13 and Note 23 for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity.

Critical Accounting Policies

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are
based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles
requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. The
following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical.

•

Allowance for doubtful accounts – The Company has provided an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which represents the best estimate of
probable loss inherent in the Company’s accounts receivable portfolio. This estimate is based upon the Company’s policy, derived from its knowledge of its end markets, customer base and products.

•

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets – We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet related
to acquisitions. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value
of an asset may be less than the carrying amount of the asset.

Recoverability of goodwill is measured at
the reporting unit level and determined using a two step process. The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of
the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting
unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized.

As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two
valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (market approach), with each method being equally weighted in the calculation. In step 2, the implied fair value of goodwill
is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized
intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test, was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit.



Recoverability
of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated
fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. The calculation of estimated fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach) which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount
rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset.

The determination of estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill requires management to make assumptions about estimated
cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. Management developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit.

2009 Impairment Test

For our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2009, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying
values.

The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which
primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 11% to 15% and terminal growth rates
generally ranging from 2% to 5%. Under the market approach, management used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, management compared the estimate aggregate fair value of
its reporting units to the Company’s overall market capitalization.

For all reporting units except one, the excess of
the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15%. The one reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 15%, reported within the Climate Solutions segment, exceeded its
carrying value by 8%. This reporting unit has goodwill of approximately $840 million. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have
a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.

2008 Impairment Test

Due to the deterioration in the worldwide equity and credit markets and a tightening of industrial and retail end markets in the fourth
quarter of 2008, the Company’s market capitalization declined well below its book value. In addition, the weakening worldwide economic conditions resulted in our projected 2009 financial performance decline. As a result, the Company updated its
impairment testing through December 31, 2008. Based on the estimated fair value and book value of our reporting units, we recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 of approximately $3,710.0 million ($3,385.0 million
after-tax).

The assumptions used represent management’s best estimate of fair value. Under the income approach, we
assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 11%-15% and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 2%-5%. Under the market approach, management used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues
based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, management compared the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to the Company’s overall market capitalization.

•

Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles – Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be generated. Impairment in
the carrying value of an asset would be recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying



value. The impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by an estimate of discounted cash flows. The Company believes that
its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations.

•

Loss contingencies – Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and
administrative proceedings, environmental and asbestos matters and product liability, product warranty, worker’s compensation and other claims. The Company has recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are
developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and
engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, the Company believes its estimated reserves are reasonable and does not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to
these matters would have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company for any year.

•

Asbestos matters – Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal
courts. The Company records a liability for its actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements. Although the Company was neither a manufacturer nor producer of asbestos, some of its formerly
manufactured components from third party suppliers utilized asbestos related components. As a result, the Company records certain income and expenses associated with our asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within discontinued
operations, net of tax, as they relate to previously divested businesses. Income and expenses associated with Trane’s asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries are recorded within continuing operations. Refer to Note 23 in the
consolidated financial statements for further details of asbestos-related matters.

•

Revenue recognition – Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales
arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of
ownership have substantially transferred to the customer. Revenue from maintenance contracts or extended warranties is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, unless another method is more representative of the costs
incurred. The Company enters into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation and service revenue. For multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has
stand-alone value to the customer, fair values of undelivered elements are known, customer acceptance has occurred, and there are only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements. Revenues from certain of our equipment and
the related installation sold under construction-type contracts are recorded using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with GAAP.

•

Income taxes – Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and non-U.S. tax credits, to the
extent that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not. The Company regularly reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets considering its historic profitability, projected future taxable income,
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of its tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, the Company records a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” (ASC 740) which prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, ASC 740



provides guidance on the recognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.

The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in
the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income, and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company. In addition, tax authorities
periodically review income tax returns filed by the Company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. A
significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any
reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters. The Company will adjust its estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from the original or adjusted estimates of the Company, the effect will be
recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved.

•

Employee benefit plans – The Company provides a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement
and postemployment benefits. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, employee mortality and turnover rates and
health-care cost trend rates. Actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally
accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. The discount rate, the
rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined as of the measurement date. A discount rate reflects a rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. For U.S. plans, it is
established and based primarily on a study based on the Citigroup Pension Liability index. For non-U.S. plans, it is based upon a review of the current yields reported on AA corporate bonds or the yields of high-quality fixed-income investments
available and expected to be available during the life of the plans. The rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns
expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy,
the types of assets held and the target asset allocation. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of the measurement date. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable
based on input from its actuaries, outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors.

Changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost. Estimated sensitivities to the net periodic pension cost of a 0.25% rate decline in
the two basic assumptions are as follows: the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $9.6 million and the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $6.4 million. A 0.25% rate decrease in the
discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.8 million and a 1.0% increase in the health-care cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately $2.0 million.

The preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in the Company’s results for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate
differences, if any, between the Company’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.



Recently Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements:

FASB ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” (ASC 715) requires an entity to measure its defined
benefit plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position. The measurement date provisions of ASC 715 are effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31,
2008. The Company has adopted the measurement provisions of ASC 715, which resulted in an after-tax charge to Retained earnings in the amount of $3.7 million ($6.5 million pre-tax) in 2008. Plans acquired during 2008 were not impacted by this
change.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” (ASC 740) which
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As a result of adopting these provisions of ASC 740 as of January 1,
2007, the Company recorded additional liabilities to its previously established reserves, and corresponding decrease in Retained earnings of $145.6 million.

In September 2006, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (ASC 820) to provide a framework for measuring fair value that is based on the
assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information to develop those assumptions. Additionally, the guidance expands the disclosures about
fair value measurements to include disclosing the fair value measurements of assets or liabilities within each level of the fair value hierarchy. These provisions of ASC 820 were effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2008. In
accordance with ASC 820, the Company has delayed its implementation of these provisions for the fair value of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and nonfinancial long-lived assets and liabilities. Refer to Note 16 in the consolidated
financial statements for a full discussion of these provisions of ASC 820.

In February 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC
825, “Financial Instruments” (ASC 825) which allows companies the option, at specified election dates, to measure financial assets and liabilities at their current fair value, with the corresponding changes in fair value from period to
period recognized in the income statement. Additionally, ASC 825 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and
liabilities. These provisions of ASC 825 are effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has not elected this option available under ASC 825.

In December 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance to address the financial accounting and reporting for business combinations, which can be found in FASB
ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (ASC 805). ASC 805 supersedes SFAS 141, “Business Combinations” and retains the fundamental requirements set forth therein regarding the purchase method of accounting. However, it expands the
guidance to enable proper recognition and measurement, at fair value, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business. In addition, ASC 805 introduces new accounting guidance on how to
recognize and measure contingent consideration, contingencies, acquisition and restructuring costs. These provisions of ASC 805 are effective for acquisitions occurring after January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 810, “Consolidations” (ASC 810) which clarifies that a noncontrolling interest
in a subsidiary represents an ownership interest that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, ASC 810 requires expanded income statement presentation and disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish
between the interests of the Company and the interests of the non-controlling owners of the subsidiary. ASC 810, as it relates to noncontrolling interests, is effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2009. See Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements for a discussion on these provisions of ASC 810.

In March 2008, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 815,
“Derivatives and Hedging” (ASC 815) which amends and expands the disclosures previously required. ASC 815 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value
amounts of gains



and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The expanded disclosure requirements found in ASC 815 as they relate
to the modifications made in March 2008 are effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2009. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these provisions of ASC 815.

In May 2008, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 470, “Debt” (ASC 470) which requires us to allocate between debt and equity the
proceeds of the Company’s exchangeable notes, in a manner that reflects the Company’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. In addition, the Company is required to amortize any discount into earnings over a period of three years. These
provisions of ASC 470 became applicable to the Company during the second quarter of 2009, upon issuance of the exchangeable senior notes in April 2009.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance
within ASC 810. These revisions eliminate FASB Interpretation 46(R)’s exceptions to consolidating qualifying special-purpose entities, contain new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary, and increase the frequency of required
reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. ASC 810 also contains a new requirement that any term, transaction, or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity’s
status as a variable interest entity, a company’s power over a variable interest entity, or a company’s obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying FASB Interpretation
46(R)’s provisions. The elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity concept and its consolidation exceptions means more entities will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments. These provisions of ASC 810 are effective
as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within that first period, with earlier adoption prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the potential impacts, if any, on its
consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 860, “Transfers and Servicing”
(ASC 860). These revisions eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, create more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarify other sale- accounting criteria, and change the
initial measurement of a transferor’s interest in transferred financial assets. These provisions of ASC 860 will be effective for transfers of financial assets in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009 and in interim periods within
those fiscal years with earlier adoption prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the potential impacts, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial
condition. To manage certain of those exposures, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts. Derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not
used for trading or speculative purposes. To minimize the risk of counter party non-performance, derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments.

Foreign Currency Exposures

We have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell their products in various international markets. As a result, we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar as well as against
other currencies throughout the world. We actively manage the currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the operating unit level. Exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating
unit to an insignificant amount are hedged with foreign currency derivatives. We also have non-U.S. currency net asset exposures, which we currently do not hedge with any derivative instrument.



We evaluate our exposure to
changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential gain or loss in fair value based on a percentage increase or decrease in exchange rates.
Based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at December 31, 2009, a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10% increase in exchange rates would result in an unrealized gain of
approximately $69.1 million, as compared with an unrealized gain of $23.9 million at December 31, 2008. These amounts would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying currency transactions.

Commodity Price Exposures

We are exposed
to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure. We do not have any committed commodity derivative instruments in place at December 31, 2009.

Interest Rate Exposure

Our debt portfolio
mainly consists of fixed-rate instruments, and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
as of December 31, 2009, that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that all material information required to be filed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported when
required and the information is accumulated and communicated, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework.

Management concluded that based on its assessment, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2009.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in
the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Index to Consolidated Financial Statements

F-1


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Ingersoll-Rand plc:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Ingersoll-Rand plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
“Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed the manner in which it accounts for
uncertain tax positions effective January 1, 2007, and the manner in which it accounts for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in 2008.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY

On
July 1, 2009, Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited (IR-Limited), a Bermuda company, completed a reorganization to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the parent company of Ingersoll Rand from Bermuda to Ireland. As a result, IR-Ireland
replaced IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company effective July 1, 2009. All references related to the Company prior to July 1, 2009 relate to IR-Limited.

NOTE 2 – THE REORGANIZATION

On March 5, 2009, the Company’s board of
directors approved a reorganization that would change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the parent company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Ireland Reorganization). The first step in the Ireland Reorganization was the establishment of
IR-Limited’s tax residency in Ireland, which occurred in March 2009. Subsequently, IR-Ireland replaced IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Bermuda law (the Scheme of Arrangement). Major milestones
to complete the Scheme of Arrangement were as follows:

•

On April 1, 2009, IR-Limited formed IR-Ireland as a direct subsidiary.

•

On April 20, 2009, IR-Limited petitioned the Supreme Court of Bermuda to order the calling of a meeting of the Class A common shareholders of
IR-Limited to approve the Scheme of Arrangement.

•

On April 23, 2009, the Supreme Court of Bermuda ordered IR-Limited to seek the approval of its Class A common shareholders on the Scheme of
Arrangement.

•

On June 3, 2009, IR-Limited received the requisite approval from its Class A common shareholders.

•

On June 11, 2009, the Supreme Court of Bermuda issued an order (the Sanction Order) approving the Scheme of Arrangement.

On June 30, 2009, IR-Limited filed the Sanction Order with the Bermuda Registrar of Companies and, at 12:01 a.m. on
July 1, 2009 (the Transaction Time) the following steps occurred simultaneously:

•

All fractional shares of IR-Limited held of record were cancelled and IR-Limited paid to each holder of fractional shares that were cancelled an amount
based on the average of the high and low trading prices of the IR-Limited Class A common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on June 29, 2009.

•

All previously outstanding whole Class A common shares of IR-Limited were cancelled.

•

IR-Limited issued to IR-Ireland 319,166,220 Class A common shares.

•

IR-Ireland issued 319,166,220 ordinary shares to holders of whole IR-Limited Class A common shares that were cancelled as a part of the Scheme of
Arrangement.

F-7


•

All previously outstanding ordinary shares of IR-Ireland held by IR-Limited and its nominees were acquired by IR-Ireland and cancelled for no
consideration.

As a result of the Ireland Reorganization, IR-Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of IR-Ireland and the
Class A common shareholders of IR-Limited became ordinary shareholders of IR-Ireland. All references related to the Company prior to July 1, 2009 relate to IR-Limited.

The Ireland Reorganization did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. Ingersoll-Rand plc will continue to be subject to United States Securities and Exchange Commission
reporting requirements and prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Shares of Ingersoll-Rand plc will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “IR”, the
same symbol under which the Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited Class A common shares previously traded.

See Note 18 for a discussion of the
modifications made to the Company’s equity-based plans. See Notes 13 and 25 for a discussion of certain modifications to the indentures governing the Company’s outstanding notes, medium-term notes and debentures and the documents relating
to the Company’s commercial paper program.

NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follows:

Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidated operations of the Company and have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC). In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all
adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated results for the periods presented.

The
Company adopted the FASB’s new standard for accounting for noncontrolling interests on January 1, 2009. A noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest that should now be reported as equity in the consolidated
financial statements. As a result, the Company now includes noncontrolling interests as a component of Total shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are now presented as
an adjustment from Net earnings (loss) used to arrive at Net earnings (loss) attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Prior to the adoption of this new standard, earnings associated with noncontrolling interests
were reported as a component of Other, net.

As discussed in Note 4, the Company acquired Trane Inc. (Trane) at the close of business on
June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date). The results of operations of Trane have been included in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2009. The consolidated statements of income and cash flows
for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date.

Certain reclassifications of amounts
reported in prior years have been made to conform to the 2009 classification.

Reorganization:

IR-Ireland is the successor
to IR-Limited following a corporate reorganization that became effective on July 1, 2009 (the Ireland Reorganization). IR-Limited is the successor to Ingersoll-Rand Company, a New Jersey corporation (IR-New Jersey), following a corporate
reorganization that occurred on December 31, 2001 (the Bermuda Reorganization). Both the Ireland Reorganization and the Bermuda Reorganization were accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control and accordingly, did not
result in any changes to the consolidated amounts of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity.

F-8


Principles of
Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company. Partially-owned equity affiliates are accounted for under the equity method. The Company is also required to consolidate
variable interest entities in which it bears a majority of the risk to the entities’ potential losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entities’ expected returns. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The
assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have been separately reported as discontinued operations and held for sale for all periods presented.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Estimates are based on several factors including the facts and circumstances available at the time the estimates are made, historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends, and the assessment of the probable future
outcome. Some of the more significant estimates include accounting for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, purchase price allocations of acquired businesses, valuation of assets including goodwill
and other intangible assets, product warranties, sales allowances, pension plans, postretirement benefits other than pensions, taxes, environmental costs, product liability, asbestos matters and other contingencies. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the statement of operations in the period that they are determined.

Currency Translation:

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries, where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have been
translated at year-end exchange rates, and income and expenses accounts have been translated using average exchange rates throughout the year. Adjustments resulting from the process of translating an entity’s financial statements into the U.S.
dollar have been recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency are subject to changes in
exchange rates with the resulting gains and losses recorded within net earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less.

Marketable Securities:

The Company has classified its marketable securities as available-for-sale in accordance with GAAP. Available-for-sale marketable securities are accounted for at
market prices, with the unrealized gain or loss, less applicable deferred income taxes, recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If any of the Company’s marketable securities experience other than temporary declines in
value as defined by GAAP, a loss is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Inventories:

Depending on the
business, U.S. inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Non-U.S. inventories are primarily stated at the lower of
cost or market using the FIFO method. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 44% and 45%, respectively, of all inventory utilized the LIFO method.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

:  The Company has provided an allowance for doubtful accounts reserve which represents the best estimate of probable loss inherent in the Company’s
account receivables portfolio. This estimate is based upon company policy, derived from knowledge of its end markets, customer base and products. The Company reserved $57.6 million and $52.1 million for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively.

F-9


Property, Plant and
Equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Assets placed in service are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset
except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the shorter of their economic useful life or their lease term. The range of useful lives used to depreciate property, plant and equipment is as follows:

Buildings

10 to 50 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15 years

Software

2 to 7 years

Repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are charged against earnings as incurred. Major replacements and significant improvements that increase asset values and extend useful lives are capitalized.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

The Company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets
acquired. Once the final valuation has been performed for each acquisition, adjustments may be recorded.

In accordance with GAAP, goodwill
and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less
than the carrying amount of the asset.

Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two step
process. The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step
of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the
implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized.

Recoverability of other indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets. Any excess of the carrying value over
the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess.

Intangible assets such as patents, customer-related
intangible assets and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. The weighted-average useful lives approximate the following:

Customer relationships

20 years

Trademarks

25 years

Completed technology/patents

10 years

Other

10 years

*

* Excludes intangibles acquired and fully expensed in the year of acquisition.

F-10


Recoverability of intangible
assets with finite useful lives is assessed in the same manner as property, plant and equipment as described above.

Income
Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which
the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and non-U.S. tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not. The
Company regularly reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets considering its historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of its tax planning
strategies. Where appropriate, the Company records a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit.

Product
Warranties:

Warranty accruals are recorded at the time of sale and are estimated based upon product warranty terms and historical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its liabilities and will make adjustments as necessary
based on known or anticipated warranty claims, or as new information becomes available.

Treasury Stock:

The Company,
through one of its consolidated subsidiaries, has repurchased its common shares from time to time in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions as authorized by the Board of Directors. These repurchases are based upon current market
conditions and the discretion of management. Amounts are recorded at cost and included within the Shareholders’ equity section. For the year ended December 31, 2008, common shares owned by the Company amounted to 52.0 million. During 2009,
the Company cancelled approximately 52.0 million treasury shares in anticipation of the Ireland Reorganization.

Revenue
Recognition:

Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably
assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer. Revenue from maintenance contracts or extended
warranties is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, unless another method is more representative of the costs incurred. The Company enters into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation
and service revenue. For multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, fair values of undelivered elements are known, customer acceptance has
occurred, and only customary refund or return rights exist related to the delivered elements. Revenues from certain of our equipment and the related installation sold under construction-type contracts are recorded using the percentage-of-completion
method in accordance with GAAP.

Environmental Costs:

The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting
the environment. Environmental expenditures relating to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which do not contribute to current or future revenues, are
expensed. Liabilities for remediation costs are recorded when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. The assessment of
this liability, which is calculated based on existing technology, does not reflect any offset for possible recoveries from insurance companies, and is not discounted.

Asbestos Matters

:  Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. The Company records a liability for
its actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements. Although the Company was neither a manufacturer nor producer of asbestos, some of its formerly manufactured components from third party suppliers
utilized asbestos related components. As a result, amounts related to asbestos are recorded within Discontinued operations, net of tax, except for amounts related to Trane asbestos liabilities, which are recorded in continuing operations. Refer to
Note 23 for further details of asbestos related matters.

F-11


Research and Development
Costs:

The Company conducts research and development activities for the purpose of developing and improving new products and services. These expenditures, including qualifying engineering costs, are expensed when incurred. For the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, these expenditures amounted to $257.4 million, $204.6 million and $128.6 million, respectively. The Company also incurs engineering costs that are not considered research and development
expenditures.

Software Costs:

The Company follows the guidance outlined in FASB ASC 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill
and Other” (ASC 350) for all software developed or obtained for internal use, which requires companies to capitalize certain internal-use software costs once specific criteria are met and subsequently amortize these costs over the
software’s useful life, which ranges from 2 to 7 years.

Employee Benefit Plans

:

The Company provides a range of
benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement and post-employment benefits. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates,
expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, employee mortality and turnover rates, and health-care cost trend rates. Actuaries perform the required calculations to determine expense in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods. These amounts are generally recognized into Shareholders’ equity on an
annual basis. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. In 2008, the Company changed the measurement date for all defined
benefit plans from November 30 to December 31, as required by GAAP.

Loss Contingencies:

Liabilities are recorded
for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and administrative proceedings, environmental matters, product liability, product warranty, worker’s compensation and other claims. The Company has
recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances
with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, the Company believes its estimated reserves are reasonable and does
not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company for any year.

Derivative Instruments:

The Company periodically enters into cash flow and other hedge transactions to specifically hedge exposure to
various risks related to interest rates, currency rates and commodity pricing. The Company recognizes all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value as either assets or liabilities. For cash flow designated hedges, the
effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative contract are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, and are recognized in the income statement at the time earnings are affected by the hedged
transaction. For other derivative transactions, the changes in the fair value of the derivative contract are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:

FASB ASC 715, “Compensation –
Retirement Benefits,” (ASC 715) requires an entity to measure its defined benefit plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position. The measurement date provisions of ASC
715 are effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. The Company has adopted the measurement provisions of ASC 715, which resulted in an after-tax charge to Retained earnings in the amount of $3.7 million ($6.5
million pre-tax) in 2008. Plans acquired during 2008 were not impacted by this change.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
the provisions of FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” (ASC 740) which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As
a result of adopting these provisions of

F-12


ASC 740 as of January 1, 2007, the Company recorded additional liabilities to its previously established reserves, and corresponding decrease in Retained earnings of $145.6 million.

In September 2006, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (ASC 820) to
provide a framework for measuring fair value that is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information to develop those
assumptions. Additionally, the guidance expands the disclosures about fair value measurements to include disclosing the fair value measurements of assets or liabilities within each level of the fair value hierarchy. These provisions of ASC 820 are
effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2008. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has delayed its implementation of these provisions for the fair value of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and nonfinancial long-lived
assets and liabilities. Refer to Note 16 for a full discussion of these provisions of ASC 820.

In February 2007, the FASB issued revised
guidance within FASB ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” (ASC 825) which allows companies the option, at specified election dates, to measure financial assets and liabilities at their current fair value, with the corresponding changes in fair
value from period to period recognized in the income statement. Additionally, ASC 825 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar
assets and liabilities. These provisions of ASC 825 are effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has not elected the option available under ASC 825.

In December 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance to address the financial accounting and reporting for business combinations, which can be found in FASB
ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (ASC 805). ASC 805 supersedes SFAS 141, “Business Combinations” and retains the fundamental requirements set forth therein regarding the purchase method of accounting. However, it expands the
guidance to enable proper recognition and measurement, at fair value, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business. In addition, ASC 805 introduces new accounting guidance on how to
recognize and measure contingent consideration, contingencies, acquisition and restructuring costs. These provisions of ASC 805 are effective for acquisitions occurring after January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 810, “Consolidations” (ASC 810) which clarifies that a noncontrolling interest
in a subsidiary represents an ownership interest that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, ASC 810 requires expanded income statement presentation and disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish
between the interests of the Company and the interests of the non-controlling owners of the subsidiary. ASC 810, as it relates to noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, is effective for the Company starting on January 1,
2009.

In March 2008, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (ASC 815), which amends and
expands the disclosures previously required. ASC 815 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and
disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The expanded disclosure requirements found in ASC 815 as they relate to the modifications made in March 2008 are effective for the Company starting on
January 1, 2009. See Note 14 for a discussion of these provisions of ASC 815.

In May 2008, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB
ASC 470, “Debt” (ASC 470) which requires us to allocate between debt and equity the proceeds of the Company’s exchangeable notes, in a manner that reflects the Company’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. In addition, the
Company is required to amortize any discount into earnings over a period of three years. These provisions of ASC 470 became applicable to the Company during the second quarter of 2009, upon issuance of the exchangeable senior notes in April 2009.

F-13


Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements:

In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance within ASC 810. These revisions eliminate FASB Interpretation 46(R)’s
exceptions to consolidating qualifying special-purpose entities, contain new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary, and increase the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a
variable interest entity. ASC 810 also contains a new requirement that any term, transaction, or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity’s status as a variable interest entity, a company’s power over a variable
interest entity, or a company’s obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying FASB Interpretation 46(R)’s provisions. The elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity
concept and its consolidation exceptions means more entities will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments. These provisions of ASC 810 are effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after November 15,
2009, and for interim periods within that first period, with earlier adoption prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the potential impacts, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 860, “Transfers and Servicing” (ASC 860). These revisions eliminate the concept of
a qualifying special-purpose entity, create more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarify other sale-accounting criteria, and change the initial measurement of a transferor’s interest in
transferred financial assets. These provisions of ASC 860 will be effective for transfers of financial assets in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009 and in interim periods within those fiscal years with earlier adoption prohibited.
The Company is currently assessing the potential impacts, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 4 – ACQUISITION OF
TRANE INC.

At the close of business on June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date), the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the
outstanding common shares of Trane. Trane, formerly American Standard Companies Inc., provides systems and services that enhance the quality and comfort of the air in homes and buildings around the world. Trane’s systems and services have
leading positions in premium commercial, residential, institutional and industrial markets, a reputation for reliability, high quality and product innovation and a powerful distribution network.

The Company paid a combination of (i) 0.23 of an IR-Limited Class A common share and (ii) $36.50 in cash, without interest, for each
outstanding share of Trane common stock. The total cost of the acquisition was approximately $9.6 billion, including change in control payments and direct costs of the transaction. The Company financed the cash portion of the acquisition with a
combination of cash on hand, commercial paper and a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility.

The components of the purchase price were
as follows:

F-14


The Company allocated the
purchase price of Trane to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon acquisition in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141, “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141). The following
table summarizes the fair values of the Trane assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Acquisition Date.

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued compensation and benefits were stated at their historical carrying values, which approximate their fair value, given
the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.

Inventories were recorded at fair value, based on computations which considered many
factors, including the future estimated selling price of the inventory, the cost to dispose of the inventory, as well as the replacement cost of the inventory, where applicable.

F-15


The Company recorded intangible
assets based on their estimated fair value, and consisted of the following:

The Company has allocated $3,418.0 million to tradenames, primarily related to the Trane brand. Management considered many factors in the determination that it will account for the asset as an indefinite lived intangible asset, including
the current market leadership position of the brand as well as recognition worldwide in the industry. Therefore, in accordance with ASC 350, indefinite-lived tradenames will not be amortized, but instead will be tested for impairment at least
annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present).

In addition, the Company assigned $26.0 million to in-process research and
development assets that were expensed at the date of acquisition in accordance with GAAP. The expenses are included in general and administrative expenses.

The excess of the purchase price over the amounts allocated to specific assets and liabilities is included in goodwill, and amounted to $5,525.8 million. The premium in the purchase price paid by the
Company for the acquisition of Trane reflects the establishment of a business offering high value equipment, systems and services necessary for delivering solutions across the temperature spectrum for indoor, stationary and transport applications
worldwide. The Company anticipates realizing significant operational and cost synergies. Anticipated synergies include purchase material savings through supplier rationalization and procurement leverage, improvement in manufacturing costs and lower
general and administrative costs. Longer term, the Company expects to benefit from synergies related to service revenue expansion, leverage of distribution channels and cross selling through certain vertical markets.

In addition, Trane will be able to leverage the Company’s global footprint to enhance their historically U.S.-based revenue generation. Lastly, the
combined business will improve the Company’s highly regarded Hussmann and Thermo King brands with Trane’s position as a leader in the commercial and residential climate control industry. These combined factors primarily contributed to a
purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired.

out-of-pocket transaction costs associated with the acquisition.

F-16


For the year ended
December 31, 2008, the Company recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $3.7 billion related to the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived assets, which is reflected in the pro forma results presented above. For a further discussion of
impairment related matters, see Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma information does not purport to be

NOTE 5 – ASSET IMPAIRMENT

The Company
has significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets related to acquisitions. The Company’s goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or when there
is a significant change in events circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset may be less than the carrying amount of the asset.

2008 Impairment Test

Due to the deterioration in the worldwide equity and credit markets and a tightening of industrial and
retail end markets in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company’s market capitalization declined well below its book value. In addition, the weakening worldwide economic conditions resulted in the Company’s projected 2009 financial
performance to decline. As a result, the Company updated its impairment testing through December 31, 2008.

The following table
summarizes by reportable segment, the asset impairment charges taken during 2008:

Goodwill

Recoverability of goodwill impairment is measured at the reporting unit level and
determined using a two step process. The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not
impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit’s carrying value of
goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized.

The calculation of estimated fair value is based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (market approach), with
each method being equally weighted in the calculation. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to
all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step of
the goodwill impairment test, was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit.

Based on the estimated fair value and book value of our
reporting units, the Company recorded an impairment charge to goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2008 of approximately $2,840.0 million.

F-17


Indefinite-lived Intangible
Assets

Recoverability of other indefinite-lived intangible assets (i.e. Tradenames) is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess.

The calculation of estimated fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach), which is based on the implied royalty paid, at
an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset.

Based on the estimated fair value and book value of our Tradenames, the Company recorded an impairment charge to certain tradenames in the fourth quarter of
2008 of approximately $860.0 million.

Marketable Securities

Investments in marketable securities are recorded at cost and subsequently measured at fair value. These assets are periodically reviewed at the individual security level to determine if any decline in
value is considered to be other than temporary.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company determined that its investment in certain
marketable securities was other than temporarily impaired by approximately $10.0 million. This analysis was based on the current trading value of the publicly listed marketable security in addition to other qualitative factors of the operating
business environment in which the security is held.

2009 Impairment Test

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company performed its annual impairment test on goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. As a result, the Company determined that the fair value of the
reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. Therefore, no impairment charges were recorded during 2009.

NOTE 6 – RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES

Restructuring charges recorded during the year
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

F-18


The changes in the
restructuring reserve were as follows:

During the first three quarters of 2008, the Company incurred costs of approximately $20 million associated with various restructuring activities as a part of an ongoing effort to increase efficiencies across multiple lines of business. In
October 2008, the Company announced an enterprise-wide restructuring program necessitated by the severe economic downturn. This program included streamlining the footprint of manufacturing facilities and reducing the general and administrative cost
base across all sectors of the company. Projected costs totaled $110 million when the program was announced, of which $71 million was incurred during the fourth quarter of 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company expanded the scope of the restructuring program. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company has incurred approximately $182.1
million associated with these restructuring actions. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $54.9 million accrued for workforce reductions and the consolidation of manufacturing facilities.

Restructuring actions taken in the Climate Solutions sector include the closure of one manufacturing facility in Asia and workforce reductions in all
regions. As of December 31, 2009, the Climate Solutions sector had incurred approximately $87 million since the fourth quarter of 2008.

Restructuring actions taken in the Residential Solutions sector include general workforce reductions due to a revised organizational structure within the sector. As of December 31, 2009, the Residential Solutions sector had incurred
approximately $19 million since the fourth quarter of 2008.

Restructuring actions taken in the Industrial Technologies sector include the
consolidation of manufacturing facilities in the Americas and general workforce reductions across all regions. As of December 31, 2009, the Industrial Technologies sector had incurred approximately $32 million since the fourth quarter of 2008.

Restructuring actions taken in the Security Technologies sector include the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in the Americas region
and general workforce reductions in Europe and the Americas. As of December 31, 2009, the Security Technologies sector had incurred approximately $29 million since the fourth quarter of 2008.

Corporate costs primarily related to the consolidation of administrative offices in the U.S. As of December 31, 2009, the corporate costs totaled
approximately $15 million since the fourth quarter of 2008.

F-19


NOTE 7 – MARKETABLE
SECURITIES

At December 31, marketable securities were as follows:

Long-term marketable securities are included within Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

During 2008, the Company’s long-term marketable securities experienced other than temporary declines in value as defined by GAAP. The Company recognized a loss of approximately $10 million related to
investments within the Security Technologies segment in the fourth quarter of 2008. The loss is included in Asset impairment on the Consolidated Statement of Income. For a further discussion of impairment related matters, see Note 5 in the
consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 8 – INVENTORIES

At December 31, the major classes of inventory were as follows:

NOTE 9 – PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

At December 31, the major classes of property, plant and equipment were as
follows:

Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $262.1 million, $201.2 million and $112.3 million, which include amounts for software amortization of $47.3 million, $35.5 million and $17.5 million,
respectively.

During 2009, the Company purchased property, plant and equipment totaling approximately $39 million, with a corresponding
increase in liabilities. This represents a non-cash investing activity and is therefore not included in the statement of cash flows until the property, plant and equipment is paid for in accordance with GAAP.

F-20


NOTE 10 – GOODWILL

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

* Includes adjustments related to final purchase price allocation adjustments.

The Company records as goodwill the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Once the final valuation has been performed for each acquisition, adjustments may be recorded.

In June 2008, the Company acquired the Trane commercial HVAC business and the Trane residential HVAC businesses and recorded $5.5 billion of goodwill associated with the transaction. The results of the
Trane commercial HVAC business are reported within the Climate Solutions segment and the Trane residential HVAC business is reported within the Residential Solutions segment. See Note 4 for a further discussion regarding goodwill associated with the
acquisition of Trane.

As a result of the annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recognized a pre-tax, non-cash
charge of $2,840.0 million related to the impairment of goodwill. The Company does not have any accumulated impairment losses subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” other than the amounts
recorded in 2008. See Note 5 for a further discussion of impairment related matters.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company reduced its
goodwill by approximately $37 million in the Climate Solutions and Residential Solutions segments related to the acquisition of Trane. These adjustments primarily relate to an overstatement of net deferred tax liabilities established during purchase
accounting and represent accounting errors. The Company does not believe that the accounting errors are material to any of its previously issued financial statements and therefore, has not adjusted any prior period amounts.

NOTE 11 –INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The
following table sets forth the gross amount and accumulated amortization of the Company’s intangible assets at December 31:

F-21


At December 31, 2009, the
Company had $5.0 billion of intangible assets. The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives in accordance with GAAP. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject
to amortization, but instead, are tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present).

Intangible
asset amortization expense for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $156.4 million, $226.3 million and $25.2 million, respectively. The increase in 2008 is attributable to the Company’s acquisition of Trane on June 5, 2008, which includes $125.0
million of non-recurring amortization expense related to the fair value allocation of purchase price to backlog and in-process research and development costs. The non-recurring amortization expense is included in Accumulated amortization and the
associated gross asset is included in Other in the above table. See Note 4 for a further discussion on the acquisition of Trane.

Estimated
amortization expense on existing intangible assets is approximately $163 million for each of the next five fiscal years.

NOTE 12 –
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS

In connection with the acquisition of Trane, the Company acquired Trane’s accounts receivable
purchase agreement (the Trane Facility) in the U.S. As part of this Facility, Trane formed a special-purpose entity (SPE) for the sole purpose of buying and selling receivables generated by Trane. Trane irrevocably and without recourse, transferred
all eligible accounts receivable to the SPE, which, in turn, sold undivided ownership interests in them to a conduit administered by the participating bank. The assets of the SPE were not available to pay the claims of Trane or any of its
subsidiaries.

The undivided interests in the receivables sold to the conduit as a part of the Trane Facility were removed from the balance
sheet since they met the applicable criteria under GAAP. Trane’s interests in the receivables retained by the Company were recorded at its allocated carrying amount, less an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts, in the balance sheet as of
December 31, 2008. To the extent that the consideration received was less than the allocated carrying value of the receivables sold, losses were recognized at the time of sale.

On March 31, 2009, the Company entered into new accounts receivable purchase agreements (the Expanded IR Facility), to expand the existing accounts receivable purchase agreement. The Expanded IR
Facility superseded the Trane Facility. As of December 31, 2009, there are no interests in the receivables retained by the Company related to the Trane Facility.

Under the Expanded IR Facility, the Company continuously sold, through certain consolidated special purpose vehicles, designated pools of eligible trade receivables to an affiliated master special purpose
vehicle (MSPV) which, in turn, sold undivided ownership interests to three conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions.

The
maximum purchase limit of the three conduits was $325.0 million. The Company paid commitment fees on the aggregate amount of the liquidity commitments of the financial institutions under the facility (which was 102% of the maximum purchase limit)
and an additional program fee on the aggregate amounts purchased under the facility by the conduits to the extent funded through the issuance of commercial paper or other securities.

The MSPV was not designed to be a qualifying SPE since the MSPV transferred assets representing undivided ownership interests in the accounts receivables it held to the conduits. The Company concluded
that the MSPV was a variable interest entity (VIE) whereby the Company was deemed the primary beneficiary and subsequently consolidated the MSPV. Accordingly, accounts receivable balances were not removed from the balance sheet until the undivided
ownership interests were sold to the conduits. The remaining trade receivables transferred into the MSPV but not sold to the conduits remained in Accounts and notes receivable, net. The interests in the receivables retained by the Company were
exposed to the first risk of loss for any uncollectible amounts in the

F-22


receivables sold under the facility. The Company provided no other forms of continued financial support related to the undivided interests transferred to the conduits. Although the special
purpose vehicles were consolidated by the Company, they were separate corporate entities with their assets legally isolated from the Company and thus not available to satisfy claims of the Company.

The following is a summary of receivables sold to the financing facilities:

At December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of eligible trade receivables sold to the MSPV was $544.2 million. However, no net interests have been sold to any of the three conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions.

The Company serviced, administered and collected the receivables on behalf of the MSPV and the conduits and received a servicing fee of
0.75% per annum on the outstanding balance of the serviced receivables. As the Company estimated that the fee it received from the conduits, including other ancillary fees received, were adequate compensation for its obligation to service these
receivables, the fair value was zero and no servicing assets or liabilities were recognized.

During the year ended December 31, 2009,
the Company recorded a cash outflow of approximately $63 million within cash flow from operations, which represented the decrease in the net interests in the receivables sold to the conduits.

The Company records as a loss on sale the difference between the receivables sold and net cash proceeds received. The loss on sale recorded for the years
ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings after paying down $998.7 million during 2009. The Company funded these payments primarily using cash generated from operations.

Senior Unsecured Bridge Loan Facility

In connection with the Trane acquisition, the Company entered into a $3.9 billion senior unsecured bridge loan facility, with a 364-day term. The Company drew down $2.95 billion against the bridge loan
facility in June 2008. The proceeds, along with cash on hand and the issuance of $1.5 billion of commercial paper, were used to fund the cash component of the consideration paid for the acquisition as well as to pay related fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the acquisition.

In addition, the Company repaid $2.0 billion of the outstanding balance of the bridge loan
facility during the third quarter of 2008. The Company used a combination of cash flows from operations and cash on hand, in addition to the $1.6 billion in proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt. As of December 31, 2008, the
outstanding balance of the senior unsecured bridge loan facility was $754 million after a $196 million payment in the fourth quarter of 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company borrowed an additional $196 million under the facility,
increasing the outstanding balance to $950.0 million as of March 31, 2009. The Company repaid the outstanding balance in April 2009 with proceeds from the long-term debt issuance as discussed below and terminated the facility.

Debentures with Put Feature

At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding $345.7 million of fixed rate debentures which only requires early repayment at the
option of the holder. These debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date. If exercised, the Company is obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder’s option, the outstanding
principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) of the debentures held by the holder. If these options are not exercised, the final maturity dates would range between 2027 and 2028.

In 2009, holders of these debentures chose to exercise the put feature on $2.1 million of the remaining debentures. As a result, the Company had $343.6 million debentures outstanding at December 31,
2009.

Senior Notes Due 2014

In April 2009, the Company issued $655 million of 9.5% Senior Notes through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global). The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland,
IR-Limited and Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited (IR-International), another wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited. Interest on the fixed rate notes will be paid twice a year in arrears. The Company has the option to redeem them
in whole or in part at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are
considered restrictive to the Company’s operations.

Exchangeable Senior Notes Due 2012

In April 2009, The Company issued $345 million of 4.5% Exchangeable Senior Notes through its wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. The notes are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International. Interest on the exchangeable notes will be paid twice a year in arrears. Holders may exchange their notes at their option prior to November 15, 2011 in
accordance with specified circumstances set forth in the indenture agreement or anytime on or after November 15, 2011 through their scheduled maturity in April 2012. Upon exchange, the notes will be paid in cash up to the aggregate principal
amount of the notes to be exchanged, the remainder due on the option feature, if any, will be paid in cash, the Company’s ordinary shares or a combination thereof at the option of the Company. The notes are subject to certain customary
covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company’s operations.

The Company allocated approximately
$305 million of the gross proceeds to debt, with the remaining discount of approximately $40 million (approximately $39 million after allocated fees) recorded within equity. Additionally, the Company will amortize the discount into earnings over a
three-year period.

Other Debt

In August 2008, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance and issued $1.6 billion of long-term debt pursuant to
the shelf registration statement. This issuance consisted of $250 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due in 2010, $600 million 6.000% Senior Notes due in 2013 and $750 million 6.875% Senior Notes due in 2018. These notes are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited, which directly owns 100% of the subsidiary issuer, IR Global Holding Company Limited. The net proceeds from the offering were used to partially reduce the amount outstanding under the senior unsecured bridge
loan facility.

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s committed revolving credit facilities totaled $3.0 billion, of which $750
million expired in June 2009, and was not renewed. At December 31, 2009, the Company’s committed revolving credit facilities totaled $2.25 billion, of which $1.25 billion expires in August 2010 and $1.0 billion expires in June 2011. These
lines are unused and provide support for the Company’s commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes. In addition, other available non-U.S. lines of credit were $993.3 million, of which $823.9 million were unused at
December 31, 2009. These lines provide support for bank guarantees, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes.

Modifications Relating to
the Reorganization

In connection with the Ireland Reorganization discussed in Note 2, on July 1, 2009 at 12:01 A.M. (the Transaction
Time), IR-Limited completed the transfer of all the outstanding shares of IR-Global to IR-International, whereupon IR-International assumed the obligations of IR-Limited as an issuer or guarantor, as the case may be, under the indentures governing
the Company’s outstanding notes, medium-term notes and debentures. IR-Ireland and IR-Limited also fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment obligations of IR-International, IR-Global and Ingersoll-Rand Company (IR-New Jersey), a
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited incorporated in New Jersey, as the case may be, as the issuers of debt securities under these indentures. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited intends to issue guarantees in respect of any indebtedness
incurred by Trane. In addition, any securities issued by the Company that were convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Class A common shares of IR-Limited became convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as the case may be, into the
ordinary shares of IR-Ireland.

On July 1, 2009, IR-Global amended and restated its commercial paper program (the Commercial Paper
Program) pursuant to which IR-Global may issue, on a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.25 billion. Under the Commercial Paper Program, IR-Global may issue notes
from time to time, and the proceeds of the financing will be used for general corporate purposes. Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for the notes issued under the Commercial
Paper Program.

Pursuant to the terms of the credit facility entered into on August 12, 2005 and our credit facility entered into on
June 27, 2008 (the Credit Facilities), at the Transaction Time, IR-Ireland and IR-International became guarantors to such Credit Facilities. In connection therewith, IR-Ireland and IR-International entered into Addendums on July 1, 2009 to
become parties to the Credit Facilities.

NOTE 14 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, to manage risks associated with interest
rate, currency rate, commodity price and share-based compensation exposures. These financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.

On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative instrument either as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction, a cash flow hedge of a recognized asset or
liability, or as an undesignated derivative. The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identification of the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for
undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative instruments that are designated as hedges to specific assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions.

The Company also assesses both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the cash
flows of the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of a derivative instrument’s change in fair value is recorded in the income statement in the period of change. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective, or it becomes probable
that a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the hedging relationship will be undesignated and any future gains and losses on the derivative instrument would be recorded in the income statement.

The fair market value of derivative instruments are determined through market-based valuations and may not be representative of the actual gains or losses
that will be recorded when these instruments mature due to future fluctuations in the markets in which they are traded.

Currency and
Commodity Hedging Instruments

The notional amounts of the Company’s currency derivatives, excluding the cross currency swap described
below, were $884.8 million and $920.4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, a loss of $1.5 million and a gain of $7.6 million, net of tax, respectively, was included in

F-26


Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the fair value of the Company’s currency derivatives designated as accounting hedges. The amount expected to be reclassified into
earnings over the next twelve months is $1.5 million. The actual amounts that will be reclassified to earnings may vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. Gains and losses associated with the Company’s currency
derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in earnings as changes in fair value occur. At December 31, 2009, the maximum term of the Company’s currency derivatives was 12 months.

As a result of the acquisition of Trane in June 2008, the Company assumed a cross currency swap that fixed in U.S. dollars, the currency cash flows on the
£60.0 million 8.25% senior notes. These notes matured on June 1, 2009 along with the cross currency swap. The cross currency swap met the criteria to be accounted for as a foreign currency cash flow hedge, which allowed for deferral
of any associated gains or losses within AOCI until settlement. The deferred gain remaining in AOCI related to the cross currency swap was released into earnings upon maturity.

The Company had no commodity derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2009. The notional amount of the Company’s commodity derivatives was $21.3 million at December 31, 2008. During 2008,
the Company discontinued the use of hedge accounting for the commodity hedges at which time the Company recognized into the income statement all deferred gains and losses related to the commodity hedges at the time of discontinuance. All further
gains and losses associated with the Company’s commodity derivatives were recorded in earnings as changes in fair value occurred.

Other Hedging Instruments

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company entered into interest rate locks for the forecasted
issuance of approximately $1.4 billion of Senior Notes due in 2013 and 2018. These interest rate locks met the criteria to be accounted for as cash flow hedges of a forecasted transaction. Consequently, the changes in fair value of the interest rate
locks were deferred in AOCI. No further gain or loss will be deferred in AOCI related to these interest rate locks as the contracts were effectively terminated upon issuance of the underlying debt. However, the amount of AOCI associated with these
interest rate locks at the time of termination will be recognized into interest expense over the term of the notes. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $12.6 million and $14.4 million, respectively, of deferred losses remained in AOCI related to
these interest rate locks. The amount expected to be reclassified into interest expense over the next twelve months is $1.8 million.

In
August 2006, the Company entered into two total return swaps (the Swaps) which were derivative instruments used to hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in its share-based compensation expense. The aggregate notional amount of the Swaps was
approximately $52.6 million. On June 11, 2007, the Company terminated a portion of the Swaps for net cash proceeds of $3.8 million. The Company settled the remaining portion of the Swaps on August 6, 2007, for net cash proceeds of $13.8
million. The gains and losses associated with the Swaps were recorded within Selling and administrative expenses.

In March 2005, the Company
entered into interest rate locks for the forecasted issuance of $300 million of Senior Notes due 2015. These interest rate locks met the criteria to be accounted for as cash flow hedges of a forecasted transaction. Consequently, the changes in fair
value of the interest rate locks were deferred in AOCI. No further gain or loss will be deferred in AOCI related to these interest rate locks as the contracts were effectively terminated upon issuance of the underlying debt. However, the amount of
AOCI associated with these interest rate locks at the time of termination will be recognized into interest expense over the term of the notes. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $6.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of deferred losses
remained in AOCI related to these interest rate locks. The amount expected to be reclassified into interest expense over the next twelve months is $1.1 million.

The
counterparties to the Company’s forward contracts consist of a number of investment grade major international financial institutions. The Company could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties. However, credit
ratings of and concentration of risk in these financial institutions are monitored on a continuous basis and present no significant credit risk to the Company.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, short-term borrowings and accounts payable are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

NOTE 15 – PENSIONS AND
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

Pension Plans

The Company has noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all non-Trane U.S. employees and maintains a pension plan for non-collectively bargained U.S. employees of Trane, whereby eligible
employees may elect to participate and receive a credit equal to 3% of eligible pay. Effective January 1, 2010, non-collectively bargained U.S. employees of Trane began to participate in the Company’s main pension plan for U.S.
non-collectively bargained employees. In addition, the Company maintains pension plans for Trane U.S. collectively bargained employees. Certain non-U.S. employees in other countries, including Trane employees, are covered by pension plans.

Most of the Company’s pension plans for U.S. non-collectively bargained employees provided benefits on a final average pay formula. The
Company’s U.S. collectively bargained pension plans, including those covering employees of Trane, generally provide benefits based on a flat benefit formula. Generally, non-U.S. plans provide benefits based on earnings and years of service. The
Company maintains additional other supplemental benefit plans for officers and other key employees.

In 2008, the Company
adopted the measurement date provision of ASC 715 which required the measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the year-end financial statements. The Company recorded a one-time after-tax pension charge of $1.2 million to
Retained earnings ($1.8 million pre-tax) as a result of changing the measurement date from November 30

th

to December 31

st

.

As a
result of the acquisition of Trane in the second quarter of 2008, the Company assumed net obligations of $67.7 million, which consisted of noncurrent pension assets of $1.4 million and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of $69.1
million. In connection with the sale of Compact Equipment and the Road Development business unit during 2007, the Company settled its obligation for pension benefits for all current and former employees related to these divestitures. In addition,
certain of the Company’s U.S. plans and the U.K. plan were remeasured as of the sale dates.

F-29


The following table details
information regarding the Company’s pension plans at December 31:

It
is the Company’s objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. However, certain plans are not or cannot be funded
due to either legal or tax requirements in certain jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2009, approximately six percent of our projected benefit obligation relates to plans that cannot be funded.

F-30


The pretax amounts recognized
in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $3,442.2 million and $3,082.7 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair
value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations more than plan assets were $3,529.6 million, $3,382.7 million and $2,629.8 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009, and $3,194.8 million, $3,066.0 million and
$2,345.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2008.

Pension benefit payments are expected to be paid as follows:

F-31


The components of the
Company’s pension related costs for the years ended December 31, include the following:

The curtailment and settlement losses in 2009 are associated with restructuring of operations. The curtailment and settlement losses in 2008 are associated with lump sum distributions under supplemental benefit plans for officers and other
key employees. The curtailment and settlement gains and losses in 2007 are associated with the divestiture of Compact Equipment and the Road Development business unit.

Pension expense for 2010 is projected to be approximately $167 million, utilizing the assumptions for calculating the pension benefit obligations at the end of 2009. The amounts expected to be recognized
in net periodic pension cost during the year ended 2010 for the net transition obligation, prior service cost and plan net actuarial losses are $0.1 million, $8.8 million and $56.9 million, respectively.

Weighted-average assumptions used:

* Trane plans were valued at acquisition date assuming 6.75% for the discount rate, 4.00% for the rate of compensation increase and 8.25% for the expected return on plan assets

F-32


The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on
what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy, the types of assets held and target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of the measurement date. The Company reviews each plan and its historical
returns and target asset allocations to determine the appropriate expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to be used.

The
Company’s investment objectives in managing its defined benefit plan assets are to ensure that present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries are met as they become due; to provide a total return that, over the
long-term, minimizes required company contributions, at the appropriate levels of risk; and to meet any statutory and regulatory requirements. Key investment management decisions reviewed regularly are asset allocations and investment manager
performance. Asset/liability modeling (ALM) studies are used as the basis for global asset allocation decisions and are updated as required.

Based on ALM studies, the Company has set its target strategic global asset allocations for its plans to be broadly 40% equities and 60% debt and real estate. Asset allocations are reviewed at least quarterly and appropriate adjustments are
made as necessary.

The fair values of the Company’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2009 by asset category are as follows:

(a)

This class represents developed market equities of actively managed funds. Investment holdings include common stocks, preferred stocks and American
Depository Receipts.

(b)

This class includes commingled funds managed by investment managers that focuses on equity investments. It includes both indexed and actively managed
funds.

(c)

This class represents U.S. treasuries and state and municipal bonds.

(d)

This class comprises commingled funds actively managed by investment managers that focuses on fixed income securities.

(e)

This class includes insurance contracts with guaranteed income portion as well as sovereign debts.

(f)

This class includes several private equity funds that invest in real estate. It includes both direct investment funds and funds-of-funds.

(g)

This investment comprises the Company’s non-significant foreign pension plan assets. It mostly includes insurance contracts.

F-33


See Note 16 for additional
information related to the fair value hierarchy defined by FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (ASC 820).

The
Company made contributions to its pension plans of $113.5 million in 2009, $64.1 million in 2008, and $25.5 million in 2007. The Company currently projects that it will contribute approximately $85 million to its plans worldwide in 2010. The
Company’s policy allows it to fund an amount, which could be in excess of or less than the pension cost expensed, subject to the limitations imposed by current tax regulations. The Company anticipates funding the plans in 2010 in accordance
with contributions required by funding regulations or the laws of each jurisdiction.

Most of the Company’s U.S. employees are covered by
savings and other defined contribution plans. Employer contributions are determined based on criteria specific to the individual plans and amounted to approximately $86.0 million (including $50.6 million for Trane plans), $78.8 million (including
$43.5 million for Trane plans), and $47.8 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company’s contributions relating to non-U.S. defined contribution plans and other non-U.S. benefit plans were $19.5 million (including $1.7 million for
Trane plans), $16.3 million (including $3.8 million for Trane plans) and $11.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

The Company sponsors several postretirement plans that cover certain eligible
employees, including certain Trane employees since the Acquisition Date. These plans provide for health-care benefits, and in some instances, life insurance benefits. Postretirement health plans generally are contributory and contributions are
adjusted annually. Generally, life insurance plans for retirees are primarily noncontributory. The Company funds the postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis.

In 2008, the Company adopted the measurement date provision of ASC 715 which required the measurement of plan assets and benefit
obligations as of the date of the year-end financial statements. The Company recorded a one-time after-tax charge for postretirement benefits of $2.5 million to Retained earnings ($4.7 million pre-tax) as a result of changing the measurement date
from November 30

th

to December 31

st

.

As a result of the acquisition of Trane in the second quarter of 2008, the Company assumed unfunded obligations for retirement benefits other than pensions in the amount of $268.9 million. In connection
with the sale of Compact Equipment and the Road Development business unit during 2007, the Company settled its obligation for postretirement benefits for all current and former employees related to these divestitures. In addition, the Company’s
U.S. postretirement plan was remeasured as of the sale dates.

F-34

The components of net periodic
postretirement benefit (income) cost for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

The curtailment and settlement gains and losses in 2009 are associated with the restructuring of U.S. operations. The curtailment and settlement gains and losses in 2007 are associated with the divestiture of Compact Equipment and the Road
Development business unit. Postretirement cost for 2010 is projected to be $76 million. Amounts expected to be recognized in net periodic postretirement benefits cost in 2010 for prior service gains and plan net actuarial losses are $2.9 million and
$16.6 million, respectively.

NOTE 16 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ASC
820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value that is based on the inputs market participants use to determine the fair value of an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize those inputs. The Company adopted this
provision of ASC 820 on January 1, 2008. However, the Company has delayed its implementation of the provision of ASC 820 for the fair value of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and nonfinancial long-lived assets as allowed under
GAAP. The fair value hierarchy outlined in ASC 820 is comprised of three levels that are described below:

•

Level 1 – Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not
active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

•

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs based on little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities.

The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability
based on the best information available under the circumstances. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2009 are as follows:

F-37


See Note 15 for disclosure of
fair value measurements related to the Company’s pension assets.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company determines the fair
value of its financial assets and liabilities using the following methodologies:

•

Cash and cash equivalents

– These amounts include cash on hand, demand deposits and all highly liquid investments with original maturities
at the time of purchase of three months or less and are held in U.S and non-U.S. currencies.

•

Marketable securities

– These securities include investments in publically traded stock of non-U.S. companies held by non-U.S. subsidiaries
of the Company. The fair value is obtained for the securities based on observable market prices quoted on public stock exchanges.

•

Derivatives instruments

– These instruments include forward contracts related to non-U.S. currencies. The fair value of the derivative
instruments are determined based on a pricing model that uses inputs from actively quoted currency markets that are readily accessible and observable.

•

Benefit trust assets

– These assets include money market funds and insurance contracts that are the underlying for the benefit assets. The
fair value of the assets is based on observable market prices quoted in a readily accessible and observable market.

•

Benefit liabilities

– These liabilities include deferred compensation and executive death benefits. The fair value is based on the
underlying investment portfolio of the deferred compensation and the specific benefits guaranteed in a death benefit contract with each executive.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company also adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” (ASC 825) that allow companies the option, at specified election dates, to
measure financial assets and liabilities at their current fair value, with the corresponding changes in fair value from period to period recognized in the income statement. Additionally, ASC 825 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements
designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has not elected to utilize the fair value option on any of its financial
assets or liabilities.

NOTE 17 – SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited, a Bermuda Company (IR-Limited), was the successor to Ingersoll-Rand Company, a New Jersey Company (IR-New Jersey) following a corporate reorganization that became effective
on December 31, 2001 (the Bermuda Reorganization). Upon consummation, the shares of IR-New Jersey common stock were cancelled and all previous holders were issued IR-Limited Class A common shares. The Bermuda Reorganization was accounted
for as a reorganization of entities under common control and accordingly, did not result in any changes to the consolidated amounts of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity.

Ingersoll-Rand plc, an Irish public limited company (IR-Ireland), is the successor to IR-Limited, following a corporate reorganization that became effective on July 1, 2009 (the Ireland
Reorganization). Upon consummation, the shares of IR-Limited Class A common shares were cancelled and all previous holders were issued IR-Ireland ordinary shares. The Ireland Reorganization was accounted for as a reorganization of entities
under common control and accordingly, did not result in any changes to the consolidated amounts of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. See Note 2 for a further discussion of the Ireland Reorganization.

The Company treats common shares of the parent owned by a subsidiary as treasury stock. These shares are
recorded at cost and included in the Shareholders’ equity section. At December 31, 2007, Class A common shares of IR-Limited owned by the Company amounted to 97.4 million. As a result of the acquisition of Trane in June 2008, the
Company issued 45.4 million IR-Limited Class A common shares to fund the equity portion of the consideration. In June 2009, IR-Limited cancelled the remaining 52.0 million shares in anticipation of the Ireland Reorganization that
became effective on July 1, 2009.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:

NOTE 18 – SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company records share-based compensation awards using a fair value method and
recognizes compensation expense for an amount equal to the fair value of the share-based payment issued in its consolidated financial statements.

On June 3, 2009, the shareholders of the Company approved the amendment and restatement of the Incentive Stock Plan of 2007, which authorizes the Company to issue stock options and other share-based incentives. As a result, the total
number of shares authorized by the shareholders was increased to 27.0 million, of which 15.0 million remains available as of December 31, 2009 for future incentive awards.

Modifications Relating to the Reorganization

In connection with the Ireland Reorganization
discussed in Note 2, on July 1, 2009, IR-Ireland assumed the existing obligations of IR-Limited under the equity incentive plans and other similar employee award plans of Ingersoll Rand (collectively, the Plans), including all awards issued
thereunder. Furthermore, the Plans were amended by IR-Limited to provide (1) that ordinary shares of IR-Ireland will be issued, held available or used to measure benefits as appropriate under the Plans, in lieu of the Class A common shares
of IR-Limited, including upon exercise of any options or share appreciation rights or upon the vesting of restricted stock units or performance units issued under those Plans; and (2) for the appropriate substitution of IR-Ireland for
IR-Limited in those Plans.

F-39


Stock Options / Restricted
Stock Units

On February 12, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approved a change to the
Company’s equity grant approach whereby options are no longer used as the predominant equity vehicle for eligible participants; instead a mix of options and restricted stock units (RSUs) are utilized. The RSUs vest ratably over three years and
any accrued dividends will be paid in cash at the time of vesting. As a result of this change, eligible participants received (i) stock options, (ii) RSUs or (iii) a combination of both stock options and RSUs under the Company’s
Incentive Stock Plan of 2007.

The average fair value of the stock options granted for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was
estimated to be $5.82 per share and $11.56 per share, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following assumptions were used:

The fair value of each of the Company’s stock option awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the required service period, which is generally the three-year vesting period of the options.
However, for options granted to retirement eligible employees, the Company recognizes expense for the fair value of the options at the grant date. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility from traded options on the Company’s
stock. The risk-free rate of return is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award. Historical data is used to estimate forfeitures within the
Company’s valuation model. The Company’s expected life of the stock option awards is derived from historical experience and represents the period of time that awards are expected to be outstanding.

Changes in options outstanding under the plans for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 are as follows:

As part of the acquisition of Trane, 7.4 million Trane options were converted at the option of the holders into options to acquire shares of IR-Limited Class A common shares based on the option exchange ratio set forth in the
merger agreement.

F-40


The following table summarizes
information concerning currently outstanding and exercisable options:

At December 31, 2009, there was $28.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock option arrangements granted under the plan, which is related to unvested shares of non-retirement
eligible employees. This compensation will be recognized over the required service period, which is generally the three-year vesting period. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was
$16.5 million and $9.2 million, respectively.

Generally, stock options vest ratably over a three-year period from their date of grant and
expire at the end of ten years.

On February 12, 2009, the Company granted annual RSU awards. The fair value of each of the
Company’s RSU awards is measured as the grant-date price of the Company’s shares and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the three year vesting period. For RSUs granted to retirement eligible employees, the Company recognizes expense
for the fair value of the RSUs at the grant date. RSUs vest ratably over a three-year period.

The following table summarizes RSU activity
during the year ended December 31, 2009:

At December 31, 2009, there was $7.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from RSU arrangements granted under the plan, which is related to unvested shares of non-retirement eligible employees. This compensation will be
recognized over the required service period, which is generally the three-year vesting period.

F-41


SARs

All SARs outstanding as of December 31, 2009 are vested and expire ten years from the date of grant. All SARs exercised are settled with the
Company’s ordinary shares.

The following table summarizes the information for currently outstanding SARs:

Note: The Company did not grant SARS during 2007, 2008, and 2009 and does not anticipate further granting in the future.

Performance Shares

The Company has a Performance Share Program (PSP) for key employees. The program provides awards based on
performance against pre-established objectives. The target award level is expressed as a number of the Company’s ordinary shares. All PSP awards are settled in the form of ordinary shares.

On February 12, 2009, the Compensation Committee determined the PSP awards for the performance year 2008. In doing so, primary emphasis was placed on
financial objectives in light of the current economic environment. The 2008 PSP awards have a one-year vesting period.

On October 4,
2008, the Compensation Committee approved certain changes to the Company’s long-term incentive compensation programs to be implemented beginning with the 2009 performance year. Under these changes, the performance period under the
Company’s PSP Program was changed from one year to three years starting with year 2009 in order to increase the long-term nature of incentive compensation for PSP participants. In addition, these PSP awards are based on the Company’s
relative EPS growth as compared to the industrial group of companies in the S&P 500 Index over the three-year performance period. To transition between the previous one-year PSP program and the revised three year PSP program, there is a one-time
PSP award with a two-year performance period for 2009 through 2010, which is based on the Company’s EPS growth relative to the industrial group of companies in the S&P 500 Index and the publicly announced Trane acquisition synergy savings.

F-42


Deferred Compensation

The Company allows key employees to defer a portion of their eligible compensation into a number of investment choices, including ordinary
share equivalents. Any amounts invested in ordinary share equivalents will be settled in ordinary shares at the time of distribution.

Other Plans

The Company maintains a shareholder-approved Management Incentive Unit Award Plan. Under the plan, participating
key employees were awarded incentive units. When dividends are paid on ordinary shares, phantom dividends are awarded to unit holders, one-half of which is paid in cash, the remaining half of which is credited to the participants’ accounts in
the form of ordinary share equivalents. The value of the actual incentive units is never paid to participants, and only the fair value of accumulated ordinary share equivalents is paid in cash upon the participants’ retirement. The number of
ordinary share equivalents credited to participants’ accounts at December 31, 2009 is 109,480.

The Company has issued stock grants
as an incentive plan for certain key employees, with varying vesting periods. All stock grants are settled with the Company’s ordinary shares. At December 31, 2009, there were 278,802 stock grants outstanding, all of which were vested.

Compensation Expense

Share-based compensation expense is included in Selling and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes the expenses recognized:

NOTE 19 – OTHER, NET

At December 31, the components of Other, net were as follows:

Included in currency exchange gains (losses) above is a $24 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009, associated with the recent devaluation in the Venezuelan Bolivar. At December 31, 2009, the Company remeasured its
foreign currency receivables and payables associated with the Venezuelan Bolivar at the parallel

F-43


rate of 6.0 Bolivars for each U.S. dollar, based on the Company’s inability to settle certain transactions through the official government channels in an expeditious manner. Previously, the
Company remeasured all foreign currency transactions at the official rate of 2.15 Bolivars for each U.S. dollar. In addition, effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated highly inflationary, as the blended Consumer Price
Index/National Consumer Price Index reached cumulative three-year inflation in excess of 100% during the fourth quarter of 2009. As such, all future foreign currency fluctuations will be recorded in income.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded income of approximately $25 million primarily related to a favorable settlement with an insurance
carrier associated with a portion of the Company’s asbestos obligation, which is included in other in the table above.

The components of Provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

The Provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pretax income, as a result of the following
differences:

F-44


Tax incentives, in the form of
tax holidays, have been granted in certain jurisdictions to encourage industrial development. The expiration of these tax holidays varies by country. The most significant tax holiday relates to the Company’s qualifying locations in Ireland,
which were granted a 10% tax rate through 2010. The benefit for the tax holidays for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $1.4 million and $4.1 million, respectively.

At December 31, a summary of the deferred tax accounts were as follows:

At
December 31, 2009, no deferred taxes have been provided for any portion of the $6.0 billion of undistributed earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries, since these earnings have been, and under current plans will continue to be, permanently
reinvested in these subsidiaries, and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes which may be payable upon distribution.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had the following operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset taxable income in prior and future years:

The U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards were incurred in various jurisdictions. The non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards were incurred in various jurisdictions, predominantly in Belgium, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

F-45


Activity associated with the
Company’s valuation allowance is as follows:

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” (ASC 740) which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on the recognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. As a result of adopting these
provisions of ASC 740 as of January 1, 2007, the company recorded additional liabilities to its previously established reserves, and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings of $145.6 million.

The Company has total unrecognized tax benefits of $525.1 million and $589.6 million as of December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively.
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate are $453.4 million as of December 31, 2009. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

In connection with Trane’s spin-off of WABCO, Trane and WABCO entered into a tax sharing agreement for the allocation of pre spin-off taxes. Of the total unrecognized tax benefit of $525.1 million at December 31, 2009, WABCO has
agreed to indemnify Trane for $28.3 million, which is reflected in an other long-term receivable account.

The Company records interest and
penalties associated with the uncertain tax positions within its Provision for income taxes. The Company had reserves associated with interest and penalties, net of tax, of $80.3 million and $91.3 million at December 31, 2009, and
December 31, 2008, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company recognized $6.3 million and $20.7 million, respectively, in interest and penalties net of tax related to these uncertain tax
positions.

It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change within 12 months as a result of
settlements of ongoing tax examinations resulting in a decrease of approximately $8.2 million in the unrecognized tax benefits.

F-46


The provision for income taxes
involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could
change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by the Company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions, timing and amount of income or
deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority
with respect to that return. In the normal course of business the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Brazil, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and the
United States. In general, the examination of the Company’s material tax returns is completed for the years prior to 2000, with certain matters being resolved through appeals and litigation.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed the examination of the Company’s federal income tax returns through the 2000 tax year and has issued a
notice proposing adjustments. The principal proposed adjustment relates to the disallowance of certain capital losses. In order to reduce the potential interest expense associated with this matter, the Company made a payment of $217 million in the
third quarter of 2007, which reduced the Company’s total liability for uncertain tax positions by $141 million. Similarly, during the third quarter of 2008, the Company made an additional payment of $55.1 million related to a potential penalty
assessment plus accrued interest on this matter. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company reached a settlement of this matter with the IRS which resulted in no additional payments or charges.

On July 20, 2007, the Company received a notice from the IRS containing proposed adjustments to the Company’s tax filings in connection with an
audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years. The IRS did not contest the validity of the Company’s reincorporation in Bermuda. The most significant adjustments proposed by the IRS involve treating the entire intercompany debt incurred in connection
with the Company’s reincorporation in Bermuda as equity. As a result of this recharacterization, the IRS disallowed the deduction of interest paid on the debt and imposed dividend withholding taxes on the payments denominated as interest. The
IRS also asserted an alternative argument to be applied if the intercompany debt is respected as debt. In that circumstance the IRS proposed to ignore the entities that hold the debt and to which the interest was paid and impose 30% withholding tax
on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced U.S withholding tax under a U.S income tax treaty. The IRS asserted under this alternative theory that the Company owes additional
taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately $84 million plus interest. If either of these positions were upheld in their entirety the Company would be required to record additional charges. The Company strongly disagreed with the view of the IRS and
filed a protest with the IRS in the third quarter of 2007.

On January 12, 2010, the Company received an amended notice from the IRS
eliminating its assertion that the intercompany debt incurred in connection with the Company’s reincorporation in Bermuda should be treated as equity. However, the IRS continues to assert the alternative position described above and proposes
adjustments to the Company’s 2001 and 2002 tax filings. In addition, the IRS provided notice on January 19, 2010, that it is assessing penalties of 30% on the asserted underpayment of tax described above.

The Company has and intends to continue to vigorously contest these proposed adjustments. The Company, in consultation with its outside advisors, carefully
considered the form and substance of the Company’s intercompany financing arrangements including the actions necessary to qualify for the benefits of the applicable U.S. income tax treaties. The Company believes that these financing
arrangements are in accordance with the laws of the relevant jurisdictions including the U.S., that the entities involved should be respected and that the interest payments qualify for the U.S income tax treaty benefits claimed.

F-47


Although the outcome of this
matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based upon an analysis of the strength of its position, the Company believes that it is adequately reserved for this matter. As the Company moves forward to resolve this matter with the IRS, it is
reasonably possible that the reserves established may be adjusted within the next 12 months. However, the Company does not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on its future results of operations or financial
position. At this time, the IRS has not proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2002. However, if all or a portion of these adjustments proposed by the IRS are ultimately sustained, it is likely to also affect subsequent tax years.

The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of any tax disputes, but will adjust its
reserves if events so dictate in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from the original or adjusted estimates of the Company, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes.

During 2009, the Company identified certain accounting errors associated with its previously reported income tax balance sheet accounts. The Company
corrected these errors in 2009, which resulted in a tax benefit for the year of $13 million recorded to continuing operations, of which $10 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, and a tax charge for the year of $29 million recorded to
discontinued operations. The Company does not believe that the accounting errors are material to 2009 or to any of its previously issued financial statements. As a result, the Company did not adjust any prior period amounts.

In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a tax charge of approximately $54 million (net of federal benefit) associated with
increasing its deferred tax asset valuation allowances for state net operating losses. In addition, the Company wrote-off foreign tax credit carryforwards and recorded a tax charge of $42 million in the third quarter of 2009.

NOTE 21 – DIVESTITURES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The components of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

During 2009, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $28 million primarily associated with reducing its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and a tax charge of $29 million associated with correcting immaterial accounting errors. See Note
20 for a further description of these tax matters.

Pre-tax loss from operations in 2007 includes a non-cash charge of $449.0 million related
to the Company’s liability for all pending and estimated future asbestos claims through 2053 as discussed below in “Other Discontinued Operations”.

Discontinued operations by business for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

Compact Equipment
Divestiture

On July 29, 2007, the Company agreed to sell its Bobcat, Utility Equipment and Attachments businesses (collectively,
Compact Equipment) to Doosan Infracore for gross proceeds of approximately $4.9 billion, subject to post-closing purchase price adjustments. The sale was completed on November 30, 2007. We are currently in the process of resolving the final
purchase price adjustments with Doosan Infracore.

Compact Equipment manufactured and sold compact equipment, including skid-steer loaders,
compact track loaders, mini-excavators and telescopic tool handlers; portable air compressors, generators and light towers; general-purpose light construction equipment; and attachments. The Company accounted for Compact Equipment as discontinued
operations within the income statement.

Net revenues and after-tax earnings of Compact Equipment for the years ended December 31 were as
follows:

Road Development Divestiture

On February 27, 2007, the Company agreed to sell its Road Development business unit to AB
Volvo (publ) for cash proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. The sale was completed on April 30, 2007.

The Road Development business
unit manufactured and sold asphalt paving equipment, compaction equipment, milling machines and construction-related material handling equipment. The Company accounted for the Road Development business unit as discontinued operations within the
income statement.

Net revenues and after-tax earnings of the Road Development business unit for the years ended December 31 were as
follows:

Other Discontinued Operations

The Company
also has retained costs from previously sold businesses that mainly include costs related to postretirement benefits, product liability and legal costs (mostly asbestos-related). The components of other discontinued operations for the years ended

NOTE 22 – EARNINGS PER
SHARE (EPS)

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing Net earnings (loss) attibutable to Ingersoll-Rand plc by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS is calculated after adjusting the denominator of the basic EPS calculation for the effect of all potentially dilutive common shares, which in the Company’s case, includes shares
issuable under share-based compensation plans and the effects of the Exchangeable Senior Notes issued in April 2009. The following table summarizes the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share
calculations:

As the Company experienced a net loss in 2008, the Company did not included the impact of shares issuable under incentive stock plans in the calculation of diluted EPS as the result would have an antidilutive effect on EPS.

NOTE 23 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental and product liability matters. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are
reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, management believes that the liability which may result from
these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters

The Company continues to be dedicated to an environmental program to
reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, the Company is currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to
address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities.

The Company is sometimes a party to
environmental lawsuits and claims and has received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state authorities. It has also been identified as a potentially responsible
party (PRP) for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, the Company’s involvement is minimal.

In estimating its liability, the Company has assumed it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be
jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based generally on the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving
environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future.

During 2009, we spent $10.8 million for environmental remediation
at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company has recorded reserves for environmental matters of $93.3 million and $100.9 million, respectively. The Company believes that these expenditures
and accrual levels will continue and may increase over time. Given the evolving nature of environmental laws, regulations and technology, the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain.

F-50


Asbestos Matters

Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In
virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims has been filed against either Ingersoll-Rand Company (IR-New Jersey) or Trane and generally allege injury caused by
exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by IR-New Jersey or Trane, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. Neither IR-New Jersey nor Trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos, however, some formerly
manufactured products utilized asbestos-containing components such as gaskets and packings purchased from third-party suppliers.

Prior to the
fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a liability (which it periodically updated) for its actual and anticipated future asbestos settlement costs projected seven years into the future. The Company did not record a liability for future
asbestos settlement costs beyond the seven-year period covered by its reserve because such costs previously were not reasonably estimable for the reasons detailed below.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company again reviewed its history and experience with asbestos-related litigation and determined that it had now become possible to make a reasonable estimate of its
total liability for pending and unasserted potential future asbestos-related claims. This determination was based upon the Company’s analysis of developments in asbestos litigation, including the substantial and continuing decline in the filing
of non-malignancy claims against the Company, the establishment in many jurisdictions of inactive or deferral dockets for such claims, the decreased value of non-malignancy claims because of changes in the legal and judicial treatment of such
claims, increasing focus of the asbestos litigation upon malignancy claims, primarily those involving mesothelioma, a cancer with a known historical and predictable future annual incidence rate, and the Company’s substantial accumulated
experience with respect to the resolution of malignancy claims, particularly mesothelioma claims, filed against it.

Accordingly, in the
fourth quarter of 2007, the Company retained Dr. Thomas Vasquez of Analysis, Research & Planning Corporation (collectively, “ARPC”) to assist it in calculating an estimate of the Company’s total liability for pending and
unasserted future asbestos-related claims. ARPC is a respected expert in performing complex calculations such as this. ARPC has been involved in many asbestos-related valuations of current and future liabilities, and its valuation methodologies have
been accepted by numerous courts.

The methodology used by ARPC to project the Company’s total liability for pending and unasserted
potential future asbestos-related claims relied upon and included the following factors, among others:

•

ARPC’s interpretation of a widely accepted forecast of the population likely to have been occupationally exposed to asbestos;

•

epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma and lung cancer;

•

the Company’s historical experience with the filing of non-malignancy claims against it and the historical ratio between the numbers of
non-malignancy and lung cancer claims filed against the Company;

•

ARPC’s analysis of the number of people likely to file an asbestos-related personal injury claim against the Company based on such epidemiological
and historical data and the Company’s most recent three-year claims history;

•

an analysis of the Company’s pending cases, by type of disease claimed;

•

an analysis of the Company’s most recent three-year history to determine the average settlement and resolution value of claims, by type of disease
claimed;

F-51


•

an adjustment for inflation in the future average settlement value of claims, at a 2.5% annual inflation rate, adjusted downward to 1.5% to take
account of the declining value of claims resulting from the aging of the claimant population;

•

an analysis of the period over which the Company has and is likely to resolve asbestos-related claims against it in the future.

Based on these factors, ARPC calculated a total estimated liability of $755 million for the Company to resolve all
pending and unasserted potential future claims through 2053, which is ARPC’s reasonable best estimate of the time it will take to resolve asbestos-related claims. This amount is on a pre-tax basis, not discounted for the time-value of money,
and excludes the Company’s defense fees (which will continue to be expensed by the Company as they are incurred). After considering ARPC’s analysis and the factors listed above, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company increased its
recorded liability for asbestos claims by $538 million, from $217 million to $755 million.

In addition, during the fourth
quarter of 2007, the Company recorded an $89 million increase in its assets for probable asbestos-related insurance recoveries to $250 million. This represents amounts due to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the
probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims. In calculating this amount, the Company used the estimated asbestos liability for pending and projected future claims calculated by ARPC. It also considered
the amount of insurance available, gaps in coverage, allocation methodologies, solvency ratings and creditworthiness of the insurers, the amounts already recovered from and the potential for settlements with insurers, and the terms of existing
settlement agreements with insurers.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a non-cash charge to earnings of discontinued
operations of $449 million ($277 million after-tax), which is the difference between the amount by which the Company increased its total estimated liability for pending and projected future asbestos-related claims and the amount that the
Company expects to recover from insurers with respect to that increased liability.

In connection with our acquisition of Trane, the Company
requested ARPC to assist in calculating Trane’s asbestos-related valuations of current and future liabilities. As required by GAAP the Company is required to record the assumed asbestos obligations and associated insurance-related assets at
their fair value at the Acquisition Date. The Company estimated that the assumed asbestos obligation and associated insurance-related assets at the Acquisition Date to be $494 million and $249 million, respectively. These amounts were estimated
based on certain assumptions and factors consistent with those described above.

Trane continues to be in litigation against certain carriers
whose policies it believes provide coverage for asbestos claims. The insurance carriers named in this suit have challenged Trane’s right to recovery. Trane filed the action in April 1999 in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County,
against various primary and lower layer excess insurance carriers, seeking coverage for environmental claims (the “NJ Litigation”). The NJ Litigation was later expanded to also seek coverage for asbestos-related liabilities from twenty-one
primary and lower layer excess carriers and underwriting syndicates. The environmental claims against the insurers in the NJ Litigation have been resolved or dismissed without prejudice for later resolution. On September 19, 2005, the
court granted Trane’s motion to add claims for insurance coverage for asbestos-related liabilities against 16 additional insurers and 117 new insurance policies to the NJ Litigation. The court also required the parties to submit all contested
matters to mediation. Trane engaged in its first mediation session with the NJ Litigation defendants on January 18, 2006 and has engaged in active discussions since that time.

Trane has now settled with the majority of the insurers in the NJ Litigation, collectively accounting for approximately 95% of its recorded asbestos-related liability insurance receivable as of
January 31, 2010. Most, although not all, of Trane’s settlement agreements constitute “coverage-in-place” arrangements, in which the insurer signatories agree to reimburse Trane for specified portions of its costs for
asbestos bodily injury claims and Trane agrees to certain claims-handling protocols and grants to the insurer signatories certain releases and indemnifications.

F-52


More specifically, effective
August 26, 2008, Trane entered into a coverage-in-place agreement (“August 26 Agreement”) with the following five insurance companies or groups: 1) Hartford; 2) Travelers; 3) Allstate (solely in its capacity as successor-in-interest
to Northbrook Excess & Surplus Insurance Company); 4) Dairyland Insurance Company; and 5) AIG. In addition, on September 12, 2008, Trane entered into a settlement agreement with Mt. McKinley Insurance Company and Everest
Reinsurance Company, both members of the Everest Re group, resolving all claims in the NJ Litigation involving policies issued by those companies (“Everest Re Agreement”). The Everest Re Agreement contains a number of elements,
including policy buy-outs and partial buy-outs in exchange for a cash payment along with coverage-in-place features similar to those contained in the August 26 Agreement, in exchange for certain releases and indemnifications by
Trane. Further, on January 26, 2009, Trane entered into a coverage-in-place agreement with Columbia Casualty Company, Continental Casualty Company, and Continental Insurance Company (“CNA Agreement”), and agreed to a dismissal
without prejudice of its environmental claims against CNA. Trane also has reached a coverage-in-place agreement, effective December 15, 2009, with Century Indemnity Company and International Insurance Company (“Century-International
Agreement”). The Century-Indemnity Agreement has an initial term of three years, which renews automatically for successive three year terms unless either Trane or the insurer signatories elect to forward to the other party a notice of
non-renewal. Most recently, effective February 4, 2010, Trane reached an agreement with certain London market insurance companies (“LMC Agreement”) that resolved all claims against the policies at issue. The LMC Agreement provides for
the periodic reimbursement by the insurer signatories of a portion of Trane’s costs for asbestos bodily injury claims based on the attainment of certain aggregate indemnity and defense payment thresholds, and in exchange for certain releases
and indemnifications from Trane. Trane also reached agreement on December 31, 2009 with Harper Insurance Company (“Harper”), a party to the LMC Agreement, for the buy-out of Harper’s obligations to Trane under the LMC Agreement
and for certain releases and indemnifications from Trane in exchange for a one-time cash payment by Harper. Trane remains in settlement negotiations with the few insurer defendants in the NJ Litigation not encompassed within the August 26
Agreement, the Everest Re Agreement, the CNA Agreement, the Century-International Agreement and the LMC Agreement. In addition to its pursuit of coverage from its solvent insurers as outlined above, Trane also is pursuing claims against the
estates of insolvent insurers in connection with its costs for asbestos bodily injury claims.

The amounts recorded by the Company for
asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets are based on currently available information. The Company’s actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in
the Company’s or ARPC’s calculations vary significantly from actual results. Key variables in these assumptions are identified above and include the number and type of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of resolution of
each such new claim, the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers, and the solvency risk with respect to the Company’s insurance carriers. Furthermore, predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty
as the projection period lengthens. Other factors that may affect the Company’s liability include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms that may be made by state and
federal courts, and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation.

The aggregate amount of the stated limits in insurance policies
available to the Company for asbestos-related claims acquired over many years and from many different carriers, is substantial. However, limitations in that coverage, primarily due to the considerations described above, are expected to result in the
projected total liability to claimants substantially exceeding the probable insurance recovery.

From receipt of its first asbestos claims
more than twenty five years ago to December 31, 2009, the Company has resolved (by settlement or dismissal) approximately 256,000 claims arising from the legacy Ingersoll Rand businesses. The total amount of all settlements paid by the Company
(excluding insurance recoveries) and by its insurance carriers is approximately $410 million, for an average payment per resolved claim of $1,595. The average payment per claim resolved during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $12,136.
Because claims are frequently filed and settled in large groups, the amount and timing of settlements, as well as the number of open claims, can fluctuate significantly from period to period.

F-53


The table below provides
additional information regarding asbestos-related claims filed against the legacy Ingersoll Rand businesses, excluding those filed against Trane, reflecting updated information for the last three years.

* The significant increase in dismissals in 2008 is attributed to the dismissal of large numbers of dormant and/or inactive cases in Mississippi and New York. This amount reflects the Company’s
emphasis on resolution of higher value malignancy claims, particularly mesothelioma claims, rather than lower value non-malignancy claims, which are more heavily represented in the Company’s historical settlements.

From receipt of the first asbestos claim more than twenty years ago through December 31, 2009, the Company has resolved approximately 86,646 (by
settlement or dismissal) claims arising from the legacy Trane business. The Company and its insurance carriers have paid settlements of approximately $148 million on these claims, which represents an average payment per resolved claim of $1,710. At
December 31, 2009, there were 92,298 open claims pending against Trane. Because claims are frequently filed and settled in large groups, the amount and timing of settlements, as well as the number of open claims, can fluctuate significantly
from period to period.

The table below provides additional information regarding asbestos-related claims filed against the legacy Trane
businesses, reflecting updated information for the last three years.

At December 31, 2009, over 91 percent of the open claims against the Company are non-malignancy claims, many of which have been placed on inactive or deferral dockets and the vast majority of which
have little or no settlement value against the Company, particularly in light of recent changes in the legal and judicial treatment of such claims.

At December 31, 2009, the Company’s liability for asbestos related matters and the asset for probable asbestos-related insurance recoveries totaled $1,113.1 million and $424.2 million, respectively, compared to $1,195.2 million
and $423.8 million at December 31, 2008.

The (costs) income associated with the settlement and defense of asbestos related claims after
insurance recoveries were as follows:

F-54


The Company records certain
income and expenses associated with its asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within discontinued operations, as they relate to previously divested businesses, primarily Ingersoll-Dresser Pump, which was sold in 2000. Income
and expenses associated with Trane’s asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries are recorded within continuing operations.

The European Commission Investigation

In November 2004, Trane was contacted by the European Commission as part of a
multi-company investigation into possible infringement of European Union competition law relating to the distribution of bathroom fixtures and fittings in certain European countries. On March 28, 2007, Trane, along with a number of other
companies, received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission. The Statement of Objections, an administrative complaint, alleges infringements of European Union competition rules by numerous bathroom fixture and fittings companies,
including Trane and certain of its former European subsidiaries engaged in the Bath and Kitchen business. These former subsidiaries were transferred (i) to WABCO on July 31, 2007 as part of a legal reorganization in connection with the
spinoff of Trane’s Vehicle Control Systems business and (ii) to Bain Capital Partners LLC on October 31, 2007 in connection with the sale of Trane’s Bath & Kitchen business. Trane and certain of its former European
subsidiaries will be jointly and severally liable for any fines that result from the investigation. However, pursuant to an Indemnification and Cooperation Agreement among Trane and certain other parties (Indemnification Agreement), American
Standard Europe BVBA (renamed WABCO Europe BVBA) (WABCO Europe), which is a subsidiary of WABCO following the reorganization, will be responsible for, and will indemnify Trane and its subsidiaries (including certain subsidiaries formerly engaged in
the Bath and Kitchen business) and their respective affiliates against, any fines related to this investigation. Trane and the charged subsidiaries responded to the European Commission on August 1, 2007 and July 31, 2007, respectively. A
hearing with the European Commission regarding the response to the Statement of Objections was conducted from November 12-14, 2007, in Brussels. WABCO Europe and other former Trane subsidiaries participated in the hearing. Trane, however, did
not participate in the hearing.

In 2006, the European Commission adopted new fining guidelines (2006 Guidelines) and stated its intention to
apply these guidelines in all cases in which a Statement of Objections is issued after September 2006. In applying the 2006 Guidelines, the Commission retains considerable discretion in calculating the fine although the European Union regulations
provide for a cap on the maximum fine equal to ten percent of Trane’s worldwide revenue attributable to all of its products for the fiscal year prior to the year in which the fine is imposed. If the maximum fine is levied in 2010, the total
liability could be as high as $1.1 billion based on Trane’s last full fiscal year of worldwide revenue attributable to all of its product lines owned at the time the Statement of Objections was issued, subject to a probable reduction for
leniency of at least 20 percent provided WABCO Europe, as the leniency applicant, fulfilled all conditions set forth in the European Commission’s leniency notice. WABCO has stated in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2009, that its ability to satisfy its obligations under the Indemnification Agreement is contingent on its funding capability at the time of the fine, which could be affected by, among other things, its ability to access its then
existing credit facilities, its ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, its ability to obtain some payment relief from the European Commission or its ability to obtain a suspension of the payment obligation from the European Court of
First Instance.

Oil for Food Program

As previously reported, on November 10, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an Order directing that a number of public companies, including the Company, provide information relating to their participation in
transactions under the United Nations’ Oil for Food Program. Upon receipt of the Order, the Company undertook a thorough review of its participation in the Oil for Food Program, provided the SEC with information responsive to the Order and
provided additional information requested by the SEC. During a March 27, 2007 meeting with the SEC, at which a representative of the Department of Justice (DOJ) was also present, the Company began discussions concerning the resolution of this
matter with both the SEC and DOJ. On October 31, 2007, the Company announced it had reached settlements with the SEC and DOJ relating to this matter. Under the terms of the settlements, the Company paid a total of $6.7 million in penalties,
interest and disgorgement of profits. The Company has consented to the entry of a civil injunction in the SEC action and has

F-55


entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ. Under both settlements, the Company has implemented and will continue to implement improvements to its
compliance program that are consistent with its longstanding policy against improper payments. In the settlement documents, the Government noted that the Company thoroughly cooperated with the investigation, that the Company had conducted its own
complete investigation of the conduct at issue, promptly and thoroughly reported its findings to them, and took prompt remedial measures.

Additionally, we have reported to the DOJ and SEC certain matters involving Trane, including one relating to the Oil for Food Program, and which raise potential issues under the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. With respect
to these matters, we have conducted a thorough investigation, which began in earnest promptly after our acquisition of Trane in June 2008. Previously, we had reported to the SEC and DOJ potential FCPA issues relating to one of our businesses in
China, and we have reported back to them and shared our audit report, which indicated no FCPA violations. With respect to that same business in China, we have discussed with the DOJ and SEC another matter which raises potential FCPA issues. We have
had preliminary discussions concerning the foregoing with the SEC and DOJ, to be followed by further discussions about them and possibly other matters which raise potential FCPA concerns. These matters (and others which may arise or of which we
become aware in the future) may be deemed to violate the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Such determinations could subject us to, among other things, further enforcement actions by the SEC or the DOJ (if, for example, the DOJ deems
us to have violated the DPA), securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the market value of our stock.

Warranty Liability

The following
represents the changes in the Company’s product warranty liability for 2009 and 2008:

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Certain office and warehouse facilities, transportation vehicles and data processing
equipment are leased by the Company. Total rental expense was $194.9 million in 2009, $144.8 million in 2008 and $72.2 million in 2007. Minimum lease payments required under non-cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year for the
next five years and thereafter, are as follows: $169.9 million in 2010, $137.6 million in 2011, $104.4 million in 2012, $76.8 million in 2013, $61.4 million in 2014 and $123.9 million thereafter.

Trane has commitments and performance guarantees, including energy savings guarantees, totaling $157.5 million extending from 2010-2030. These guarantees
are provided under long-term service and maintenance contracts related to its air conditioning equipment and system controls. Through 2009, the Company has experienced one insignificant loss under such arrangements and considers the probability of
any significant future losses to be remote.

The Company also has other contingent liabilities of $3.6 million. These liabilities primarily
result from performance bonds, guarantees and stand-by letters of credit associated with the prior sale of products from divested businesses as well as existing loan guarantees and residual values of equipment.

As part of the reorganization of IR-New Jersey in 2001, IR-Limited fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the issued public debt securities IR-New
Jersey. IR-New Jersey unconditionally guaranteed payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest on IR-Limited’s 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2015 in aggregate principal

F-56


amount of $300 million. The guarantee is unsecured and provided on an unsubordinated basis. The guarantee ranks equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future unsecured and
unsubordinated debt of IR-New Jersey. In addition, public debt securities issued by IR Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited.

As a part of the reorganization of IR-Limited in 2009, the guarantee structure was updated to reflect the newly created legal structure under which (i) IR-International assumed the obligations of
IR-Limited as issuer or guarantor, as the case may be, and (ii) IR-Ireland and IR-Limited fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations under the various indentures covering the currently outstanding public debt of IR-International,
IR-Global and IR-New Jersey. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited has issued or intends to issue guarantees in respect of any indebtedness incurred by Trane.

NOTE 24 – BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The accounting policies of the operating
segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies except that the operating segments’ results are prepared on a management basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company disaggregates
financial information for internal review and decision making. The Company largely evaluates performance based on operating income and operating margins. Intercompany sales between segments are considered immaterial.

The Company has divested various businesses over the past few years as it moves to being a leading global diversified industrial enterprise. During 2007,
the Company sold its Bobcat, Utility Equipment and Attachments business units as well as its Road Development business unit. Segment information for all years has been revised to exclude the results of these divestitures.

Each reportable segment is based primarily on the types of products it generates. The operating segments have been aggregated as required by GAAP.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company realigned its external reporting structure to more closely reflect our corporate and business
strategies and to promote additional productivity and growth. The Company’s segments are now as follows: Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies. As part of the change, the Company eliminated
the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment which represented the acquired Trane business and created two new reportable segments, the Climate Solutions segment and the Residential Solutions segment.

A description of the Company’s reportable segments is as follows:

The Climate Solutions segment delivers energy-efficient refrigeration and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) solutions throughout the world. Encompassing the transport and stationary
refrigeration markets as well as the commercial HVAC markets, this segment offers customers a broad range of products, services and solutions to manage controlled temperature environments. This segment includes the market leading brands of Hussmann,
Thermo King and Trane.

The Residential Solutions segment provides safety, comfort and efficiency to homeowners throughout North America and
parts of South America. It offers customers a broad range of products, services and solutions including mechanical and electronic locks, energy-efficient HVAC systems, indoor air quality solutions, advanced controls, portable security systems and
remote home management. This segment is comprised of well-known brands like American Standard, Schlage and Trane.

The Industrial Technologies
segment provides products, services and solutions that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. It offers our global customers a diverse and innovative range of products including compressed air systems, tools, pumps, fluid handling
systems, golf and utility vehicles in addition to environmentally friendly micro turbines. This segment includes the Club Car and Ingersoll Rand market leading brands.

F-57


The Security Technologies
segment is a leading global provider of products and services that make environments safe, secure and productive. The segment’s market-leading products include electronic and biometric access control systems, locks and locksets, door closers,
floor closers, exit devices, steel doors and frames, portable security devices, decorative hardware, cabinet hardware as well as time, attendance and personnel scheduling systems. These products serve a wide range of markets including the commercial
and residential housing market, healthcare, retail, maritime, transport industries as well as educational and governmental facilities. This segment includes the CISA, LCN, Schlage and Von Duprin brands.

A summary of operations by reportable segments for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

NOTE 25 – GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Ingersoll-Rand plc, an Irish public limited
company (IR-Ireland), is the successor to Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited, a Bermuda company (IR-Limited), following a corporate reorganization that became effective on July 1, 2009 (the Ireland Reorganization). IR-Limited is the successor to
Ingersoll-Rand Company, a New Jersey corporation (IR-New Jersey), following a corporate reorganization that occurred on December 31, 2001 (the Bermuda Reorganization). Both the Ireland Reorganization and the Bermuda Reorganization were
accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control and accordingly, did not result in any changes to the consolidated amounts of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity.

As a part of the Bermuda Reorganization, IR-Limited issued non-voting, Class B common shares to IR-New Jersey and certain IR-New Jersey subsidiaries in
exchange for a $3.6 billion note and shares of certain IR-New Jersey subsidiaries. The note, which is due in 2011, has a fixed rate of interest of 11% per annum payable semi-annually and imposes certain restrictive covenants upon IR-New Jersey.
At December 31, 2009, $1.0 billion of the original $3.6 billion note remains outstanding. In 2002, IR-Limited contributed the note to a wholly owned subsidiary, which subsequently transferred portions of the note to several other subsidiaries,
all of which are included in the “Other Subsidiaries” below. Accordingly, the subsidiaries of IR-Limited remain creditors of IR-New Jersey.

In addition, as part of the Bermuda Reorganization, IR-Limited fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the issued public debt securities of IR-New Jersey. IR-New Jersey unconditionally guaranteed payment of the principal, premium, if
any, and interest on IR-Limited’s 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2015 in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The guarantee is unsecured and provided on an unsubordinated basis. The guarantee ranks equally in right of payment with all of
the existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt of IR-New Jersey.

During 2008, the Company revised the guarantor financial
statements for all periods presented in order to reflect Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global) as a stand-alone subsidiary. IR-Global issued public debt that is guaranteed by IR-Limited.

As part of the Ireland Reorganization, the guarantor financial statements were further revised to present IR-Ireland as the ultimate parent company and
Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited (IR-International) as a stand-alone subsidiary. In addition, the guarantee structure was updated to reflect the newly created legal structure under which (i) IR-International assumed the obligations
of IR-Limited as issuer or guarantor, as the case may be, and (ii) IR-Ireland and IR-Limited fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations under the various indentures covering the currently outstanding public debt of IR-International,
IR-Global and IR-New Jersey. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited has issued or intends to issue guarantees in respect of any indebtedness

F-59


incurred by Trane. Also as part of the Ireland Reorganization, IR-Limited transferred all the shares of IR-Global to IR-International in exchange for a note payable that initially approximated
$15.0 billion, which was then immediately reduced by the settlement of net intercompany payables of $4.1 billion. At December 31, 2009, $10.8 billion remains outstanding.

The condensed consolidating financial statements present the investments of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited, IR-Global, IR-International and IR-New Jersey and their subsidiaries using the equity method of
accounting. Intercompany investments in the non-voting Class B common shares are accounted for on the cost method and are reduced by intercompany dividends. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the amounts related to the
issuance of the Class B shares have been presented as a reduction of Total shareholders’ equity. The notes payable continue to be reflected as a liability on the balance sheet of IR-New Jersey and are enforceable in accordance with their terms.

See Note 13 and 23 for a further discussion on the public debt issuance and related guarantees.

F-60


The following condensed
consolidated financial information for IR-Ireland, IR-Limited, IR-Global, IR-International and IR-New Jersey, and all their other subsidiaries is included so that separate financial statements of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited, IR-International, IR-Global
and IR-New Jersey are not required to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
